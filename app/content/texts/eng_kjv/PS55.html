<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS55_3" data-id="PS55_3">Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS55_12" data-id="PS55_12">For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:</span>
