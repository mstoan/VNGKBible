<div class="c">7</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_1" data-id="WS7_1">I myself also am a mortal man, like to all, and the offspring of him that was first made of the earth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_2" data-id="WS7_2">And in my mother's womb was fashioned to be flesh in the time of ten months, being compacted in blood, of the seed of man, and the pleasure that came with sleep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_3" data-id="WS7_3">And when I was born, I drew in the common air, and fell upon the earth, which is of like nature, and the first voice which I uttered was crying, as all others do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_4" data-id="WS7_4">I was nursed in swaddling clothes, and that with cares.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_5" data-id="WS7_5">For there is no king that had any other beginning of birth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_6" data-id="WS7_6">For all men have one entrance into life, and the like going out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_7" data-id="WS7_7">Wherefore I prayed, and understanding was given me: I called upon God, and the spirit of wisdom came to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_8" data-id="WS7_8">I preferred her before sceptres and thrones, and esteemed riches nothing in comparison of her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_9" data-id="WS7_9">Neither compared I unto her any precious stone, because all gold in respect of her is as a little sand, and silver shall be counted as clay before her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_10" data-id="WS7_10">I loved her above health and beauty, and chose to have her instead of light: for the light that cometh from her never goeth out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_11" data-id="WS7_11">All good things together came to me with her, and innumerable riches in her hands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_12" data-id="WS7_12">And I rejoiced in them all, because wisdom goeth before them: and I knew not that she was the mother of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_13" data-id="WS7_13">I learned diligently, and do communicate her liberally: I do not hide her riches.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_14" data-id="WS7_14">For she is a treasure unto men that never faileth: which they that use become the friends of God, being commended for the gifts that come from learning.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_15" data-id="WS7_15">God hath granted me to speak as I would, and to conceive as is meet for the things that are given me: because it is he that leadeth unto wisdom, and directeth the wise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_16" data-id="WS7_16">For in his hand are both we and our words; all wisdom also, and knowledge of workmanship.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_17" data-id="WS7_17">For he hath given me certain knowledge of the things that are, namely, to know how the world was made, and the operation of the elements:</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_18" data-id="WS7_18">The beginning, ending, and midst of the times: the alterations of the turning of the sun, and the change of seasons:</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_19" data-id="WS7_19">The circuits of years, and the positions of stars:</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_20" data-id="WS7_20">The natures of living creatures, and the furies of wild beasts: the violence of winds, and the reasonings of men: the diversities of plants and the virtues of roots:</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_21" data-id="WS7_21">And all such things as are either secret or manifest, them I know.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_22" data-id="WS7_22">For wisdom, which is the worker of all things, taught me: for in her is an understanding spirit holy, one only, manifold, subtil, lively, clear, undefiled, plain, not subject to hurt, loving the thing that is good quick, which cannot be letted, ready to do good,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_23" data-id="WS7_23">Kind to man, steadfast, sure, free from care, having all power, overseeing all things, and going through all understanding, pure, and most subtil, spirits.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_24" data-id="WS7_24">For wisdom is more moving than any motion: she passeth and goeth through all things by reason of her pureness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_25" data-id="WS7_25">For she is the breath of the power of God, and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty: therefore can no defiled thing fall into her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_26" data-id="WS7_26">For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_27" data-id="WS7_27">And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in herself, she maketh all things new: and in all ages entering into holy souls, she maketh them friends of God, and prophets.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_28" data-id="WS7_28">For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_29" data-id="WS7_29">For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the order of stars: being compared with the light, she is found before it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS7_30" data-id="WS7_30">For after this cometh night: but vice shall not prevail against wisdom.</span>
