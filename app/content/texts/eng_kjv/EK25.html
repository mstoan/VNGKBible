<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_4" data-id="EK25_4">Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_5" data-id="EK25_5">And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_6" data-id="EK25_6">For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped thine hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_7" data-id="EK25_7">Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_8" data-id="EK25_8">Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the heathen;</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_14" data-id="EK25_14">And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord GOD.</span>
