<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR22_6" data-id="SR22_6">A tale out of season [is as] musick in mourning: but stripes and correction of wisdom are never out of time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR22_7" data-id="SR22_7">Whoso teacheth a fool is as one that glueth a potsherd together, and as he that waketh one from a sound sleep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR22_8" data-id="SR22_8">He that telleth a tale to a fool speaketh to one in a slumber: when he hath told his tale, he will say, What is the matter?</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR22_14" data-id="SR22_14">What is heavier than lead? and what is the name thereof, but a fool?</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR22_15" data-id="SR22_15">Sand, and salt, and a mass of iron, is easier to bear, than a man without understanding.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR22_16" data-id="SR22_16">As timber girt and bound together in a building cannot be loosed with shaking: so the heart that is stablished by advised counsel shall fear at no time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR22_17" data-id="SR22_17">A heart settled upon a thought of understanding is as a fair plaistering on the wall of a gallery.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR22_18" data-id="SR22_18">Pales set on an high place will never stand against the wind: so a fearful heart in the imagination of a fool cannot stand against any fear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR22_19" data-id="SR22_19">He that pricketh the eye will make tears to fall: and he that pricketh the heart maketh it to shew her knowledge.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR22_20" data-id="SR22_20">Whoso casteth a stone at the birds frayeth them away: and he that upbraideth his friend breaketh friendship.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR22_21" data-id="SR22_21">Though thou drewest a sword at thy friend, yet despair not: for there may be a returning [to favour.]</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR22_22" data-id="SR22_22">If thou hast opened thy mouth against thy friend, fear not; for there may be a reconciliation: except for upbraiding, or pride, or disclosing of secrets, or a treacherous wound: for for these things every friend will depart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR22_23" data-id="SR22_23">Be faithful to thy neighbour in his poverty, that thou mayest rejoice in his prosperity: abide stedfast unto him in the time of his trouble, that thou mayest be heir with him in his heritage: for a mean estate is not always to be contemned: nor the rich that is foolish to be had in admiration.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR22_24" data-id="SR22_24">As the vapour and smoke of a furnace goeth before the fire; so reviling before blood.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR22_25" data-id="SR22_25">I will not be ashamed to defend a friend; neither will I hide myself from him.</span>
