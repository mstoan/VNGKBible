<div class="c">15</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE15_1" data-id="AE15_1">And upon the third day, when she had ended her prayers, she laid away her mourning garments, and put on her glorious apparel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE15_2" data-id="AE15_2">And being gloriously adorned, after she had called upon God, who is the beholder and saviour of all things, she took two maids with her:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE15_3" data-id="AE15_3">And upon the one she leaned, as carrying herself daintily;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE15_4" data-id="AE15_4">And the other followed, bearing up her train.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE15_5" data-id="AE15_5">And she was ruddy through the perfection of her beauty, and her countenance was cheerful and very amiable: but her heart was in anguish for fear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE15_6" data-id="AE15_6">Then having passed through all the doors, she stood before the king, who sat upon his royal throne, and was clothed with all his robes of majesty, all glittering with gold and precious stones; and he was very dreadful.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE15_7" data-id="AE15_7">Then lifting up his countenance that shone with majesty, he looked very fiercely upon her: and the queen fell down, and was pale, and fainted, and bowed herself upon the head of the maid that went before her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE15_8" data-id="AE15_8">Then God changed the spirit of the king into mildness, who in a fear leaped from his throne, and took her in his arms, till she came to herself again, and comforted her with loving words and said unto her,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE15_9" data-id="AE15_9">Esther, what is the matter? I am thy brother, be of good cheer:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE15_10" data-id="AE15_10">Thou shalt not die, though our our commandment be general: come near.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE15_11" data-id="AE15_11">And so be held up his golden sceptre, and laid it upon her neck,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE15_12" data-id="AE15_12">And embraced her, and said, Speak unto me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE15_13" data-id="AE15_13">Then said she unto him, I saw thee, my lord, as an angel of God, and my heart was troubled for fear of thy majesty.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE15_14" data-id="AE15_14">For wonderful art thou, lord, and thy countenance is full of grace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE15_15" data-id="AE15_15">And as she was speaking, she fell down for faintness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE15_16" data-id="AE15_16">Then the king was troubled, and all his servants comforted her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE5_3" data-id="AE5_3">Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE5_4" data-id="AE5_4">And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE5_5" data-id="AE5_5">Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE5_6" data-id="AE5_6">And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE5_7" data-id="AE5_7">Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE5_8" data-id="AE5_8">If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king hath said.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE5_9" data-id="AE5_9">Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE5_10" data-id="AE5_10">Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE5_11" data-id="AE5_11">And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE5_12" data-id="AE5_12">Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE5_13" data-id="AE5_13">Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE5_14" data-id="AE5_14">Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and tomorrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.</span>
