<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_2" data-id="PS106_2">Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_3" data-id="PS106_3">Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_4" data-id="PS106_4">Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_5" data-id="PS106_5">That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_6" data-id="PS106_6">We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_7" data-id="PS106_7">Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_8" data-id="PS106_8">Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_9" data-id="PS106_9">He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_11" data-id="PS106_11">And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_12" data-id="PS106_12">Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_13" data-id="PS106_13">They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_14" data-id="PS106_14">But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_15" data-id="PS106_15">And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_16" data-id="PS106_16">They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_17" data-id="PS106_17">The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_18" data-id="PS106_18">And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_19" data-id="PS106_19">They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_20" data-id="PS106_20">Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.</span>

<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_23" data-id="PS106_23">Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_24" data-id="PS106_24">Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_25" data-id="PS106_25">But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_26" data-id="PS106_26">Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_27" data-id="PS106_27">To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_28" data-id="PS106_28">They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_29" data-id="PS106_29">Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_30" data-id="PS106_30">Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_31" data-id="PS106_31">And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_32" data-id="PS106_32">They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_33" data-id="PS106_33">Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_34" data-id="PS106_34">They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_35" data-id="PS106_35">But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_36" data-id="PS106_36">And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_37" data-id="PS106_37">Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_38" data-id="PS106_38">And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_39" data-id="PS106_39">Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_40" data-id="PS106_40">Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_41" data-id="PS106_41">And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_42" data-id="PS106_42">Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_43" data-id="PS106_43">Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_44" data-id="PS106_44">Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_45" data-id="PS106_45">And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_46" data-id="PS106_46">He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_47" data-id="PS106_47">Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS106_48" data-id="PS106_48">Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.</span>
