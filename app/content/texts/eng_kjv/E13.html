<div class="c">3</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v E13_1" data-id="E13_1">Now when Darius reigned, he made a great feast unto all his subjects, and unto all his household, and unto all the princes of Media and Persia,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v E13_2" data-id="E13_2">And to all the governors and captains and lieutenants that were under him, from India unto Ethiopia, of an hundred twenty and seven provinces.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v E13_3" data-id="E13_3">And when they had eaten and drunken, and being satisfied were gone home, then Darius the king went into his bedchamber, and slept, and soon after awaked.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v E13_4" data-id="E13_4">Then three young men, that were of the guard that kept the king's body, spake one to another;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v E13_5" data-id="E13_5">Let every one of us speak a sentence: he that shall overcome, and whose sentence shall seem wiser than the others, unto him shall the king Darius give great gifts, and great things in token of victory:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v E13_6" data-id="E13_6">As, to be clothed in purple, to drink in gold, and to sleep upon gold, and a chariot with bridles of gold, and an headtire of fine linen, and a chain about his neck:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v E13_7" data-id="E13_7">And he shall sit next to Darius because of his wisdom, and shall be called Darius his cousin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v E13_8" data-id="E13_8">And then every one wrote his sentence, sealed it, and laid it under king Darius his pillow;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v E13_9" data-id="E13_9">And said that, when the king is risen, some will give him the writings; and of whose side the king and the three princes of Persia shall judge that his sentence is the wisest, to him shall the victory be given, as was appointed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v E13_10" data-id="E13_10">The first wrote, Wine is the strongest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v E13_11" data-id="E13_11">The second wrote, The king is strongest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v E13_12" data-id="E13_12">The third wrote, Women are strongest: but above all things Truth beareth away the victory.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v E13_13" data-id="E13_13">Now when the king was risen up, they took their writings, and delivered them unto him, and so he read them:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v E13_14" data-id="E13_14">And sending forth he called all the princes of Persia and Media, and the governors, and the captains, and the lieutenants, and the chief officers;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v E13_15" data-id="E13_15">And sat him down in the royal seat of judgment; and the writings were read before them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v E13_16" data-id="E13_16">And he said, Call the young men, and they shall declare their own sentences. So they were called, and came in.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v E13_17" data-id="E13_17">And he said unto them, Declare unto us your mind concerning the writings. Then began the first, who had spoken of the strength of wine;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v E13_18" data-id="E13_18">And he said thus, O ye men, how exceeding strong is wine! it causeth all men to err that drink it:</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v E13_19" data-id="E13_19">It maketh the mind of the king and of the fatherless child to be all one; of the bondman and of the freeman, of the poor man and of the rich:</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v E13_20" data-id="E13_20">It turneth also every thought into jollity and mirth, so that a man remembereth neither sorrow nor debt:</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v E13_21" data-id="E13_21">And it maketh every heart rich, so that a man remembereth neither king nor governor; and it maketh to speak all things by talents:</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v E13_22" data-id="E13_22">And when they are in their cups, they forget their love both to friends and brethren, and a little after draw out swords:</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v E13_23" data-id="E13_23">But when they are from the wine, they remember not what they have done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v E13_24" data-id="E13_24">O ye men, is not wine the strongest, that enforceth to do thus? And when he had so spoken, he held his peace.</span>
