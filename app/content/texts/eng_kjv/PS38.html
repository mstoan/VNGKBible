<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS38_2" data-id="PS38_2">For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS38_3" data-id="PS38_3">There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS38_4" data-id="PS38_4">For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS38_5" data-id="PS38_5">My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS38_6" data-id="PS38_6">I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS38_7" data-id="PS38_7">For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS38_8" data-id="PS38_8">I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS38_9" data-id="PS38_9">Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS38_10" data-id="PS38_10">My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS38_11" data-id="PS38_11">My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS38_12" data-id="PS38_12">They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS38_13" data-id="PS38_13">But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS38_14" data-id="PS38_14">Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS38_15" data-id="PS38_15">For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS38_16" data-id="PS38_16">For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS38_17" data-id="PS38_17">For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS38_18" data-id="PS38_18">For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS38_19" data-id="PS38_19">But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS38_20" data-id="PS38_20">They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS38_21" data-id="PS38_21">Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS38_22" data-id="PS38_22">Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.</span>
