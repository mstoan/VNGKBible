<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_2" data-id="JB6_2">Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_3" data-id="JB6_3">For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_4" data-id="JB6_4">For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_5" data-id="JB6_5">Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_6" data-id="JB6_6">Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_7" data-id="JB6_7">The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_8" data-id="JB6_8">Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_9" data-id="JB6_9">Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_10" data-id="JB6_10">Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_11" data-id="JB6_11">What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_12" data-id="JB6_12">Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_13" data-id="JB6_13">Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_14" data-id="JB6_14">To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_15" data-id="JB6_15">My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_16" data-id="JB6_16">Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_17" data-id="JB6_17">What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_18" data-id="JB6_18">The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_19" data-id="JB6_19">The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_20" data-id="JB6_20">They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_21" data-id="JB6_21">For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_22" data-id="JB6_22">Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_23" data-id="JB6_23">Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_24" data-id="JB6_24">Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_25" data-id="JB6_25">How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_26" data-id="JB6_26">Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_27" data-id="JB6_27">Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_28" data-id="JB6_28">Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB6_29" data-id="JB6_29">Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.</span>
