<div class="mt">2 Samuel</div><div class="c">1</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_1" data-id="S21_1">Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_2" data-id="S21_2">It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_3" data-id="S21_3">And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_4" data-id="S21_4">And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_5" data-id="S21_5">And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_6" data-id="S21_6">And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_7" data-id="S21_7">And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_8" data-id="S21_8">And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_9" data-id="S21_9">And he said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_10" data-id="S21_10">So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_11" data-id="S21_11">Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_12" data-id="S21_12">And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_13" data-id="S21_13">And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_14" data-id="S21_14">And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_15" data-id="S21_15">And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_16" data-id="S21_16">And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_17" data-id="S21_17">And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_18" data-id="S21_18">(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_19" data-id="S21_19">The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_20" data-id="S21_20">Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_21" data-id="S21_21">Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_22" data-id="S21_22">From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_23" data-id="S21_23">Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_24" data-id="S21_24">Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_25" data-id="S21_25">How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou was slain in thine high places.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_26" data-id="S21_26">I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_27" data-id="S21_27">How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</span>
