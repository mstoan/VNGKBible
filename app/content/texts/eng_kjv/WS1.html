<div class="mt">Wisdom</div><div class="c">1</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS1_1" data-id="WS1_1">Love righteousness, ye that be judges of the earth: think of the Lord with a good (heart,) and in simplicity of heart seek him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS1_2" data-id="WS1_2">For he will be found of them that tempt him not; and sheweth himself unto such as do not distrust him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS1_3" data-id="WS1_3">For froward thoughts separate from God: and his power, when it is tried, reproveth the unwise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS1_4" data-id="WS1_4">For into a malicious soul wisdom shall not enter; nor dwell in the body that is subject unto sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS1_5" data-id="WS1_5">For the holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit, and remove from thoughts that are without understanding, and will not abide when unrighteousness cometh in.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS1_6" data-id="WS1_6">For wisdom is a loving spirit; and will not acquit a blasphemer of his words: for God is witness of his reins, and a true beholder of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS1_7" data-id="WS1_7">For the Spirit of the Lord filleth the world: and that which containeth all things hath knowledge of the voice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS1_8" data-id="WS1_8">Therefore he that speaketh unrighteous things cannot be hid: neither shall vengeance, when it punisheth, pass by him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS1_9" data-id="WS1_9">For inquisition shall be made into the counsels of the ungodly: and the sound of his words shall come unto the Lord for the manifestation of his wicked deeds.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS1_10" data-id="WS1_10">For the ear of jealousy heareth all things: and the noise of murmurings is not hid.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS1_11" data-id="WS1_11">Therefore beware of murmuring, which is unprofitable; and refrain your tongue from backbiting: for there is no word so secret, that shall go for nought: and the mouth that belieth slayeth the soul.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS1_12" data-id="WS1_12">Seek not death in the error of your life: and pull not upon yourselves destruction with the works of your hands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS1_13" data-id="WS1_13">For God made not death: neither hath he pleasure in the destruction of the living.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS1_14" data-id="WS1_14">For he created all things, that they might have their being: and the generations of the world were healthful; and there is no poison of destruction in them, nor the kingdom of death upon the earth:</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS1_15" data-id="WS1_15">(For righteousness is immortal:)</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS1_16" data-id="WS1_16">But ungodly men with their works and words called it to them: for when they thought to have it their friend, they consumed to nought, and made a covenant with it, because they are worthy to take part with it.</span>
