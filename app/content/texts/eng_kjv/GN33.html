<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_2" data-id="GN33_2">And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_3" data-id="GN33_3">And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_4" data-id="GN33_4">And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_5" data-id="GN33_5">And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.</span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_8" data-id="GN33_8">And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_9" data-id="GN33_9">And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_10" data-id="GN33_10">And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_11" data-id="GN33_11">Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_14" data-id="GN33_14">Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN33_15" data-id="GN33_15">And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.</span>
