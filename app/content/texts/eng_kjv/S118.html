<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S118_3" data-id="S118_3">Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S118_4" data-id="S118_4">And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.</span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S118_13" data-id="S118_13">Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S118_14" data-id="S118_14">And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.</span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v S118_18" data-id="S118_18">And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?</span>
