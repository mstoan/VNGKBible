<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT17_9" data-id="DT17_9">And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days, and inquire; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment:</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT17_17" data-id="DT17_17">Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT17_18" data-id="DT17_18">And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites:</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT17_19" data-id="DT17_19">And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them:</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT17_20" data-id="DT17_20">That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.</span>
