<div class="c">13</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE13_1" data-id="AE13_1">The copy of the letters was this: The great king Artexerxes writeth these things to the princes and governours that are under him from India unto Ethiopia in an hundred and seven and twenty provinces.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE13_2" data-id="AE13_2">After that I became lord over many nations and had dominion over the whole world, not lifted up with presumption of my authority, but carrying myself always with equity and mildness, I purposed to settle my subjects continually in a quiet life, and making my kingdom peaceable, and open for passage to the utmost coasts, to renew peace, which is desired of all men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE13_3" data-id="AE13_3">Now when I asked my counsellors how this might be brought to pass, Aman, that excelled in wisdom among us, and was approved for his constant good will and steadfast fidelity, and had the honour of the second place in the kingdom,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE13_4" data-id="AE13_4">Declared unto us, that in all nations throughout the world there was scattered a certain malicious people, that had laws contrary to ail nations, and continually despised the commandments of kings, so as the uniting of our kingdoms, honourably intended by us cannot go forward.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE13_5" data-id="AE13_5">Seeing then we understand that this people alone is continually in opposition unto all men, differing in the strange manner of their laws, and evil affected to our state, working all the mischief they can that our kingdom may not be firmly established:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE13_6" data-id="AE13_6">Therefore have we commanded, that all they that are signified in writing unto you by Aman, who is ordained over the affairs, and is next unto us, shall all, with their wives and children, be utterly destroyed by the sword of their enemies, without all mercy and pity, the fourteenth day of the twelfth month Adar of this present year:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE13_7" data-id="AE13_7">That they, who of old and now also are malicious, may in one day with violence go into the grave, and so ever hereafter cause our affairs to be well settled, and without trouble.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE3_14" data-id="AE3_14">The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE3_15" data-id="AE3_15">The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.</span>
