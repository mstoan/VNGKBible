<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_39" data-id="LK4_39">And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_40" data-id="LK4_40">Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_41" data-id="LK4_41">And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.</span>
