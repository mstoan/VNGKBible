<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_2" data-id="JM4_2">Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_3" data-id="JM4_3">Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_4" data-id="JM4_4">Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_5" data-id="JM4_5">Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_6" data-id="JM4_6">But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_7" data-id="JM4_7">Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_8" data-id="JM4_8">Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_9" data-id="JM4_9">Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_10" data-id="JM4_10">Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_11" data-id="JM4_11">Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_12" data-id="JM4_12">There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_13" data-id="JM4_13">Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_14" data-id="JM4_14">Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_15" data-id="JM4_15">For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_16" data-id="JM4_16">But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_17" data-id="JM4_17">Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.</span>
