<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_3" data-id="T21_3">I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_4" data-id="T21_4">Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_5" data-id="T21_5">When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_6" data-id="T21_6">Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_7" data-id="T21_7">For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_8" data-id="T21_8">Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;</span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_11" data-id="T21_11">Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_12" data-id="T21_12">For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_13" data-id="T21_13">Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_16" data-id="T21_16">The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_17" data-id="T21_17">But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_18" data-id="T21_18">The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</span>
