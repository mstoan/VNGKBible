<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH2_2" data-id="JH2_2">And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH2_3" data-id="JH2_3">For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH2_4" data-id="JH2_4">Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.</span>
