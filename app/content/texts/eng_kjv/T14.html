<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_2" data-id="T14_2">Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_3" data-id="T14_3">Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_4" data-id="T14_4">For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_5" data-id="T14_5">For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_6" data-id="T14_6">If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_7" data-id="T14_7">But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_8" data-id="T14_8">For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_9" data-id="T14_9">This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_10" data-id="T14_10">For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_11" data-id="T14_11">These things command and teach.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_12" data-id="T14_12">Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_13" data-id="T14_13">Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_14" data-id="T14_14">Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_15" data-id="T14_15">Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_16" data-id="T14_16">Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.</span>
