<div class="c">6</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_1" data-id="RM6_1">What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_2" data-id="RM6_2">God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_3" data-id="RM6_3">Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_4" data-id="RM6_4">Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_5" data-id="RM6_5">For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_6" data-id="RM6_6">Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_7" data-id="RM6_7">For he that is dead is freed from sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_8" data-id="RM6_8">Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_9" data-id="RM6_9">Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_10" data-id="RM6_10">For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_11" data-id="RM6_11">Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_12" data-id="RM6_12">Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_13" data-id="RM6_13">Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_14" data-id="RM6_14">For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_15" data-id="RM6_15">What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_16" data-id="RM6_16">Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_17" data-id="RM6_17">But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_18" data-id="RM6_18">Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_19" data-id="RM6_19">I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_20" data-id="RM6_20">For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_21" data-id="RM6_21">What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_22" data-id="RM6_22">But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_23" data-id="RM6_23">For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span>
