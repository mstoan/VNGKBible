<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS18_36" data-id="PS18_36">Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS18_37" data-id="PS18_37">I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS18_38" data-id="PS18_38">I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS18_39" data-id="PS18_39">For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS18_40" data-id="PS18_40">Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.</span>
