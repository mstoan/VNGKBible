<div class="c">15</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_1" data-id="MT15_1">Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_2" data-id="MT15_2">Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_3" data-id="MT15_3">But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_4" data-id="MT15_4">For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_5" data-id="MT15_5">But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_6" data-id="MT15_6">And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_7" data-id="MT15_7">Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_8" data-id="MT15_8">This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_9" data-id="MT15_9">But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_10" data-id="MT15_10">And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_11" data-id="MT15_11">Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_12" data-id="MT15_12">Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_13" data-id="MT15_13">But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_14" data-id="MT15_14">Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_15" data-id="MT15_15">Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_16" data-id="MT15_16">And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_17" data-id="MT15_17">Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_18" data-id="MT15_18">But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_19" data-id="MT15_19">For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_20" data-id="MT15_20">These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_21" data-id="MT15_21">Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_22" data-id="MT15_22">And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_23" data-id="MT15_23">But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_24" data-id="MT15_24">But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_25" data-id="MT15_25">Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_26" data-id="MT15_26">But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_27" data-id="MT15_27">And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_28" data-id="MT15_28">Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_29" data-id="MT15_29">And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_30" data-id="MT15_30">And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_31" data-id="MT15_31">Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_32" data-id="MT15_32">Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_33" data-id="MT15_33">And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_34" data-id="MT15_34">And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_35" data-id="MT15_35">And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_36" data-id="MT15_36">And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_37" data-id="MT15_37">And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_38" data-id="MT15_38">And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_39" data-id="MT15_39">And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala,</span>
