<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_2" data-id="GN12_2">And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_3" data-id="GN12_3">And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_4" data-id="GN12_4">So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_5" data-id="GN12_5">And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_6" data-id="GN12_6">And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_7" data-id="GN12_7">And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_8" data-id="GN12_8">And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_9" data-id="GN12_9">And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_10" data-id="GN12_10">And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_11" data-id="GN12_11">And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_12" data-id="GN12_12">Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_13" data-id="GN12_13">Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_14" data-id="GN12_14">And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_15" data-id="GN12_15">The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_16" data-id="GN12_16">And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_17" data-id="GN12_17">And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_18" data-id="GN12_18">And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_19" data-id="GN12_19">Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN12_20" data-id="GN12_20">And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.</span>
