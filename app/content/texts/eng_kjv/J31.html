<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_2" data-id="J31_2">Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_3" data-id="J31_3">For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_4" data-id="J31_4">I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_5" data-id="J31_5">Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_6" data-id="J31_6">Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_7" data-id="J31_7">Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_8" data-id="J31_8">We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_9" data-id="J31_9">I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_10" data-id="J31_10">Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_11" data-id="J31_11">Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_12" data-id="J31_12">Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_13" data-id="J31_13">I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_14" data-id="J31_14">But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_15" data-id="J31_15">But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.</span>
