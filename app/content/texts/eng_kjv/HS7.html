<div class="c">7</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_1" data-id="HS7_1">When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_2" data-id="HS7_2">And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_3" data-id="HS7_3">They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_4" data-id="HS7_4">They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneeded the dough, until it be leavened.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_5" data-id="HS7_5">In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_6" data-id="HS7_6">For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_7" data-id="HS7_7">They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_8" data-id="HS7_8">Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_9" data-id="HS7_9">Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_10" data-id="HS7_10">And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_11" data-id="HS7_11">Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_12" data-id="HS7_12">When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_13" data-id="HS7_13">Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_14" data-id="HS7_14">And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, and they rebel against me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_15" data-id="HS7_15">Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_16" data-id="HS7_16">They return, but not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.</span>
