<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_2" data-id="MC6_2">Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD's controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_3" data-id="MC6_3">O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_4" data-id="MC6_4">For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_5" data-id="MC6_5">O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_6" data-id="MC6_6">Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_7" data-id="MC6_7">Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_8" data-id="MC6_8">He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_9" data-id="MC6_9">The LORD's voice crieth unto the city, and the man of wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_10" data-id="MC6_10">Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable?</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_11" data-id="MC6_11">Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_12" data-id="MC6_12">For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_13" data-id="MC6_13">Therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee, in making thee desolate because of thy sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_14" data-id="MC6_14">Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down shall be in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and that which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_15" data-id="MC6_15">Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_16" data-id="MC6_16">For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.</span>
