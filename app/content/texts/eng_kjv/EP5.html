<div class="c">5</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_1" data-id="EP5_1">Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_2" data-id="EP5_2">And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_3" data-id="EP5_3">But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_4" data-id="EP5_4">Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_5" data-id="EP5_5">For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_6" data-id="EP5_6">Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_7" data-id="EP5_7">Be not ye therefore partakers with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_8" data-id="EP5_8">For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_9" data-id="EP5_9">(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_10" data-id="EP5_10">Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_11" data-id="EP5_11">And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_12" data-id="EP5_12">For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_13" data-id="EP5_13">But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_14" data-id="EP5_14">Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_15" data-id="EP5_15">See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_16" data-id="EP5_16">Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_17" data-id="EP5_17">Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_18" data-id="EP5_18">And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_19" data-id="EP5_19">Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_20" data-id="EP5_20">Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_21" data-id="EP5_21">Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_22" data-id="EP5_22">Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_23" data-id="EP5_23">For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_24" data-id="EP5_24">Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_25" data-id="EP5_25">Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_26" data-id="EP5_26">That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_27" data-id="EP5_27">That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_28" data-id="EP5_28">So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_29" data-id="EP5_29">For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_30" data-id="EP5_30">For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_31" data-id="EP5_31">For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_32" data-id="EP5_32">This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_33" data-id="EP5_33">Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.</span>
