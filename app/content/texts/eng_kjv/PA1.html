<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_2" data-id="PA1_2">Then Azarias stood up, and prayed on this manner; and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_3" data-id="PA1_3">Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: thy name is worthy to be praised and glorified for evermore:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_4" data-id="PA1_4">For thou art righteous in all the things that thou hast done to us: yea, true are all thy works, thy ways are right, and all thy judgments truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_5" data-id="PA1_5">In all the things that thou hast brought upon us, and upon the holy city of our fathers, even Jerusalem, thou hast executed true judgment: for according to truth and judgment didst thou bring all these things upon us because of our sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_6" data-id="PA1_6">For we have sinned and committed iniquity, departing from thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_7" data-id="PA1_7">In all things have we trespassed, and not obeyed thy commandments, nor kept them, neither done as thou hast commanded us, that it might go well with us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_8" data-id="PA1_8">Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us, and every thing that thou hast done to us, thou hast done in true judgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_9" data-id="PA1_9">And thou didst deliver us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful forsakers of God, and to an unjust king, and the most wicked in all the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_10" data-id="PA1_10">And now we cannot open our mouths, we are become a shame and reproach to thy servants; and to them that worship thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_11" data-id="PA1_11">Yet deliver us not up wholly, for thy name's sake, neither disannul thou thy covenant:</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_12" data-id="PA1_12">And cause not thy mercy to depart from us, for thy beloved Abraham's sake, for thy servant Issac's sake, and for thy holy Israel's sake;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_13" data-id="PA1_13">To whom thou hast spoken and promised, that thou wouldest multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that lieth upon the seashore.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_14" data-id="PA1_14">For we, O Lord, are become less than any nation, and be kept under this day in all the world because of our sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_15" data-id="PA1_15">Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place to sacrifice before thee, and to find mercy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_16" data-id="PA1_16">Nevertheless in a contrite heart and an humble spirit let us be accepted.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_17" data-id="PA1_17">Like as in the burnt offerings of rams and bullocks, and like as in ten thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be in thy sight this day, and grant that we may wholly go after thee: for they shall not be confounded that put their trust in thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_18" data-id="PA1_18">And now we follow thee with all our heart, we fear thee, and seek thy face.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_19" data-id="PA1_19">Put us not to shame: but deal with us after thy lovingkindness, and according to the multitude of thy mercies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_20" data-id="PA1_20">Deliver us also according to thy marvellous works, and give glory to thy name, O Lord: and let all them that do thy servants hurt be ashamed;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_21" data-id="PA1_21">And let them be confounded in all their power and might, and let their strength be broken;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_22" data-id="PA1_22">And let them know that thou art God, the only God, and glorious over the whole world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_23" data-id="PA1_23">And the king's servants, that put them in, ceased not to make the oven hot with rosin, pitch, tow, and small wood;</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_24" data-id="PA1_24">So that the flame streamed forth above the furnace forty and nine cubits.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_25" data-id="PA1_25">And it passed through, and burned those Chaldeans it found about the furnace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_26" data-id="PA1_26">But the angel of the Lord came down into the oven together with Azarias and his fellows, and smote the flame of the fire out of the oven;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_27" data-id="PA1_27">And made the midst of the furnace as it had been a moist whistling wind, so that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurt nor troubled them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_28" data-id="PA1_28">Then the three, as out of one mouth, praised, glorified, and blessed, God in the furnace, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v PA1_29" data-id="PA1_29">Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.</span>
