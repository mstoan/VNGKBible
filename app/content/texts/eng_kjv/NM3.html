<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM3_6" data-id="NM3_6">And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM3_7" data-id="NM3_7">And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM3_8" data-id="NM3_8">Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was from the sea?</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM3_9" data-id="NM3_9">Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM3_10" data-id="NM3_10">Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM3_16" data-id="NM3_16">Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and flieth away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM3_17" data-id="NM3_17">Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy captains as the great grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they are.</span>
