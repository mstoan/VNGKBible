<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB23_2" data-id="JB23_2">Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB23_3" data-id="JB23_3">Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB23_4" data-id="JB23_4">I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB23_5" data-id="JB23_5">I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB23_6" data-id="JB23_6">Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB23_7" data-id="JB23_7">There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB23_8" data-id="JB23_8">Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB23_9" data-id="JB23_9">On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB23_10" data-id="JB23_10">But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB23_11" data-id="JB23_11">My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB23_12" data-id="JB23_12">Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB23_13" data-id="JB23_13">But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB23_14" data-id="JB23_14">For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.</span>
