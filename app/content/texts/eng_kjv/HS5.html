<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_2" data-id="HS5_2">And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I have been a rebuker of them all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_3" data-id="HS5_3">I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, and Israel is defiled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_4" data-id="HS5_4">They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_5" data-id="HS5_5">And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_6" data-id="HS5_6">They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn himself from them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_7" data-id="HS5_7">They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_8" data-id="HS5_8">Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud at Beth-aven, after thee, O Benjamin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_9" data-id="HS5_9">Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_10" data-id="HS5_10">The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_11" data-id="HS5_11">Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_12" data-id="HS5_12">Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_13" data-id="HS5_13">When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_14" data-id="HS5_14">For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_15" data-id="HS5_15">I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.</span>
