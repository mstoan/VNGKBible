<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX40_7" data-id="EX40_7">And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX40_8" data-id="EX40_8">And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX40_9" data-id="EX40_9">And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.</span>

<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX40_20" data-id="EX40_20">And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX40_21" data-id="EX40_21">And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX40_22" data-id="EX40_22">And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX40_23" data-id="EX40_23">And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX40_24" data-id="EX40_24">And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX40_25" data-id="EX40_25">And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX40_26" data-id="EX40_26">And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail:</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX40_27" data-id="EX40_27">And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX40_28" data-id="EX40_28">And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX40_29" data-id="EX40_29">And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX40_30" data-id="EX40_30">And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX40_31" data-id="EX40_31">And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX40_32" data-id="EX40_32">When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX40_33" data-id="EX40_33">And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX40_34" data-id="EX40_34">Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX40_35" data-id="EX40_35">And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX40_36" data-id="EX40_36">And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX40_37" data-id="EX40_37">But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX40_38" data-id="EX40_38">For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.</span>
