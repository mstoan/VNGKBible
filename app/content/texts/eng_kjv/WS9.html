<div class="c">9</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS9_1" data-id="WS9_1">O God of my fathers, and Lord of mercy, who hast made all things with thy word,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS9_2" data-id="WS9_2">And ordained man through thy wisdom, that he should have dominion over the creatures which thou hast made,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS9_3" data-id="WS9_3">And order the world according to equity and righteousness, and execute judgment with an upright heart:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS9_4" data-id="WS9_4">Give me wisdom, that sitteth by thy throne; and reject me not from among thy children:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS9_5" data-id="WS9_5">For I thy servant and son of thine handmaid am a feeble person, and of a short time, and too young for the understanding of judgment and laws.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS9_6" data-id="WS9_6">For though a man be never so perfect among the children of men, yet if thy wisdom be not with him, he shall be nothing regarded.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS9_7" data-id="WS9_7">Thou hast chosen me to be a king of thy people, and a judge of thy sons and daughters:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS9_8" data-id="WS9_8">Thou hast commanded me to build a temple upon thy holy mount, and an altar in the city wherein thou dwellest, a resemblance of the holy tabernacle, which thou hast prepared from the beginning.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS9_9" data-id="WS9_9">And wisdom was with thee: which knoweth thy works, and was present when thou madest the world, and knew what was acceptable in thy sight, and right in thy commandments.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS9_10" data-id="WS9_10">O send her out of thy holy heavens, and from the throne of thy glory, that being present she may labour with me, that I may know what is pleasing unto thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS9_11" data-id="WS9_11">For she knoweth and understandeth all things, and she shall lead me soberly in my doings, and preserve me in her power.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS9_12" data-id="WS9_12">So shall my works be acceptable, and then shall I judge thy people righteously, and be worthy to sit in my father's seat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS9_13" data-id="WS9_13">For what man is he that can know the counsel of God? or who can think what the will of the Lord is?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS9_14" data-id="WS9_14">For the thoughts of mortal men are miserable, and our devices are but uncertain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS9_15" data-id="WS9_15">For the corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthy tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS9_16" data-id="WS9_16">And hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon earth, and with labour do we find the things that are before us: but the things that are in heaven who hath searched out?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS9_17" data-id="WS9_17">And thy counsel who hath known, except thou give wisdom, and send thy Holy Spirit from above?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS9_18" data-id="WS9_18">For so the ways of them which lived on the earth were reformed, and men were taught the things that are pleasing unto thee, and were saved through wisdom.</span>
