<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R120_2" data-id="R120_2">And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R120_3" data-id="R120_3">And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes.
