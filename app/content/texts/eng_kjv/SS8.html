<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS8_6" data-id="SS8_6">Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS8_7" data-id="SS8_7">Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.</span>
