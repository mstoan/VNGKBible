<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_6" data-id="JR6_6">For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_7" data-id="JR6_7">As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually is grief and wounds.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_8" data-id="JR6_8">Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_9" data-id="JR6_9">Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall throughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_10" data-id="JR6_10">To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_11" data-id="JR6_11">Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_12" data-id="JR6_12">And their houses shall be turned unto others, with their fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_13" data-id="JR6_13">For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.</span>

<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_19" data-id="JR6_19">Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_20" data-id="JR6_20">To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.</span>

<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_23" data-id="JR6_23">They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_24" data-id="JR6_24">We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail.</span>
