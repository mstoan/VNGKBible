<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS69_3" data-id="PS69_3">I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS69_4" data-id="PS69_4">They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS69_5" data-id="PS69_5">O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS69_6" data-id="PS69_6">Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.</span>

<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS69_23" data-id="PS69_23">Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS69_24" data-id="PS69_24">Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS69_25" data-id="PS69_25">Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS69_26" data-id="PS69_26">For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS69_27" data-id="PS69_27">Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.</span>
