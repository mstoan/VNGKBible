<div class="mt">Galatians</div><div class="c">1</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_1" data-id="GL1_1">Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_2" data-id="GL1_2">And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_3" data-id="GL1_3">Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_4" data-id="GL1_4">Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_5" data-id="GL1_5">To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_6" data-id="GL1_6">I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_7" data-id="GL1_7">Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_8" data-id="GL1_8">But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_9" data-id="GL1_9">As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_10" data-id="GL1_10">For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_11" data-id="GL1_11">But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_12" data-id="GL1_12">For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_13" data-id="GL1_13">For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_14" data-id="GL1_14">And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_15" data-id="GL1_15">But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_16" data-id="GL1_16">To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_17" data-id="GL1_17">Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_18" data-id="GL1_18">Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_19" data-id="GL1_19">But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_20" data-id="GL1_20">Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_21" data-id="GL1_21">Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_22" data-id="GL1_22">And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_23" data-id="GL1_23">But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_24" data-id="GL1_24">And they glorified God in me.</span>
