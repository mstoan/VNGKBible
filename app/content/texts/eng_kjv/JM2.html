<div class="c">2</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_1" data-id="JM2_1">My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_2" data-id="JM2_2">For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_3" data-id="JM2_3">And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_4" data-id="JM2_4">Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_5" data-id="JM2_5">Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_6" data-id="JM2_6">But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_7" data-id="JM2_7">Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_8" data-id="JM2_8">If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_9" data-id="JM2_9">But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_10" data-id="JM2_10">For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_11" data-id="JM2_11">For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_12" data-id="JM2_12">So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_13" data-id="JM2_13">For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_14" data-id="JM2_14">What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_15" data-id="JM2_15">If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_16" data-id="JM2_16">And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_17" data-id="JM2_17">Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_18" data-id="JM2_18">Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_19" data-id="JM2_19">Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_20" data-id="JM2_20">But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_21" data-id="JM2_21">Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_22" data-id="JM2_22">Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_23" data-id="JM2_23">And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_24" data-id="JM2_24">Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_25" data-id="JM2_25">Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_26" data-id="JM2_26">For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</span>
