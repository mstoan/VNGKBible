<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_2" data-id="JN17_2">As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_3" data-id="JN17_3">And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_4" data-id="JN17_4">I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_5" data-id="JN17_5">And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_6" data-id="JN17_6">I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_7" data-id="JN17_7">Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_8" data-id="JN17_8">For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_9" data-id="JN17_9">I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_10" data-id="JN17_10">And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_11" data-id="JN17_11">And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_12" data-id="JN17_12">While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_13" data-id="JN17_13">And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_14" data-id="JN17_14">I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_15" data-id="JN17_15">I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_16" data-id="JN17_16">They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_17" data-id="JN17_17">Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_18" data-id="JN17_18">As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_19" data-id="JN17_19">And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_20" data-id="JN17_20">Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_21" data-id="JN17_21">That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_22" data-id="JN17_22">And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_23" data-id="JN17_23">I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_24" data-id="JN17_24">Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_25" data-id="JN17_25">O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_26" data-id="JN17_26">And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.</span>
