<div class="c">4</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH4_1" data-id="JH4_1">But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH4_2" data-id="JH4_2">And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH4_3" data-id="JH4_3">Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH4_4" data-id="JH4_4">Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH4_5" data-id="JH4_5">So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH4_6" data-id="JH4_6">And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH4_7" data-id="JH4_7">But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH4_8" data-id="JH4_8">And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH4_9" data-id="JH4_9">And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH4_10" data-id="JH4_10">Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH4_11" data-id="JH4_11">And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?</span>
