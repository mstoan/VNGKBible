<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR17_2" data-id="JR17_2">Whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills.</span>

<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR17_6" data-id="JR17_6">For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR17_7" data-id="JR17_7">Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR17_8" data-id="JR17_8">For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR17_9" data-id="JR17_9">The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?</span>

<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR17_23" data-id="JR17_23">But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR17_24" data-id="JR17_24">And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein;</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR17_25" data-id="JR17_25">Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR17_26" data-id="JR17_26">And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR17_27" data-id="JR17_27">But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.</span>
