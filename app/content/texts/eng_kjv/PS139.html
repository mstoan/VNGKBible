<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS139_3" data-id="PS139_3">Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS139_4" data-id="PS139_4">For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.</span>
