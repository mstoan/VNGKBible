<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_7" data-id="S223_7">But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_8" data-id="S223_8">These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_9" data-id="S223_9">And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_17" data-id="S223_17">And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.</span>
