<div class="c">3</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_1" data-id="HB3_1">Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_2" data-id="HB3_2">Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_3" data-id="HB3_3">For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_4" data-id="HB3_4">For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_5" data-id="HB3_5">And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_6" data-id="HB3_6">But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_7" data-id="HB3_7">Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_8" data-id="HB3_8">Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_9" data-id="HB3_9">When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_10" data-id="HB3_10">Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_11" data-id="HB3_11">So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_12" data-id="HB3_12">Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_13" data-id="HB3_13">But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_14" data-id="HB3_14">For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_15" data-id="HB3_15">While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_16" data-id="HB3_16">For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_17" data-id="HB3_17">But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_18" data-id="HB3_18">And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_19" data-id="HB3_19">So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</span>
