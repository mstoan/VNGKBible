<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_2" data-id="TT3_2">To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_3" data-id="TT3_3">For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_4" data-id="TT3_4">But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_5" data-id="TT3_5">Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_6" data-id="TT3_6">Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_7" data-id="TT3_7">That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_8" data-id="TT3_8">This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_9" data-id="TT3_9">But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_10" data-id="TT3_10">A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_11" data-id="TT3_11">Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_12" data-id="TT3_12">When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_13" data-id="TT3_13">Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_14" data-id="TT3_14">And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</span>
