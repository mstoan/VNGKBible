<div class="c">7</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_1" data-id="SS7_1">How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_2" data-id="SS7_2">Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_3" data-id="SS7_3">Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_4" data-id="SS7_4">Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_5" data-id="SS7_5">Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king is held in the galleries.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_6" data-id="SS7_6">How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_7" data-id="SS7_7">This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_8" data-id="SS7_8">I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_9" data-id="SS7_9">And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_10" data-id="SS7_10">I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_11" data-id="SS7_11">Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_12" data-id="SS7_12">Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_13" data-id="SS7_13">The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.</span>
