<div class="c">24</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_1" data-id="LK24_1">Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_2" data-id="LK24_2">And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_3" data-id="LK24_3">And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_4" data-id="LK24_4">And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_5" data-id="LK24_5">And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_6" data-id="LK24_6">He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_7" data-id="LK24_7">Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_8" data-id="LK24_8">And they remembered his words,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_9" data-id="LK24_9">And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_10" data-id="LK24_10">It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_11" data-id="LK24_11">And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_12" data-id="LK24_12">Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_13" data-id="LK24_13">And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_14" data-id="LK24_14">And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_15" data-id="LK24_15">And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_16" data-id="LK24_16">But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_17" data-id="LK24_17">And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_18" data-id="LK24_18">And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass therein these days?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_19" data-id="LK24_19">And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_20" data-id="LK24_20">And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_21" data-id="LK24_21">But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_22" data-id="LK24_22">Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_23" data-id="LK24_23">And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_24" data-id="LK24_24">And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_25" data-id="LK24_25">Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_26" data-id="LK24_26">Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_27" data-id="LK24_27">And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_28" data-id="LK24_28">And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_29" data-id="LK24_29">But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_30" data-id="LK24_30">And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_31" data-id="LK24_31">And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_32" data-id="LK24_32">And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_33" data-id="LK24_33">And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_34" data-id="LK24_34">Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_35" data-id="LK24_35">And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_36" data-id="LK24_36">And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_37" data-id="LK24_37">But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_38" data-id="LK24_38">And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_39" data-id="LK24_39">Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_40" data-id="LK24_40">And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_41" data-id="LK24_41">And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_42" data-id="LK24_42">And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_43" data-id="LK24_43">And he took it, and did eat before them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_44" data-id="LK24_44">And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_45" data-id="LK24_45">Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_46" data-id="LK24_46">And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_47" data-id="LK24_47">And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_48" data-id="LK24_48">And ye are witnesses of these things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_49" data-id="LK24_49">And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_50" data-id="LK24_50">And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_51" data-id="LK24_51">And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_52" data-id="LK24_52">And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_53" data-id="LK24_53">And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</span>
