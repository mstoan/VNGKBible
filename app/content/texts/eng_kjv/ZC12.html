<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_2" data-id="ZC12_2">Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_3" data-id="ZC12_3">And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_4" data-id="ZC12_4">In that day, saith the LORD, I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with blindness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_5" data-id="ZC12_5">And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the LORD of hosts their God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_6" data-id="ZC12_6">In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right hand and on the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, even in Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_7" data-id="ZC12_7">The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_8" data-id="ZC12_8">In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of the LORD before them.</span>
