<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR24_26" data-id="SR24_26">He maketh the understanding to abound like Euphrates, and as Jordan in the time of the harvest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR24_27" data-id="SR24_27">He maketh the doctrine of knowledge appear as the light, and as Geon in the time of vintage.</span>

<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR24_29" data-id="SR24_29">For her thoughts are more than the sea, and her counsels profounder than the great deep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR24_30" data-id="SR24_30">I also came out as a brook from a river, and as a conduit into a garden.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR24_31" data-id="SR24_31">I said, I will water my best garden, and will water abundantly my garden bed: and, lo, my brook became a river, and my river became a sea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR24_32" data-id="SR24_32">I will yet make doctrine to shine as the morning, and will send forth her light afar off.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR24_33" data-id="SR24_33">I will yet pour out doctrine as prophecy, and leave it to all ages for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR24_34" data-id="SR24_34">Behold that I have not laboured for myself only, but for all them that seek wisdom.</span>
