<div class="c">2</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_1" data-id="M22_1">It is also found in the records, that Jeremy the prophet commanded them that were carried away to take of the fire, as it hath been signified:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_2" data-id="M22_2">And how that the prophet, having given them the law, charged them not to forget the commandments of the Lord, and that they should not err in their minds, when they see images of silver and gold, with their ornaments.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_3" data-id="M22_3">And with other such speeches exhorted he them, that the law should not depart from their hearts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_4" data-id="M22_4">It was also contained in the same writing, that the prophet, being warned of God, commanded the tabernacle and the ark to go with him, as he went forth into the mountain, where Moses climbed up, and saw the heritage of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_5" data-id="M22_5">And when Jeremy came thither, he found an hollow cave, wherein he laid the tabernacle, and the ark, and the altar of incense, and so stopped the door.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_6" data-id="M22_6">And some of those that followed him came to mark the way, but they could not find it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_7" data-id="M22_7">Which when Jeremy perceived, he blamed them, saying, As for that place, it shall be unknown until the time that God gather his people again together, and receive them unto mercy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_8" data-id="M22_8">Then shall the Lord shew them these things, and the glory of the Lord shall appear, and the cloud also, as it was shewed under Moses, and as when Solomon desired that the place might be honourably sanctified.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_9" data-id="M22_9">It was also declared, that he being wise offered the sacrifice of dedication, and of the finishing of the temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_10" data-id="M22_10">And as when Moses prayed unto the Lord, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the sacrifices: even so prayed Solomon also, and the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offerings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_11" data-id="M22_11">And Moses said, Because the sin offering was not to be eaten, it was consumed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_12" data-id="M22_12">So Solomon kept those eight days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_13" data-id="M22_13">The same things also were reported in the writings and commentaries of Neemias; and how he founding a library gathered together the acts of the kings, and the prophets, and of David, and the epistles of the kings concerning the holy gifts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_14" data-id="M22_14">In like manner also Judas gathered together all those things that were lost by reason of the war we had, and they remain with us,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_15" data-id="M22_15">Wherefore if ye have need thereof, send some to fetch them unto you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_16" data-id="M22_16">Whereas we then are about to celebrate the purification, we have written unto you, and ye shall do well, if ye keep the same days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_17" data-id="M22_17">We hope also, that the God, that delivered all his people, and gave them all an heritage, and the kingdom, and the priesthood, and the sanctuary,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_18" data-id="M22_18">As he promised in the law, will shortly have mercy upon us, and gather us together out of every land under heaven into the holy place: for he hath delivered us out of great troubles, and hath purified the place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_19" data-id="M22_19">Now as concerning Judas Maccabeus, and his brethren, and the purification of the great temple, and the dedication of the altar,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_20" data-id="M22_20">And the wars against Antiochus Epiphanes, and Eupator his son,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_21" data-id="M22_21">And the manifest signs that came from heaven unto those that behaved themselves manfully to their honour for Judaism: so that, being but a few, they overcame the whole country, and chased barbarous multitudes,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_22" data-id="M22_22">And recovered again the temple renowned all the world over, and freed the city, and upheld the laws which were going down, the Lord being gracious unto them with all favour:</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_23" data-id="M22_23">All these things, I say, being declared by Jason of Cyrene in five books, we will assay to abridge in one volume.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_24" data-id="M22_24">For considering the infinite number, and the difficulty which they find that desire to look into the narrations of the story, for the variety of the matter,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_25" data-id="M22_25">We have been careful, that they that will read may have delight, and that they that are desirous to commit to memory might have ease, and that all into whose hands it comes might have profit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_26" data-id="M22_26">Therefore to us, that have taken upon us this painful labour of abridging, it was not easy, but a matter of sweat and watching;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_27" data-id="M22_27">Even as it is no ease unto him that prepareth a banquet, and seeketh the benefit of others: yet for the pleasuring of many we will undertake gladly this great pains;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_28" data-id="M22_28">Leaving to the author the exact handling of every particular, and labouring to follow the rules of an abridgement.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_29" data-id="M22_29">For as the master builder of a new house must care for the whole building; but he that undertaketh to set it out, and paint it, must seek out fit things for the adorning thereof: even so I think it is with us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_30" data-id="M22_30">To stand upon every point, and go over things at large, and to be curious in particulars, belongeth to the first author of the story:</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_31" data-id="M22_31">But to use brevity, and avoid much labouring of the work, is to be granted to him that will make an abridgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v M22_32" data-id="M22_32">Here then will we begin the story: only adding thus much to that which hath been said, that it is a foolish thing to make a long prologue, and to be short in the story itself.</span>
