<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_3" data-id="K11_3">So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.</span>

<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_29" data-id="K11_29">And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_30" data-id="K11_30">Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_31" data-id="K11_31">Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_32" data-id="K11_32">And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_33" data-id="K11_33">The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_34" data-id="K11_34">And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_35" data-id="K11_35">Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_36" data-id="K11_36">And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_37" data-id="K11_37">As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_38" data-id="K11_38">So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_39" data-id="K11_39">And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.</span>

<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_41" data-id="K11_41">And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_42" data-id="K11_42">And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_43" data-id="K11_43">And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_44" data-id="K11_44">And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_45" data-id="K11_45">And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_46" data-id="K11_46">And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_47" data-id="K11_47">And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_48" data-id="K11_48">And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_49" data-id="K11_49">And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_50" data-id="K11_50">And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_51" data-id="K11_51">And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_52" data-id="K11_52">And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.</span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_53" data-id="K11_53">So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.</span>
