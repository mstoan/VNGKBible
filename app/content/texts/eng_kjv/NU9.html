<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU9_2" data-id="NU9_2">Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU9_3" data-id="NU9_3">In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU9_4" data-id="NU9_4">And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU9_5" data-id="NU9_5">And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU9_6" data-id="NU9_6">And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU9_7" data-id="NU9_7">And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU9_8" data-id="NU9_8">And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU9_9" data-id="NU9_9">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU9_10" data-id="NU9_10">Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU9_11" data-id="NU9_11">The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU9_12" data-id="NU9_12">They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU9_13" data-id="NU9_13">But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU9_14" data-id="NU9_14">And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU9_15" data-id="NU9_15">And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU9_16" data-id="NU9_16">So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU9_17" data-id="NU9_17">And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU9_18" data-id="NU9_18">At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU9_19" data-id="NU9_19">And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU9_20" data-id="NU9_20">And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU9_21" data-id="NU9_21">And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU9_22" data-id="NU9_22">Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU9_23" data-id="NU9_23">At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</span>
