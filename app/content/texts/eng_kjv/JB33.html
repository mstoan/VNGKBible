<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB33_3" data-id="JB33_3">My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB33_4" data-id="JB33_4">The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB33_5" data-id="JB33_5">If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB33_6" data-id="JB33_6">Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB33_7" data-id="JB33_7">Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.</span>

<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB33_28" data-id="JB33_28">He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB33_29" data-id="JB33_29">Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB33_30" data-id="JB33_30">To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.</span>
