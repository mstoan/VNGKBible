<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS45_2" data-id="IS45_2">I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS45_3" data-id="IS45_3">And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the LORD, which call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel.</span>

<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS45_5" data-id="IS45_5">I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS45_6" data-id="IS45_6">That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there is none else.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS45_7" data-id="IS45_7">I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.</span>

<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS45_19" data-id="IS45_19">I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS45_20" data-id="IS45_20">Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS45_21" data-id="IS45_21">Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS45_22" data-id="IS45_22">Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.</span>
