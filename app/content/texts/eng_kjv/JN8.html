<div class="c">8</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_1" data-id="JN8_1">Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_2" data-id="JN8_2">And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_3" data-id="JN8_3">And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_4" data-id="JN8_4">They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_5" data-id="JN8_5">Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_6" data-id="JN8_6">This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_7" data-id="JN8_7">So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_8" data-id="JN8_8">And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_9" data-id="JN8_9">And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_10" data-id="JN8_10">When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_11" data-id="JN8_11">She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_12" data-id="JN8_12">Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_13" data-id="JN8_13">The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_14" data-id="JN8_14">Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_15" data-id="JN8_15">Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_16" data-id="JN8_16">And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_17" data-id="JN8_17">It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_18" data-id="JN8_18">I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_19" data-id="JN8_19">Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_20" data-id="JN8_20">These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_21" data-id="JN8_21">Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_22" data-id="JN8_22">Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_23" data-id="JN8_23">And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_24" data-id="JN8_24">I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_25" data-id="JN8_25">Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_26" data-id="JN8_26">I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_27" data-id="JN8_27">They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_28" data-id="JN8_28">Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_29" data-id="JN8_29">And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_30" data-id="JN8_30">As he spake these words, many believed on him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_31" data-id="JN8_31">Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_32" data-id="JN8_32">And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_33" data-id="JN8_33">They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_34" data-id="JN8_34">Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_35" data-id="JN8_35">And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_36" data-id="JN8_36">If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_37" data-id="JN8_37">I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_38" data-id="JN8_38">I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_39" data-id="JN8_39">They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_40" data-id="JN8_40">But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_41" data-id="JN8_41">Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_42" data-id="JN8_42">Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_43" data-id="JN8_43">Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_44" data-id="JN8_44">Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_45" data-id="JN8_45">And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_46" data-id="JN8_46">Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_47" data-id="JN8_47">He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_48" data-id="JN8_48">Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_49" data-id="JN8_49">Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_50" data-id="JN8_50">And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_51" data-id="JN8_51">Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_52" data-id="JN8_52">Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_53" data-id="JN8_53">Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?</span>
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_54" data-id="JN8_54">Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:</span>
<span class="v-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_55" data-id="JN8_55">Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</span>
<span class="v-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_56" data-id="JN8_56">Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.</span>
<span class="v-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_57" data-id="JN8_57">Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</span>
<span class="v-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_58" data-id="JN8_58">Jesus said unto them, Verily,verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</span>
<span class="v-num v-59">59&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_59" data-id="JN8_59">Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</span>
