<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_2" data-id="IS61_2">To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_3" data-id="IS61_3">To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_4" data-id="IS61_4">And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_5" data-id="IS61_5">And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_6" data-id="IS61_6">But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: men shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_7" data-id="IS61_7">For your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_8" data-id="IS61_8">For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_9" data-id="IS61_9">And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the LORD hath blessed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_10" data-id="IS61_10">I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_11" data-id="IS61_11">For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.</span>
