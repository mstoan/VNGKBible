<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT24_2" data-id="MT24_2">And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.</span>

<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT24_4" data-id="MT24_4">And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT24_5" data-id="MT24_5">For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT24_6" data-id="MT24_6">And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT24_7" data-id="MT24_7">For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT24_12" data-id="MT24_12">And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT24_13" data-id="MT24_13">But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.</span>

<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT24_24" data-id="MT24_24">For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.</span>

<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT24_27" data-id="MT24_27">For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</span>

<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT24_33" data-id="MT24_33">So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT24_34" data-id="MT24_34">Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT24_35" data-id="MT24_35">Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT24_36" data-id="MT24_36">But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT24_37" data-id="MT24_37">But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT24_38" data-id="MT24_38">For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT24_39" data-id="MT24_39">And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</span>

<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT24_44" data-id="MT24_44">Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT24_45" data-id="MT24_45">Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?</span>
