<div class="c">2</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS2_1" data-id="WS2_1">For the ungodly said, reasoning with themselves, but not aright, Our life is short and tedious, and in the death of a man there is no remedy: neither was there any man known to have returned from the grave.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS2_2" data-id="WS2_2">For we are born at all adventure: and we shall be hereafter as though we had never been: for the breath in our nostrils is as smoke, and a little spark in the moving of our heart:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS2_3" data-id="WS2_3">Which being extinguished, our body shall be turned into ashes, and our spirit shall vanish as the soft air,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS2_4" data-id="WS2_4">And our name shall be forgotten in time, and no man shall have our works in remembrance, and our life shall pass away as the trace of a cloud, and shall be dispersed as a mist, that is driven away with the beams of the sun, and overcome with the heat thereof.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS2_5" data-id="WS2_5">For our time is a very shadow that passeth away; and after our end there is no returning: for it is fast sealed, so that no man cometh again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS2_6" data-id="WS2_6">Come on therefore, let us enjoy the good things that are present: and let us speedily use the creatures like as in youth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS2_7" data-id="WS2_7">Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and ointments: and let no flower of the spring pass by us:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS2_8" data-id="WS2_8">Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds, before they be withered:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS2_9" data-id="WS2_9">Let none of us go without his part of our voluptuousness: let us leave tokens of our joyfulness in every place: for this is our portion, and our lot is this.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS2_10" data-id="WS2_10">Let us oppress the poor righteous man, let us not spare the widow, nor reverence the ancient gray hairs of the aged.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS2_11" data-id="WS2_11">Let our strength be the law of justice: for that which is feeble is found to be nothing worth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS2_12" data-id="WS2_12">Therefore let us lie in wait for the righteous; because he is not for our turn, and he is clean contrary to our doings: he upbraideth us with our offending the law, and objecteth to our infamy the transgressings of our education.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS2_13" data-id="WS2_13">He professeth to have the knowledge of God: and he calleth himself the child of the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS2_14" data-id="WS2_14">He was made to reprove our thoughts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS2_15" data-id="WS2_15">He is grievous unto us even to behold: for his life is not like other men's, his ways are of another fashion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS2_16" data-id="WS2_16">We are esteemed of him as counterfeits: he abstaineth from our ways as from filthiness: he pronounceth the end of the just to be blessed, and maketh his boast that God is his father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS2_17" data-id="WS2_17">Let us see if his words be true: and let us prove what shall happen in the end of him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS2_18" data-id="WS2_18">For if the just man be the son of God, he will help him, and deliver him from the hand of his enemies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS2_19" data-id="WS2_19">Let us examine him with despitefulness and torture, that we may know his meekness, and prove his patience.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS2_20" data-id="WS2_20">Let us condemn him with a shameful death: for by his own saying he shall be respected.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS2_21" data-id="WS2_21">Such things they did imagine, and were deceived: for their own wickedness hath blinded them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS2_22" data-id="WS2_22">As for the mysteries of God, they kn ew them not: neither hoped they for the wages of righteousness, nor discerned a reward for blameless souls.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS2_23" data-id="WS2_23">For God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of his own eternity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS2_24" data-id="WS2_24">Nevertheless through envy of the devil came death into the world: and they that do hold of his side do find it.</span>
