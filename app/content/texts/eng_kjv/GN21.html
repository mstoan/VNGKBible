<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_2" data-id="GN21_2">For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_3" data-id="GN21_3">And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_4" data-id="GN21_4">And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.</span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_10" data-id="GN21_10">Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.</span>

<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_23" data-id="GN21_23">Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_24" data-id="GN21_24">And Abraham said, I will swear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_25" data-id="GN21_25">And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.</span>

<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_27" data-id="GN21_27">And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_28" data-id="GN21_28">And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_29" data-id="GN21_29">And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_30" data-id="GN21_30">And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_31" data-id="GN21_31">Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they sware both of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN21_32" data-id="GN21_32">Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.</span>
