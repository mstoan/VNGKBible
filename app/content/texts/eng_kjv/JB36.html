<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB36_3" data-id="JB36_3">I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB36_4" data-id="JB36_4">For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB36_5" data-id="JB36_5">Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB36_6" data-id="JB36_6">He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB36_7" data-id="JB36_7">He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB36_8" data-id="JB36_8">And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB36_9" data-id="JB36_9">Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.</span>
