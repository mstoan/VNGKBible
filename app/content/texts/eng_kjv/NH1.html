<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH1_2" data-id="NH1_2">That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH1_3" data-id="NH1_3">And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH1_4" data-id="NH1_4">And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH1_5" data-id="NH1_5">And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH1_6" data-id="NH1_6">Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH1_7" data-id="NH1_7">We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH1_8" data-id="NH1_8">Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH1_9" data-id="NH1_9">But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH1_10" data-id="NH1_10">Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH1_11" data-id="NH1_11">O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.</span>
