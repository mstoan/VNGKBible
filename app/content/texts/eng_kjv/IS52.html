<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS52_2" data-id="IS52_2">Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS52_3" data-id="IS52_3">For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS52_4" data-id="IS52_4">For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS52_5" data-id="IS52_5">Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every day is blasphemed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS52_6" data-id="IS52_6">Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is I.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS52_7" data-id="IS52_7">How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS52_8" data-id="IS52_8">Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again Zion.</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS52_12" data-id="IS52_12">For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rereward.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS52_13" data-id="IS52_13">Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS52_14" data-id="IS52_14">As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS52_15" data-id="IS52_15">So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.</span>
