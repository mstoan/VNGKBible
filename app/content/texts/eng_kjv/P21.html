<div class="mt">2 Peter</div><div class="c">1</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_1" data-id="P21_1">Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_2" data-id="P21_2">Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_3" data-id="P21_3">According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_4" data-id="P21_4">Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_5" data-id="P21_5">And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_6" data-id="P21_6">And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_7" data-id="P21_7">And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_8" data-id="P21_8">For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_9" data-id="P21_9">But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_10" data-id="P21_10">Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_11" data-id="P21_11">For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_12" data-id="P21_12">Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_13" data-id="P21_13">Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_14" data-id="P21_14">Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_15" data-id="P21_15">Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_16" data-id="P21_16">For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_17" data-id="P21_17">For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_18" data-id="P21_18">And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_19" data-id="P21_19">We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_20" data-id="P21_20">Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_21" data-id="P21_21">For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</span>
