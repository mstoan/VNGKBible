<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS90_3" data-id="PS90_3">Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS90_4" data-id="PS90_4">For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS90_5" data-id="PS90_5">Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.</span>
