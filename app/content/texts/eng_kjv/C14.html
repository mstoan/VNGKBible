<div class="c">4</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C14_1" data-id="C14_1">Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C14_2" data-id="C14_2">Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C14_3" data-id="C14_3">But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C14_4" data-id="C14_4">For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C14_5" data-id="C14_5">Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C14_6" data-id="C14_6">And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C14_7" data-id="C14_7">For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C14_8" data-id="C14_8">Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C14_9" data-id="C14_9">For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C14_10" data-id="C14_10">We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C14_11" data-id="C14_11">Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C14_12" data-id="C14_12">And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C14_13" data-id="C14_13">Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C14_14" data-id="C14_14">I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C14_15" data-id="C14_15">For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C14_16" data-id="C14_16">Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C14_17" data-id="C14_17">For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C14_18" data-id="C14_18">Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C14_19" data-id="C14_19">But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C14_20" data-id="C14_20">For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C14_21" data-id="C14_21">What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?</span>
