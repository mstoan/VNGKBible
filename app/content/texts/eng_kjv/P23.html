<div class="c">3</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v P23_1" data-id="P23_1">This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v P23_2" data-id="P23_2">That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v P23_3" data-id="P23_3">Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v P23_4" data-id="P23_4">And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v P23_5" data-id="P23_5">For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v P23_6" data-id="P23_6">Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v P23_7" data-id="P23_7">But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v P23_8" data-id="P23_8">But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v P23_9" data-id="P23_9">The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v P23_10" data-id="P23_10">But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v P23_11" data-id="P23_11">Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v P23_12" data-id="P23_12">Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v P23_13" data-id="P23_13">Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v P23_14" data-id="P23_14">Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v P23_15" data-id="P23_15">And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v P23_16" data-id="P23_16">As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v P23_17" data-id="P23_17">Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v P23_18" data-id="P23_18">But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.</span>
