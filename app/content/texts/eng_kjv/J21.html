<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_2" data-id="J21_2">For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_3" data-id="J21_3">Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_4" data-id="J21_4">I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_5" data-id="J21_5">And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_6" data-id="J21_6">And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_7" data-id="J21_7">For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_8" data-id="J21_8">Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_9" data-id="J21_9">Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_10" data-id="J21_10">If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_11" data-id="J21_11">For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.</span>
