<div class="c">5</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB5_1" data-id="TB5_1">Tobias then answered and said, Father, I will do all things which thou hast commanded me:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB5_2" data-id="TB5_2">But how can I receive the money, seeing I know him not?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB5_3" data-id="TB5_3">Then he gave him the handwriting, and said unto him, Seek thee a man which may go with thee, whiles I yet live, and I will give him wages: and go and receive the money.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB5_4" data-id="TB5_4">Therefore when he went to seek a man, he found Raphael that was an angel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB5_4" data-id="TB5_4">But he knew not; and he said unto him, Canst thou go with me to Rages? and knowest thou those places well?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB5_5" data-id="TB5_5">But he knew not; and he said unto him, Canst thou go with me to Rages? and knowest thou those places well?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB5_6" data-id="TB5_6">To whom the angel said, I will go with thee, and I know the way well: for I have lodged with our brother Gabael.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB5_7" data-id="TB5_7">Then Tobias said unto him, Tarry for me, till I tell my father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB5_8" data-id="TB5_8">Then he said unto him, Go and tarry not. So he went in and said to his father, Behold, I have found one which will go with me. Then he said, Call him unto me, that I may know of what tribe he is, and whether he be a trusty man to go with thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB5_9" data-id="TB5_9">Then he said unto him, Go and tarry not. So he went in and said to his father, Behold, I have found one which will go with me. Then he said, Call him unto me, that I may know of what tribe he is, and whether he be a trusty man to go with thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB5_10" data-id="TB5_10">So he called him, and he came in, and they saluted one another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB5_11" data-id="TB5_11">Then Tobit said unto him, Brother, shew me of what tribe and family thou art.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB5_12" data-id="TB5_12">To whom he said, Dost thou seek for a tribe or family, or an hired man to go with thy son? Then Tobit said unto him, I would know, brother, thy kindred and name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB5_13" data-id="TB5_13">Then he said, I am Azarias, the son of Ananias the great, and of thy brethren.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB5_14" data-id="TB5_14">Then Tobit said, Thou art welcome, brother; be not now angry with me, because I have enquired to know thy tribe and thy family; for thou art my brother, of an honest and good stock: for I know Ananias and Jonathas, sons of that great Samaias, as we went together to Jerusalem to worship, and offered the firstborn, and the tenths of the fruits; and they were not seduced with the error of our brethren: my brother, thou art of a good stock.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB5_15" data-id="TB5_15">But tell me, what wages shall I give thee? wilt thou a drachm a day, and things necessary, as to mine own son?</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB5_16" data-id="TB5_16">Yea, moreover, if ye return safe, I will add something to thy wages.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB5_17" data-id="TB5_17">So they were well pleased. Then said he to Tobias, Prepare thyself for the journey, and God send you a good journey. And when his son had prepared all things far the journey, his father said, Go thou with this man, and God, which dwelleth in heaven, prosper your journey, and the angel of God keep you company. So they went forth both, and the young man's dog with them.</span>
