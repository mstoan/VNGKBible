<div class="c">26</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_1" data-id="MT26_1">And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_2" data-id="MT26_2">Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_3" data-id="MT26_3">Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_4" data-id="MT26_4">And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_5" data-id="MT26_5">But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_6" data-id="MT26_6">Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_7" data-id="MT26_7">There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_8" data-id="MT26_8">But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_9" data-id="MT26_9">For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_10" data-id="MT26_10">When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_11" data-id="MT26_11">For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_12" data-id="MT26_12">For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_13" data-id="MT26_13">Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_14" data-id="MT26_14">Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_15" data-id="MT26_15">And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_16" data-id="MT26_16">And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_17" data-id="MT26_17">Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_18" data-id="MT26_18">And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_19" data-id="MT26_19">And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_20" data-id="MT26_20">Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_21" data-id="MT26_21">And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_22" data-id="MT26_22">And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_23" data-id="MT26_23">And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_24" data-id="MT26_24">The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_25" data-id="MT26_25">Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_26" data-id="MT26_26">And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_27" data-id="MT26_27">And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_28" data-id="MT26_28">For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_29" data-id="MT26_29">But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_30" data-id="MT26_30">And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_31" data-id="MT26_31">Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_32" data-id="MT26_32">But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_33" data-id="MT26_33">Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_34" data-id="MT26_34">Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_35" data-id="MT26_35">Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_36" data-id="MT26_36">Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_37" data-id="MT26_37">And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_38" data-id="MT26_38">Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_39" data-id="MT26_39">And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_40" data-id="MT26_40">And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_41" data-id="MT26_41">Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_42" data-id="MT26_42">He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_43" data-id="MT26_43">And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_44" data-id="MT26_44">And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_45" data-id="MT26_45">Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_46" data-id="MT26_46">Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_47" data-id="MT26_47">And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_48" data-id="MT26_48">Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_49" data-id="MT26_49">And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_50" data-id="MT26_50">And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_51" data-id="MT26_51">And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_52" data-id="MT26_52">Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_53" data-id="MT26_53">Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</span>
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_54" data-id="MT26_54">But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</span>
<span class="v-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_55" data-id="MT26_55">In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_56" data-id="MT26_56">But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_57" data-id="MT26_57">And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_58" data-id="MT26_58">But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</span>
<span class="v-num v-59">59&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_59" data-id="MT26_59">Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</span>
<span class="v-num v-60">60&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_60" data-id="MT26_60">But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</span>
<span class="v-num v-61">61&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_61" data-id="MT26_61">And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-62">62&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_62" data-id="MT26_62">And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</span>
<span class="v-num v-63">63&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_63" data-id="MT26_63">But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-64">64&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_64" data-id="MT26_64">Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-65">65&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_65" data-id="MT26_65">Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-66">66&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_66" data-id="MT26_66">What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-67">67&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_67" data-id="MT26_67">Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,</span>
<span class="v-num v-68">68&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_68" data-id="MT26_68">Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</span>
<span class="v-num v-69">69&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_69" data-id="MT26_69">Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-70">70&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_70" data-id="MT26_70">But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-71">71&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_71" data-id="MT26_71">And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-72">72&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_72" data-id="MT26_72">And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-73">73&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_73" data-id="MT26_73">And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-74">74&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_74" data-id="MT26_74">Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</span>
<span class="v-num v-75">75&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_75" data-id="MT26_75">And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</span>
