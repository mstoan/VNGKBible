<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM6_2" data-id="AM6_2">Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM6_3" data-id="AM6_3">Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM6_4" data-id="AM6_4">That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM6_5" data-id="AM6_5">That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of musick, like David;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM6_6" data-id="AM6_6">That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM6_7" data-id="AM6_7">Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM6_8" data-id="AM6_8">The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM6_9" data-id="AM6_9">And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM6_10" data-id="AM6_10">And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM6_11" data-id="AM6_11">For, behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM6_12" data-id="AM6_12">Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow there with oxen? for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:</span>
