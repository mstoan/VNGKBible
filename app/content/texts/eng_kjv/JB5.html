<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB5_2" data-id="JB5_2">For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB5_3" data-id="JB5_3">I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</span>
