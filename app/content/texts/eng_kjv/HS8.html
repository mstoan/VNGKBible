<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_2" data-id="HS8_2">Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_3" data-id="HS8_3">Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall pursue him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_4" data-id="HS8_4">They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_5" data-id="HS8_5">Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_6" data-id="HS8_6">For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_7" data-id="HS8_7">For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_8" data-id="HS8_8">Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_9" data-id="HS8_9">For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_10" data-id="HS8_10">Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_11" data-id="HS8_11">Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_12" data-id="HS8_12">I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_13" data-id="HS8_13">They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_14" data-id="HS8_14">For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.</span>
