<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS5_2" data-id="PS5_2">Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS5_3" data-id="PS5_3">My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS5_4" data-id="PS5_4">For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS5_5" data-id="PS5_5">The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS5_6" data-id="PS5_6">Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS5_7" data-id="PS5_7">But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS5_8" data-id="PS5_8">Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS5_9" data-id="PS5_9">For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS5_10" data-id="PS5_10">Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS5_11" data-id="PS5_11">But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS5_12" data-id="PS5_12">For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.</span>
