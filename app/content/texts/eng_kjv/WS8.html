<div class="c">8</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS8_1" data-id="WS8_1">Wisdom reacheth from one end to another mightily: and sweetly doth she order all things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS8_2" data-id="WS8_2">I loved her, and sought her out from my youth, I desired to make her my spouse, and I was a lover of her beauty.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS8_3" data-id="WS8_3">In that she is conversant with God, she magnifieth her nobility: yea, the Lord of all things himself loved her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS8_4" data-id="WS8_4">For she is privy to the mysteries of the knowledge of God, and a lover of his works.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS8_5" data-id="WS8_5">If riches be a possession to be desired in this life; what is richer than wisdom, that worketh all things?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS8_6" data-id="WS8_6">And if prudence work; who of all that are is a more cunning workman than she?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS8_7" data-id="WS8_7">And if a man love righteousness her labours are virtues: for she teacheth temperance and prudence, justice and fortitude: which are such things, as en can have nothing more profitable in their life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS8_8" data-id="WS8_8">If a man desire much experience, she knoweth things of old, and conjectureth aright what is to come: she knoweth the subtilties of speeches, and can expound dark sentences: she foreseeth signs and wonders, and the events of seasons and times.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS8_9" data-id="WS8_9">Therefore I purposed to take her to me to live with me, knowing that she would be a counsellor of good things, and a comfort in cares and grief.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS8_10" data-id="WS8_10">For her sake I shall have estimation among the multitude, and honour with the elders, though I be young.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS8_11" data-id="WS8_11">I shall be found of a quick conceit in judgment, and shall be admired in the sight of great men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS8_12" data-id="WS8_12">When I hold my tongue, they shall bide my leisure, and when I speak, they shall give good ear unto me: if I talk much, they shall lay their hands upon their mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS8_13" data-id="WS8_13">Moreover by the means of her I shall obtain immortality, and leave behind me an everlasting memorial to them that come after me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS8_14" data-id="WS8_14">I shall set the people in order, and the nations shall be subject unto me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS8_15" data-id="WS8_15">Horrible tyrants shall be afraid, when they do but hear of me; I shall be found good among the multitude, and valiant in war.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS8_16" data-id="WS8_16">After I am come into mine house, I will repose myself with her: for her conversation hath no bitterness; and to live with her hath no sorrow, but mirth and joy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS8_17" data-id="WS8_17">Now when I considered these things in myself, and pondered them in my heart, how that to be allied unto wisdom is immortality;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS8_18" data-id="WS8_18">And great pleasure it is to have her friendship; and in the works of her hands are infinite riches; and in the exercise of conference with her, prudence; and in talking with her, a good report; I went about seeking how to take her to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS8_19" data-id="WS8_19">For I was a witty child, and had a good spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS8_20" data-id="WS8_20">Yea rather, being good, I came into a body undefiled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS8_21" data-id="WS8_21">Nevertheless, when I perceived that I could not otherwise obtain her, except God gave her me; and that was a point of wisdom also to know whose gift she was; I prayed unto the Lord, and besought him, and with my whole heart I said,</span>
