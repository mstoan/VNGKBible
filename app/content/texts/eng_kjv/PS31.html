<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS31_2" data-id="PS31_2">Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS31_3" data-id="PS31_3">For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS31_4" data-id="PS31_4">Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my strength.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS31_5" data-id="PS31_5">Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS31_6" data-id="PS31_6">I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS31_7" data-id="PS31_7">I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS31_8" data-id="PS31_8">And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS31_9" data-id="PS31_9">Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS31_10" data-id="PS31_10">For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS31_11" data-id="PS31_11">I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS31_12" data-id="PS31_12">I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS31_13" data-id="PS31_13">For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS31_14" data-id="PS31_14">But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS31_16" data-id="PS31_16">Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS31_17" data-id="PS31_17">Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS31_18" data-id="PS31_18">Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS31_19" data-id="PS31_19">Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS31_20" data-id="PS31_20">Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS31_21" data-id="PS31_21">Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS31_22" data-id="PS31_22">For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS31_23" data-id="PS31_23">O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS31_24" data-id="PS31_24">Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.</span>
