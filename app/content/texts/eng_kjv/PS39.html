<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS39_2" data-id="PS39_2">I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS39_3" data-id="PS39_3">My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS39_4" data-id="PS39_4">LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; that I may know how frail I am.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS39_5" data-id="PS39_5">Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS39_6" data-id="PS39_6">Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS39_7" data-id="PS39_7">And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS39_8" data-id="PS39_8">Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS39_9" data-id="PS39_9">I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS39_10" data-id="PS39_10">Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS39_11" data-id="PS39_11">When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is vanity. Selah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS39_12" data-id="PS39_12">Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS39_13" data-id="PS39_13">O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.</span>
