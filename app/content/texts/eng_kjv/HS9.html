<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_2" data-id="HS9_2">The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_3" data-id="HS9_3">They shall not dwell in the LORD's land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_4" data-id="HS9_4">They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_5" data-id="HS9_5">What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_6" data-id="HS9_6">For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant places for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be in their tabernacles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_7" data-id="HS9_7">The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_8" data-id="HS9_8">The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_9" data-id="HS9_9">They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_10" data-id="HS9_10">I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time: but they went to Baal-peor, and separated themselves unto that shame; and their abominations were according as they loved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_11" data-id="HS9_11">As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_12" data-id="HS9_12">Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_14" data-id="HS9_14">Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_15" data-id="HS9_15">All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will love them no more: all their princes are revolters.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_16" data-id="HS9_16">Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_17" data-id="HS9_17">My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.</span>
