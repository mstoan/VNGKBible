<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS49_2" data-id="PS49_2">Both low and high, rich and poor, together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS49_3" data-id="PS49_3">My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS49_4" data-id="PS49_4">I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS49_5" data-id="PS49_5">Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS49_6" data-id="PS49_6">They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS49_7" data-id="PS49_7">None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS49_9" data-id="PS49_9">That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS49_10" data-id="PS49_10">For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS49_11" data-id="PS49_11">Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS49_12" data-id="PS49_12">Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS49_13" data-id="PS49_13">This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS49_14" data-id="PS49_14">Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.</span>
