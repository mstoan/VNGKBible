<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_2" data-id="C113_2">And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_3" data-id="C113_3">And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_4" data-id="C113_4">Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_5" data-id="C113_5">Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_6" data-id="C113_6">Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_7" data-id="C113_7">Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_8" data-id="C113_8">Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_9" data-id="C113_9">For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_10" data-id="C113_10">But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_11" data-id="C113_11">When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_12" data-id="C113_12">For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_13" data-id="C113_13">And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.</span>
