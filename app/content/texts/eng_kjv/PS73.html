<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_2" data-id="PS73_2">But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_3" data-id="PS73_3">For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_4" data-id="PS73_4">For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_5" data-id="PS73_5">They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_6" data-id="PS73_6">Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_7" data-id="PS73_7">Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_8" data-id="PS73_8">They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_9" data-id="PS73_9">They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_10" data-id="PS73_10">Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_11" data-id="PS73_11">And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_12" data-id="PS73_12">Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_13" data-id="PS73_13">Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_14" data-id="PS73_14">For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_15" data-id="PS73_15">If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_16" data-id="PS73_16">When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_17" data-id="PS73_17">Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_18" data-id="PS73_18">Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_19" data-id="PS73_19">How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_20" data-id="PS73_20">As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_21" data-id="PS73_21">Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_22" data-id="PS73_22">So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_23" data-id="PS73_23">Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_24" data-id="PS73_24">Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_25" data-id="PS73_25">Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_26" data-id="PS73_26">My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_27" data-id="PS73_27">For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_28" data-id="PS73_28">But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.</span>
