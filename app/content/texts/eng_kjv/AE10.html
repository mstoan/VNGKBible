<div class="c">10</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE10_1" data-id="AE10_1">And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE10_2" data-id="AE10_2">And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE10_3" data-id="AE10_3">For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE10_4" data-id="AE10_4">Then Mardocheus said, God hath done these things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE10_5" data-id="AE10_5">For I remember a dream which I saw concerning these matters, and nothing thereof hath failed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE10_6" data-id="AE10_6">A little fountain became a river, and there was light, and the sun, and much water: this river is Esther, whom the king married, and made queen:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE10_7" data-id="AE10_7">And the two dragons are I and Aman.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE10_8" data-id="AE10_8">And the nations were those that were assembled to destroy the name of the Jews:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE10_9" data-id="AE10_9">And my nation is this Israel, which cried to God, and were saved: for the Lord hath saved his people, and the Lord hath delivered us from all those evils, and God hath wrought signs and great wonders, which have not been done among the Gentiles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE10_10" data-id="AE10_10">Therefore hath he made two lots, one for the people of God, and another for all the Gentiles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE10_11" data-id="AE10_11">And these two lots came at the hour, and time, and day of judgment, before God among all nations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE10_12" data-id="AE10_12">So God remembered his people, and justified his inheritance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE10_13" data-id="AE10_13">Therefore those days shall be unto them in the month Adar, the fourteenth and fifteenth day of the same month, with an assembly, and joy, and with gladness before God, according to the generations for ever among his people.</span>
