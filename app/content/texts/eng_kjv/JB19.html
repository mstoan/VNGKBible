<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_2" data-id="JB19_2">How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_3" data-id="JB19_3">These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_4" data-id="JB19_4">And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_5" data-id="JB19_5">If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_6" data-id="JB19_6">Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_7" data-id="JB19_7">Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_8" data-id="JB19_8">He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_9" data-id="JB19_9">He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_10" data-id="JB19_10">He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_11" data-id="JB19_11">He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_12" data-id="JB19_12">His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_13" data-id="JB19_13">He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_14" data-id="JB19_14">My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_15" data-id="JB19_15">They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_16" data-id="JB19_16">I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_17" data-id="JB19_17">My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_18" data-id="JB19_18">Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_19" data-id="JB19_19">All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_20" data-id="JB19_20">My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_21" data-id="JB19_21">Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_22" data-id="JB19_22">Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_23" data-id="JB19_23">Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_24" data-id="JB19_24">That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_25" data-id="JB19_25">For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_26" data-id="JB19_26">And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_27" data-id="JB19_27">Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_28" data-id="JB19_28">But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_29" data-id="JB19_29">Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.</span>
