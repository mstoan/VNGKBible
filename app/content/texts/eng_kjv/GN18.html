<div class="c">18</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_1" data-id="GN18_1">And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_2" data-id="GN18_2">And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_3" data-id="GN18_3">And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_4" data-id="GN18_4">Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_5" data-id="GN18_5">And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_6" data-id="GN18_6">And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_7" data-id="GN18_7">And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_8" data-id="GN18_8">And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_9" data-id="GN18_9">And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_10" data-id="GN18_10">And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_11" data-id="GN18_11">Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_12" data-id="GN18_12">Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_13" data-id="GN18_13">And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_14" data-id="GN18_14">Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_15" data-id="GN18_15">Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_16" data-id="GN18_16">And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_17" data-id="GN18_17">And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_18" data-id="GN18_18">Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_19" data-id="GN18_19">For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_20" data-id="GN18_20">And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_21" data-id="GN18_21">I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_22" data-id="GN18_22">And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_23" data-id="GN18_23">And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_24" data-id="GN18_24">Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_25" data-id="GN18_25">That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_26" data-id="GN18_26">And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_27" data-id="GN18_27">And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes:</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_28" data-id="GN18_28">Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_29" data-id="GN18_29">And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_30" data-id="GN18_30">And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_31" data-id="GN18_31">And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_32" data-id="GN18_32">And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_33" data-id="GN18_33">And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.</span>
