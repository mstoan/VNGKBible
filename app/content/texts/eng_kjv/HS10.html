<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_2" data-id="HS10_2">Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_3" data-id="HS10_3">For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_4" data-id="HS10_4">They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_5" data-id="HS10_5">The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Beth-aven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_6" data-id="HS10_6">It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_7" data-id="HS10_7">As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_8" data-id="HS10_8">The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_9" data-id="HS10_9">O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_10" data-id="HS10_10">It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_11" data-id="HS10_11">And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_12" data-id="HS10_12">Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.</span>
