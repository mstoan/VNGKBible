<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR47_15" data-id="SR47_15">Thy soul covered the whole earth, and thou filledst it with dark parables.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR47_16" data-id="SR47_16">Thy name went far unto the islands; and for thy peace thou wast beloved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR47_17" data-id="SR47_17">The countries marvelled at thee for thy songs, and proverbs, and parables, and interpretations.</span>
