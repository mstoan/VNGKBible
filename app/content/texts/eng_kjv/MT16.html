<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT16_7" data-id="MT16_7">And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT16_8" data-id="MT16_8">Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT16_9" data-id="MT16_9">Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT16_10" data-id="MT16_10">Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT16_11" data-id="MT16_11">How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT16_15" data-id="MT16_15">He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT16_16" data-id="MT16_16">And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT16_17" data-id="MT16_17">And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT16_18" data-id="MT16_18">And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT16_19" data-id="MT16_19">And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT16_20" data-id="MT16_20">Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.</span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT16_22" data-id="MT16_22">Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT16_23" data-id="MT16_23">But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.</span>
