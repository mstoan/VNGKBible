I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS63_2" data-id="IS63_2">Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS63_3" data-id="IS63_3">I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS63_4" data-id="IS63_4">For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS63_5" data-id="IS63_5">And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS63_7" data-id="IS63_7">I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS63_8" data-id="IS63_8">For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: so he was their Saviour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS63_9" data-id="IS63_9">In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS63_10" data-id="IS63_10">But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS63_11" data-id="IS63_11">Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS63_12" data-id="IS63_12">That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name?</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS63_14" data-id="IS63_14">As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS63_15" data-id="IS63_15">Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they restrained?</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS63_16" data-id="IS63_16">Doubtless thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, art our father, our redeemer; thy name is from everlasting.</span>
