<div class="c">30</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_1" data-id="JR30_1">The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_2" data-id="JR30_2">Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_3" data-id="JR30_3">For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_4" data-id="JR30_4">And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_5" data-id="JR30_5">For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_6" data-id="JR30_6">Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_7" data-id="JR30_7">Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_8" data-id="JR30_8">For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_9" data-id="JR30_9">But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_10" data-id="JR30_10">Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_11" data-id="JR30_11">For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_12" data-id="JR30_12">For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound is grievous.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_13" data-id="JR30_13">There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_14" data-id="JR30_14">All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins were increased.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_15" data-id="JR30_15">Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_16" data-id="JR30_16">Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_17" data-id="JR30_17">For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_18" data-id="JR30_18">Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_19" data-id="JR30_19">And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_20" data-id="JR30_20">Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_21" data-id="JR30_21">And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_22" data-id="JR30_22">And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_23" data-id="JR30_23">Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_24" data-id="JR30_24">The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it.</span>
