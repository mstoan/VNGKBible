<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR18_22" data-id="JR18_22">Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR18_23" data-id="JR18_23">Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me: forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee; deal thus with them in the time of thine anger.</span>
