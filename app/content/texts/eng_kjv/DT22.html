<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT22_20" data-id="DT22_20">But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel:</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT22_21" data-id="DT22_21">Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father's house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT22_22" data-id="DT22_22">If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from Israel.</span>

<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT22_26" data-id="DT22_26">But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter:</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT22_27" data-id="DT22_27">For he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her.</span>
