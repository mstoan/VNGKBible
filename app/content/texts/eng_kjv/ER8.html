<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER8_34" data-id="ER8_34">By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER8_35" data-id="ER8_35">Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER8_36" data-id="ER8_36">And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God.</span>
