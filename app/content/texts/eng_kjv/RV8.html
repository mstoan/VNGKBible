<div class="c">8</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_1" data-id="RV8_1">And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_2" data-id="RV8_2">And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_3" data-id="RV8_3">And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_4" data-id="RV8_4">And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_5" data-id="RV8_5">And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_6" data-id="RV8_6">And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_7" data-id="RV8_7">The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_8" data-id="RV8_8">And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_9" data-id="RV8_9">And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_10" data-id="RV8_10">And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_11" data-id="RV8_11">And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_12" data-id="RV8_12">And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_13" data-id="RV8_13">And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!</span>
