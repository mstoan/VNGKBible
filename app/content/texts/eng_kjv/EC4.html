<div class="c">4</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_1" data-id="EC4_1">So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_2" data-id="EC4_2">Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_3" data-id="EC4_3">Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_4" data-id="EC4_4">Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_5" data-id="EC4_5">The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_6" data-id="EC4_6">Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_7" data-id="EC4_7">Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_8" data-id="EC4_8">There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_9" data-id="EC4_9">Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_10" data-id="EC4_10">For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_11" data-id="EC4_11">Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_12" data-id="EC4_12">And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_13" data-id="EC4_13">Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_14" data-id="EC4_14">For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_15" data-id="EC4_15">I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_16" data-id="EC4_16">There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</span>
