<div class="c">29</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_1" data-id="SR29_1">He that is merciful will lend unto his neighbour; and he that strengtheneth his hand keepeth the commandments.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_2" data-id="SR29_2">Lend to thy neighbour in time of his need, and pay thou thy neighbour again in due season.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_3" data-id="SR29_3">Keep thy word, and deal faithfully with him, and thou shalt always find the thing that is necessary for thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_4" data-id="SR29_4">Many, when a thing was lent them, reckoned it to be found, and put them to trouble that helped them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_5" data-id="SR29_5">Till he hath received, he will kiss a man's hand; and for his neighbour's money he will speak submissly: but when he should repay, he will prolong the time, and return words of grief, and complain of the time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_6" data-id="SR29_6">If he prevail, he shall hardly receive the half, and he will count as if he had found it: if not, he hath deprived him of his money, and he hath gotten him an enemy without cause: he payeth him with cursings and railings; and for honour he will pay him disgrace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_7" data-id="SR29_7">Many therefore have refused to lend for other men's ill dealing, fearing to be defrauded.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_8" data-id="SR29_8">Yet have thou patience with a man in poor estate, and delay not to shew him mercy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_9" data-id="SR29_9">Help the poor for the commandment's sake, and turn him not away because of his poverty.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_10" data-id="SR29_10">Lose thy money for thy brother and thy friend, and let it not rust under a stone to be lost.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_11" data-id="SR29_11">Lay up thy treasure according to the commandments of the most High, and it shall bring thee more profit than gold.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_12" data-id="SR29_12">Shut up alms in thy storehouses: and it shall deliver thee from all affliction.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_13" data-id="SR29_13">It shall fight for thee against thine enemies better than a mighty shield and strong spear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_14" data-id="SR29_14">An honest man is surety for his neighbour: but he that is impudent will forsake him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_15" data-id="SR29_15">Forget not the friendship of thy surety, for he hath given his life for thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_16" data-id="SR29_16">A sinner will overthrow the good estate of his surety:</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_17" data-id="SR29_17">And he that is of an unthankful mind will leave him [in danger] that delivered him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_18" data-id="SR29_18">Suretiship hath undone many of good estate, and shaken them as a wave of the sea: mighty men hath it driven from their houses, so that they wandered among strange nations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_19" data-id="SR29_19">A wicked man transgressing the commandments of the Lord shall fall into suretiship: and he that undertaketh and followeth other men's business for gain shall fall into suits.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_20" data-id="SR29_20">Help thy neighbour according to thy power, and beware that thou thyself fall not into the same.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_21" data-id="SR29_21">The chief thing for life is water, and bread, and clothing, and an house to cover shame.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_22" data-id="SR29_22">Better is the life of a poor man in a mean cottage, than delicate fare in another man's house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_23" data-id="SR29_23">Be it little or much, hold thee contented, that thou hear not the reproach of thy house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_24" data-id="SR29_24">For it is a miserable life to go from house to house: for where thou art a stranger, thou darest not open thy mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_25" data-id="SR29_25">Thou shalt entertain, and feast, and have no thanks: moreover thou shalt hear bitter words:</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_26" data-id="SR29_26">Come, thou stranger, and furnish a table, and feed me of that thou hast ready.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_27" data-id="SR29_27">Give place, thou stranger, to an honourable man; my brother cometh to be lodged, and I have need of mine house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR29_28" data-id="SR29_28">These things are grievous to a man of understanding; the upbraiding of houseroom, and reproaching of the lender.</span>
