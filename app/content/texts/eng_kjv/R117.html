<div class="c">17</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_1" data-id="R117_1">Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD remaineth under curtains.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_2" data-id="R117_2">Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for God is with thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_3" data-id="R117_3">And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_4" data-id="R117_4">Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_5" data-id="R117_5">For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_6" data-id="R117_6">Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_7" data-id="R117_7">Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_8" data-id="R117_8">And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_9" data-id="R117_9">Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_10" data-id="R117_10">And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_11" data-id="R117_11">And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_12" data-id="R117_12">He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_13" data-id="R117_13">I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_14" data-id="R117_14">But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_15" data-id="R117_15">According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_16" data-id="R117_16">And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_17" data-id="R117_17">And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_18" data-id="R117_18">What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_19" data-id="R117_19">O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_20" data-id="R117_20">O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_21" data-id="R117_21">And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_22" data-id="R117_22">For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_23" data-id="R117_23">Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_24" data-id="R117_24">Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_25" data-id="R117_25">For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_26" data-id="R117_26">And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_27" data-id="R117_27">Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.</span>
