<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_4" data-id="CL1_4">Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_5" data-id="CL1_5">For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_6" data-id="CL1_6">Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_7" data-id="CL1_7">As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_16" data-id="CL1_16">For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_17" data-id="CL1_17">And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_18" data-id="CL1_18">And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.</span>

<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_27" data-id="CL1_27">To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_28" data-id="CL1_28">Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_29" data-id="CL1_29">Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.</span>
