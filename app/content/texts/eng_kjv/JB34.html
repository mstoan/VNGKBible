<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_2" data-id="JB34_2">Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_3" data-id="JB34_3">For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_4" data-id="JB34_4">Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_5" data-id="JB34_5">For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_6" data-id="JB34_6">Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_7" data-id="JB34_7">What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_8" data-id="JB34_8">Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_9" data-id="JB34_9">For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_10" data-id="JB34_10">Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_11" data-id="JB34_11">For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_12" data-id="JB34_12">Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_13" data-id="JB34_13">Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_14" data-id="JB34_14">If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_15" data-id="JB34_15">All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_16" data-id="JB34_16">If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_17" data-id="JB34_17">Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_18" data-id="JB34_18">Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_19" data-id="JB34_19">How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_20" data-id="JB34_20">In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_21" data-id="JB34_21">For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_22" data-id="JB34_22">There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_23" data-id="JB34_23">For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_24" data-id="JB34_24">He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_25" data-id="JB34_25">Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_26" data-id="JB34_26">He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_27" data-id="JB34_27">Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_28" data-id="JB34_28">So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_29" data-id="JB34_29">When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_30" data-id="JB34_30">That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_31" data-id="JB34_31">Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_32" data-id="JB34_32">That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_33" data-id="JB34_33">Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_34" data-id="JB34_34">Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_35" data-id="JB34_35">Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_36" data-id="JB34_36">My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_37" data-id="JB34_37">For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</span>
