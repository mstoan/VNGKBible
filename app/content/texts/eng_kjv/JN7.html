<div class="c">7</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_1" data-id="JN7_1">After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_2" data-id="JN7_2">Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_3" data-id="JN7_3">His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_4" data-id="JN7_4">For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_5" data-id="JN7_5">For neither did his brethren believe in him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_6" data-id="JN7_6">Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_7" data-id="JN7_7">The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_8" data-id="JN7_8">Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_9" data-id="JN7_9">When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_10" data-id="JN7_10">But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_11" data-id="JN7_11">Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_12" data-id="JN7_12">And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_13" data-id="JN7_13">Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_14" data-id="JN7_14">Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_15" data-id="JN7_15">And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_16" data-id="JN7_16">Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_17" data-id="JN7_17">If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_18" data-id="JN7_18">He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_19" data-id="JN7_19">Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_20" data-id="JN7_20">The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_21" data-id="JN7_21">Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_22" data-id="JN7_22">Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_23" data-id="JN7_23">If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_24" data-id="JN7_24">Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_25" data-id="JN7_25">Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_26" data-id="JN7_26">But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_27" data-id="JN7_27">Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_28" data-id="JN7_28">Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_29" data-id="JN7_29">But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_30" data-id="JN7_30">Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_31" data-id="JN7_31">And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_32" data-id="JN7_32">The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_33" data-id="JN7_33">Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_34" data-id="JN7_34">Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_35" data-id="JN7_35">Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_36" data-id="JN7_36">What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_37" data-id="JN7_37">In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_38" data-id="JN7_38">He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_39" data-id="JN7_39">(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_40" data-id="JN7_40">Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_41" data-id="JN7_41">Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_42" data-id="JN7_42">Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_43" data-id="JN7_43">So there was a division among the people because of him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_44" data-id="JN7_44">And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_45" data-id="JN7_45">Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_46" data-id="JN7_46">The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_47" data-id="JN7_47">Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_48" data-id="JN7_48">Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_49" data-id="JN7_49">But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_50" data-id="JN7_50">Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_51" data-id="JN7_51">Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_52" data-id="JN7_52">They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_53" data-id="JN7_53">And every man went unto his own house.</span>
