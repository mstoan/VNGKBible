<div class="c">2</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_1" data-id="PP2_1">If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_2" data-id="PP2_2">Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_3" data-id="PP2_3">Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_4" data-id="PP2_4">Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_5" data-id="PP2_5">Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_6" data-id="PP2_6">Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_7" data-id="PP2_7">But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_8" data-id="PP2_8">And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_9" data-id="PP2_9">Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_10" data-id="PP2_10">That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_11" data-id="PP2_11">And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_12" data-id="PP2_12">Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_13" data-id="PP2_13">For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_14" data-id="PP2_14">Do all things without murmurings and disputings:</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_15" data-id="PP2_15">That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_16" data-id="PP2_16">Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_17" data-id="PP2_17">Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_18" data-id="PP2_18">For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_19" data-id="PP2_19">But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_20" data-id="PP2_20">For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_21" data-id="PP2_21">For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_22" data-id="PP2_22">But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_23" data-id="PP2_23">Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_24" data-id="PP2_24">But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_25" data-id="PP2_25">Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_26" data-id="PP2_26">For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_27" data-id="PP2_27">For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_28" data-id="PP2_28">I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_29" data-id="PP2_29">Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_30" data-id="PP2_30">Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.</span>
