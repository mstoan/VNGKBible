<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_2" data-id="RM12_2">And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_3" data-id="RM12_3">For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_4" data-id="RM12_4">For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_5" data-id="RM12_5">So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_6" data-id="RM12_6">Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_7" data-id="RM12_7">Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_8" data-id="RM12_8">Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_9" data-id="RM12_9">Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_10" data-id="RM12_10">Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_11" data-id="RM12_11">Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_12" data-id="RM12_12">Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_13" data-id="RM12_13">Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_14" data-id="RM12_14">Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_15" data-id="RM12_15">Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_16" data-id="RM12_16">Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_17" data-id="RM12_17">Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_18" data-id="RM12_18">If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_19" data-id="RM12_19">Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_20" data-id="RM12_20">Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_21" data-id="RM12_21">Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</span>
