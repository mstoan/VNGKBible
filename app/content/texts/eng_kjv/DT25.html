<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT25_3" data-id="DT25_3">Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother should seem vile unto thee.</span>

<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT25_6" data-id="DT25_6">And it shall be, that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his name be not put out of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT25_7" data-id="DT25_7">And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then let his brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband's brother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT25_8" data-id="DT25_8">Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and if he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her;</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT25_12" data-id="DT25_12">Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity her.</span>

<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT25_19" data-id="DT25_19">Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget it.</span>
