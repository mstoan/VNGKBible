<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB13_2" data-id="HB13_2">Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB13_3" data-id="HB13_3">Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB13_4" data-id="HB13_4">Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB13_9" data-id="HB13_9">Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB13_10" data-id="HB13_10">We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB13_11" data-id="HB13_11">For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB13_16" data-id="HB13_16">But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB13_17" data-id="HB13_17">Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB13_18" data-id="HB13_18">Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.</span>

<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB13_21" data-id="HB13_21">Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB13_22" data-id="HB13_22">And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB13_23" data-id="HB13_23">Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.</span>
