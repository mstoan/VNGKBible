<div class="c">4</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE4_1" data-id="AE4_1">When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE4_2" data-id="AE4_2">And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE4_3" data-id="AE4_3">And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE4_4" data-id="AE4_4">So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE4_5" data-id="AE4_5">Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE4_6" data-id="AE4_6">So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the king's gate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE4_7" data-id="AE4_7">And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE4_8" data-id="AE4_8">Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE4_9" data-id="AE4_9">And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE4_10" data-id="AE4_10">Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE4_11" data-id="AE4_11">All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE4_12" data-id="AE4_12">And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE4_13" data-id="AE4_13">Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE4_14" data-id="AE4_14">For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE4_15" data-id="AE4_15">Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE4_16" data-id="AE4_16">Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE4_17" data-id="AE4_17">So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE13_8" data-id="AE13_8">Then Mardocheus thought upon all the works of the Lord, and made his prayer unto him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE13_9" data-id="AE13_9">Saying, O Lord, Lord, the King Almighty: for the whole world is in thy power, and if thou hast appointed to save Israel, there is no man that can gainsay thee:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE13_10" data-id="AE13_10">For thou hast made heaven and earth, and all the wondrous things under the heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE13_11" data-id="AE13_11">Thou art Lord of all things, and and there is no man that can resist thee, which art the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE13_12" data-id="AE13_12">Thou knowest all things, and thou knowest, Lord, that it was neither in contempt nor pride, nor for any desire of glory, that I did not bow down to proud Aman.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE13_13" data-id="AE13_13">For I could have been content with good will for the salvation of Israel to kiss the soles of his feet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE13_14" data-id="AE13_14">But I did this, that I might not prefer the glory of man above the glory of God: neither will I worship any but thee, O God, neither will I do it in pride.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE13_15" data-id="AE13_15">And now, O Lord God and King, spare thy people: for their eyes are upon us to bring us to nought; yea, they desire to destroy the inheritance, that hath been thine from the beginning.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE13_16" data-id="AE13_16">Despise not the portion, which thou hast delivered out of Egypt for thine own self.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE13_17" data-id="AE13_17">Hear my prayer, and be merciful unto thine inheritance: turn our sorrow into joy, that we may live, O Lord, and praise thy name: and destroy not the mouths of them that praise thee, O Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AE13_18" data-id="AE13_18">All Israel in like manner cried most earnestly unto the Lord, because their death was before their eyes.</span>
