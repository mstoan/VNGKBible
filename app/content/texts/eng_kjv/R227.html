<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R227_2" data-id="R227_2">And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he entered not into the temple of the LORD. And the people did yet corruptly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R227_3" data-id="R227_3">He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R227_4" data-id="R227_4">Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R227_5" data-id="R227_5">He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R227_6" data-id="R227_6">So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R227_7" data-id="R227_7">Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</span>
