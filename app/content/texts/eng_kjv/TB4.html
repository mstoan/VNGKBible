<div class="c">4</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB4_1" data-id="TB4_1">In that day Tobit remembered the money which he had committed to Gabael in Rages of Media,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB4_2" data-id="TB4_2">And said with himself, I have wished for death; wherefore do I not call for my son Tobias that I may signify to him of the money before I die?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB4_3" data-id="TB4_3">And when he had called him, he said, My son, when I am dead, bury me; and despise not thy mother, but honour her all the days of thy life, and do that which shall please her, and grieve her not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB4_4" data-id="TB4_4">Remember, my son, that she saw many dangers for thee, when thou wast in her womb: and when she is dead, bury her by me in one grave.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB4_5" data-id="TB4_5">My son, be mindful of the Lord our God all thy days, and let not thy will be set to sin, or to transgress his commandments: do uprightly all thy life long, and follow not the ways of unrighteousness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB4_6" data-id="TB4_6">For if thou deal truly, thy doings shall prosperously succeed to thee, and to all them that live justly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB4_7" data-id="TB4_7">Give alms of thy substance; and when thou givest alms, let not thine eye be envious, neither turn thy face from any poor, and the face of God shall not be turned away from thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB4_8" data-id="TB4_8">If thou hast abundance give alms accordingly: if thou have but a little, be not afraid to give according to that little:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB4_9" data-id="TB4_9">For thou layest up a good treasure for thyself against the day of necessity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB4_10" data-id="TB4_10">Because that alms do deliver from death, and suffereth not to come into darkness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB4_11" data-id="TB4_11">For alms is a good gift unto all that give it in the sight of the most High.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB4_12" data-id="TB4_12">Beware of all whoredom, my son, and chiefly take a wife of the seed of thy fathers, and take not a strange woman to wife, which is not of thy father's tribe: for we are the children of the prophets, Noe, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: remember, my son, that our fathers from the beginning, even that they all married wives of their own kindred, and were blessed in their children, and their seed shall inherit the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB4_13" data-id="TB4_13">Now therefore, my son, love thy brethren, and despise not in thy heart thy brethren, the sons and daughters of thy people, in not taking a wife of them: for in pride is destruction and much trouble, and in lewdness is decay and great want: for lewdness is the mother of famine.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB4_14" data-id="TB4_14">Let not the wages of any man, which hath wrought for thee, tarry with thee, but give him it out of hand: for if thou serve God, he will also repay thee: be circumspect my son, in all things thou doest, and be wise in all thy conversation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB4_15" data-id="TB4_15">Do that to no man which thou hatest: drink not wine to make thee drunken: neither let drunkenness go with thee in thy journey.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB4_16" data-id="TB4_16">Give of thy bread to the hungry, and of thy garments to them that are naked; and according to thine abundance give alms: and let not thine eye be envious, when thou givest alms.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB4_17" data-id="TB4_17">Pour out thy bread on the burial of the just, but give nothing to the wicked.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB4_18" data-id="TB4_18">Ask counsel of all that are wise, and despise not any counsel that is profitable.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB4_19" data-id="TB4_19">Bless the Lord thy God alway, and desire of him that thy ways may be directed, and that all thy paths and counsels may prosper: for every nation hath not counsel; but the Lord himself giveth all good things, and he humbleth whom he will, as he will; now therefore, my son, remember my commandments, neither let them be put out of thy mind.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB4_20" data-id="TB4_20">And now I signify this to they that I committed ten talents to Gabael the son of Gabrias at Rages in Media.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v TB4_21" data-id="TB4_21">And fear not, my son, that we are made poor: for thou hast much wealth, if thou fear God, and depart from all sin, and do that which is pleasing in his sight.</span>
