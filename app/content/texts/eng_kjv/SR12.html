<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR12_5" data-id="SR12_5">Do well unto him that is lowly, but give not to the ungodly: hold back thy bread, and give it not unto him, lest he overmaster thee thereby: for [else] thou shalt receive twice as much evil for all the good thou shalt have done unto him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR12_6" data-id="SR12_6">For the most High hateth sinners, and will repay vengeance unto the ungodly, and keepeth them against the mighty day of their punishment.</span>
