<div class="c">2</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_1" data-id="JN2_1">And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_2" data-id="JN2_2">And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_3" data-id="JN2_3">And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_4" data-id="JN2_4">Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_5" data-id="JN2_5">His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_6" data-id="JN2_6">And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_7" data-id="JN2_7">Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_8" data-id="JN2_8">And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_9" data-id="JN2_9">When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_10" data-id="JN2_10">And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_11" data-id="JN2_11">This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_12" data-id="JN2_12">After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_13" data-id="JN2_13">And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_14" data-id="JN2_14">And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_15" data-id="JN2_15">And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_16" data-id="JN2_16">And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_17" data-id="JN2_17">And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_18" data-id="JN2_18">Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_19" data-id="JN2_19">Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_20" data-id="JN2_20">Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_21" data-id="JN2_21">But he spake of the temple of his body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_22" data-id="JN2_22">When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_23" data-id="JN2_23">Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_24" data-id="JN2_24">But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_25" data-id="JN2_25">And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.</span>
