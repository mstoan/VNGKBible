<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_3" data-id="MT28_3">His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_4" data-id="MT28_4">And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_5" data-id="MT28_5">And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_6" data-id="MT28_6">He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_7" data-id="MT28_7">And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_8" data-id="MT28_8">And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_9" data-id="MT28_9">And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_10" data-id="MT28_10">Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_11" data-id="MT28_11">Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_12" data-id="MT28_12">And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_13" data-id="MT28_13">Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_14" data-id="MT28_14">And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_15" data-id="MT28_15">So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_16" data-id="MT28_16">Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_17" data-id="MT28_17">And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_18" data-id="MT28_18">And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</span>
