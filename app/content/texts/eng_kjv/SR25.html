<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR25_2" data-id="SR25_2">Three sorts of men my soul hateth, and I am greatly offended at their life: a poor man that is proud, a rich man that is a liar, and an old adulterer that doateth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR25_3" data-id="SR25_3">If thou hast gathered nothing in thy youth, how canst thou find any thing in thine age?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR25_4" data-id="SR25_4">O how comely a thing is judgment for gray hairs, and for ancient men to know counsel!</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR25_5" data-id="SR25_5">O how comely is the wisdom of old men, and understanding and counsel to men of honour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR25_6" data-id="SR25_6">Much experience is the crown of old men, and the fear of God is their glory.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR25_7" data-id="SR25_7">There be nine things which I have judged in mine heart to be happy, and the tenth I will utter with my tongue: A man that hath joy of his children; and he that liveth to see the fall of his enemy:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR25_8" data-id="SR25_8">Well is him that dwelleth with a wife of understanding, and that hath not slipped with his tongue, and that hath not served a man more unworthy than himself:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR25_9" data-id="SR25_9">Well is him that hath found prudence, and he that speaketh in the ears of them that will hear:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR25_10" data-id="SR25_10">O how great is he that findeth wisdom! yet is there none above him that feareth the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR25_11" data-id="SR25_11">But the love of the Lord passeth all things for illumination: he that holdeth it, whereto shall he be likened?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR25_12" data-id="SR25_12">The fear of the Lord is the beginning of his love: and faith is the beginning of cleaving unto him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR25_13" data-id="SR25_13">[Give me] any plague, but the plague of the heart: and any wickedness, but the wickedness of a woman:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR25_14" data-id="SR25_14">And any affliction, but the affliction from them that hate me: and any revenge, but the revenge of enemies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR25_15" data-id="SR25_15">There is no head above the head of a serpent; and there is no wrath above the wrath of an enemy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR25_16" data-id="SR25_16">I had rather dwell with a lion and a dragon, than to keep house with a wicked woman.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR25_17" data-id="SR25_17">The wickedness of a woman changeth her face, and darkeneth her countenance like sackcloth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR25_18" data-id="SR25_18">Her husband shall sit among his neighbours; and when he heareth it shall sigh bitterly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR25_19" data-id="SR25_19">All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman: let the portion of a sinner fall upon her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR25_20" data-id="SR25_20">As the climbing up a sandy way is to the feet of the aged, so is a wife full of words to a quiet man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR25_21" data-id="SR25_21">Stumble not at the beauty of a woman, and desire her not for pleasure.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR25_22" data-id="SR25_22">A woman, if she maintain her husband, is full of anger, impudence, and much reproach.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR25_23" data-id="SR25_23">A wicked woman abateth the courage, maketh an heavy countenance and a wounded heart: a woman that will not comfort her husband in distress maketh weak hands and feeble knees.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR25_24" data-id="SR25_24">Of the woman came the beginning of sin, and through her we all die.</span>
