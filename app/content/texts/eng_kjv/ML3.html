<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_2" data-id="ML3_2">But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_3" data-id="ML3_3">And he shall sit as a refiner and purifer of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_4" data-id="ML3_4">Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_5" data-id="ML3_5">And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_6" data-id="ML3_6">For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_7" data-id="ML3_7">Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_8" data-id="ML3_8">Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_9" data-id="ML3_9">Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_10" data-id="ML3_10">Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_11" data-id="ML3_11">And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_12" data-id="ML3_12">And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_13" data-id="ML3_13">Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, What have we spoken so much against thee?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_14" data-id="ML3_14">Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts?</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_15" data-id="ML3_15">And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_16" data-id="ML3_16">Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_17" data-id="ML3_17">And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_18" data-id="ML3_18">Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.</span>
