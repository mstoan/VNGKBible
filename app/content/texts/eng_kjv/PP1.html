<div class="mt">Philippians</div><div class="c">1</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_1" data-id="PP1_1">Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_2" data-id="PP1_2">Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_3" data-id="PP1_3">I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_4" data-id="PP1_4">Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_5" data-id="PP1_5">For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_6" data-id="PP1_6">Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_7" data-id="PP1_7">Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_8" data-id="PP1_8">For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_9" data-id="PP1_9">And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_10" data-id="PP1_10">That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_11" data-id="PP1_11">Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_12" data-id="PP1_12">But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_13" data-id="PP1_13">So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_14" data-id="PP1_14">And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_15" data-id="PP1_15">Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_16" data-id="PP1_16">The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_17" data-id="PP1_17">But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_18" data-id="PP1_18">What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_19" data-id="PP1_19">For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_20" data-id="PP1_20">According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_21" data-id="PP1_21">For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_22" data-id="PP1_22">But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_23" data-id="PP1_23">For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_24" data-id="PP1_24">Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_25" data-id="PP1_25">And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_26" data-id="PP1_26">That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_27" data-id="PP1_27">Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_28" data-id="PP1_28">And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_29" data-id="PP1_29">For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_30" data-id="PP1_30">Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</span>
