<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC3_2" data-id="ZC3_2">And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC3_3" data-id="ZC3_3">Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC3_4" data-id="ZC3_4">And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC3_5" data-id="ZC3_5">And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC3_6" data-id="ZC3_6">And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC3_7" data-id="ZC3_7">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC3_8" data-id="ZC3_8">Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC3_9" data-id="ZC3_9">For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC3_10" data-id="ZC3_10">In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.</span>
