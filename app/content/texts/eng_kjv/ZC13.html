<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC13_2" data-id="ZC13_2">And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC13_3" data-id="ZC13_3">And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD: and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC13_4" data-id="ZC13_4">And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC13_5" data-id="ZC13_5">But he shall say, I am no prophet, I am an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC13_6" data-id="ZC13_6">And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC13_7" data-id="ZC13_7">Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC13_8" data-id="ZC13_8">And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC13_9" data-id="ZC13_9">And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The LORD is my God.</span>
