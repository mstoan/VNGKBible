<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS64_2" data-id="PS64_2">Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS64_3" data-id="PS64_3">Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS64_4" data-id="PS64_4">That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS64_5" data-id="PS64_5">They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS64_6" data-id="PS64_6">They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS64_7" data-id="PS64_7">But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS64_8" data-id="PS64_8">So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS64_9" data-id="PS64_9">And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS64_10" data-id="PS64_10">The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.</span>
