<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_2" data-id="CL3_2">Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_3" data-id="CL3_3">For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_4" data-id="CL3_4">When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_5" data-id="CL3_5">Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_6" data-id="CL3_6">For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_7" data-id="CL3_7">In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_8" data-id="CL3_8">But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_9" data-id="CL3_9">Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_10" data-id="CL3_10">And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_11" data-id="CL3_11">Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_12" data-id="CL3_12">Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_13" data-id="CL3_13">Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_14" data-id="CL3_14">And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_15" data-id="CL3_15">And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_16" data-id="CL3_16">Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_17" data-id="CL3_17">And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_18" data-id="CL3_18">Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_19" data-id="CL3_19">Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_20" data-id="CL3_20">Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_21" data-id="CL3_21">Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_22" data-id="CL3_22">Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_23" data-id="CL3_23">And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_24" data-id="CL3_24">Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_25" data-id="CL3_25">But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.</span>
