<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PN1_2" data-id="PN1_2">who hast made heaven and earth, with all the ornament thereof;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PN1_3" data-id="PN1_3">who hast bound the sea by the word of thy commandment; who hast shut up the deep, and sealed it by thy terrible and glorious name;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PN1_4" data-id="PN1_4">whom all men fear, and tremble before thy power;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PN1_5" data-id="PN1_5">for the majesty of thy glory cannot be borne, and thine angry threatening toward sinners is importable:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PN1_6" data-id="PN1_6">but thy merciful promise is unmeasurable and unsearchable;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PN1_7" data-id="PN1_7">for thou art the most high Lord, of great compassion, longsuffering, very merciful, and repentest of the evils of men. Thou, O Lord, according to thy great goodness hast promised repentance and forgiveness to them that have sinned against thee: and of thine infinite mercies hast appointed repentance unto sinners, that they may be saved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PN1_8" data-id="PN1_8">Thou therefore, O Lord, that art the God of the just, hast not appointed repentance to the just, as to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, which have not sinned against thee;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PN1_8" data-id="PN1_8">but thou hast appointed repentance unto me that am a sinner: for I have sinned above the number of the sands of the sea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PN1_9" data-id="PN1_9">but thou hast appointed repentance unto me that am a sinner: for I have sinned above the number of the sands of the sea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PN1_9" data-id="PN1_9">My transgressions, O Lord, are multiplied: my transgressions are multiplied, and I am not worthy to behold and see the height of heaven for the multitude of mine iniquities. I am bowed down with many iron bands, that I cannot life up mine head, neither have any release: for I have provoked thy wrath, and done evil before thee: I did not thy will, neither kept I thy commandments: I have set up abominations, and have multiplied offences.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PN1_10" data-id="PN1_10">My transgressions, O Lord, are multiplied: my transgressions are multiplied, and I am not worthy to behold and see the height of heaven for the multitude of mine iniquities.

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PN1_11" data-id="PN1_11">Now therefore I bow the knee of mine heart, beseeching thee of grace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PN1_12" data-id="PN1_12">I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, and I acknowledge mine iniquities:</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PN1_13" data-id="PN1_13">wherefore, I humbly beseech thee, forgive me, O Lord, forgive me, and destroy me not with mine iniquites. Be not angry with me for ever, by reserving evil for me; neither condemn me to the lower parts of the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PN1_13" data-id="PN1_13">For thou art the God, even the God of them that repent; and in me thou wilt shew all thy goodness: for thou wilt save me, that am unworthy, according to thy great mercy.
