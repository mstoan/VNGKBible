<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_2" data-id="C16_2">Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_3" data-id="C16_3">Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_4" data-id="C16_4">If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_5" data-id="C16_5">I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_6" data-id="C16_6">But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_7" data-id="C16_7">Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_8" data-id="C16_8">Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_9" data-id="C16_9">Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_10" data-id="C16_10">Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_11" data-id="C16_11">And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_12" data-id="C16_12">All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_13" data-id="C16_13">Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_14" data-id="C16_14">And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_15" data-id="C16_15">Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_16" data-id="C16_16">What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_17" data-id="C16_17">But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_18" data-id="C16_18">Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that commiteth fornication sinneth against his own body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_19" data-id="C16_19">What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_20" data-id="C16_20">For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.</span>
