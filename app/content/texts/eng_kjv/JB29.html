<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB29_2" data-id="JB29_2">Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB29_3" data-id="JB29_3">When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB29_4" data-id="JB29_4">As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB29_5" data-id="JB29_5">When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB29_6" data-id="JB29_6">When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB29_7" data-id="JB29_7">When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street!</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB29_8" data-id="JB29_8">The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB29_9" data-id="JB29_9">The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB29_10" data-id="JB29_10">The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB29_11" data-id="JB29_11">When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB29_12" data-id="JB29_12">Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB29_13" data-id="JB29_13">The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.</span>
