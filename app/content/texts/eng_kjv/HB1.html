<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB1_2" data-id="HB1_2">Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB1_3" data-id="HB1_3">Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB1_4" data-id="HB1_4">Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB1_5" data-id="HB1_5">For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB1_6" data-id="HB1_6">And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.</span>
