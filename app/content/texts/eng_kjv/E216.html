<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v E216_42" data-id="E216_42">He that occupieth merchandise, as he that hath no profit by it: and he that buildeth, as he that shall not dwell therein:</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v E216_43" data-id="E216_43">He that soweth, as if he should not reap: so also he that planteth the vineyard, as he that shall not gather the grapes:</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v E216_44" data-id="E216_44">They that marry, as they that shall get no children; and they that marry not, as the widowers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v E216_45" data-id="E216_45">And therefore they that labour labour in vain:</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v E216_46" data-id="E216_46">For strangers shall reap their fruits, and spoil their goods, overthrow their houses, and take their children captives, for in captivity and famine shall they get children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v E216_47" data-id="E216_47">And they that occupy their merchandise with robbery, the more they deck their cities, their houses, their possessions, and their own persons:</span>

<span class="v-num v-60">60&nbsp;</span><span class="v E216_60" data-id="E216_60">In the desert hath he made springs of water, and pools upon the tops of the mountains, that the floods might pour down from the high rocks to water the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-61">61&nbsp;</span><span class="v E216_61" data-id="E216_61">He made man, and put his heart in the midst of the body, and gave him breath, life, and understanding.</span>

<span class="v-num v-65">65&nbsp;</span><span class="v E216_65" data-id="E216_65">And when your sins are brought forth, ye shall be ashamed before men, and your own sins shall be your accusers in that day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-66">66&nbsp;</span><span class="v E216_66" data-id="E216_66">What will ye do? or how will ye hide your sins before God and his angels?</span>
<span class="v-num v-67">67&nbsp;</span><span class="v E216_67" data-id="E216_67">Behold, God himself is the judge, fear him: leave off from your sins, and forget your iniquities, to meddle no more with them for ever: so shall God lead you forth, and deliver you from all trouble.</span>
<span class="v-num v-68">68&nbsp;</span><span class="v E216_68" data-id="E216_68">For, behold, the burning wrath of a great multitude is kindled over you, and they shall take away certain of you, and feed you, being idle, with things offered unto idols.</span>
<span class="v-num v-69">69&nbsp;</span><span class="v E216_69" data-id="E216_69">And they that consent unto them shall be had in derision and in reproach, and trodden under foot.</span>
