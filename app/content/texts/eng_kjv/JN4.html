<div class="c">4</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_1" data-id="JN4_1">When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_2" data-id="JN4_2">(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_3" data-id="JN4_3">He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_4" data-id="JN4_4">And he must needs go through Samaria.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_5" data-id="JN4_5">Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_6" data-id="JN4_6">Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_7" data-id="JN4_7">There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_8" data-id="JN4_8">(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_9" data-id="JN4_9">Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_10" data-id="JN4_10">Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_11" data-id="JN4_11">The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_12" data-id="JN4_12">Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_13" data-id="JN4_13">Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_14" data-id="JN4_14">But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_15" data-id="JN4_15">The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_16" data-id="JN4_16">Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_17" data-id="JN4_17">The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_18" data-id="JN4_18">For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_19" data-id="JN4_19">The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_20" data-id="JN4_20">Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_21" data-id="JN4_21">Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_22" data-id="JN4_22">Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_23" data-id="JN4_23">But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_24" data-id="JN4_24">God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_25" data-id="JN4_25">The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_26" data-id="JN4_26">Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_27" data-id="JN4_27">And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_28" data-id="JN4_28">The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_29" data-id="JN4_29">Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_30" data-id="JN4_30">Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_31" data-id="JN4_31">In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_32" data-id="JN4_32">But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_33" data-id="JN4_33">Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_34" data-id="JN4_34">Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_35" data-id="JN4_35">Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_36" data-id="JN4_36">And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_37" data-id="JN4_37">And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_38" data-id="JN4_38">I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_39" data-id="JN4_39">And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_40" data-id="JN4_40">So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_41" data-id="JN4_41">And many more believed because of his own word;</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_42" data-id="JN4_42">And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_43" data-id="JN4_43">Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_44" data-id="JN4_44">For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_45" data-id="JN4_45">Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_46" data-id="JN4_46">So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_47" data-id="JN4_47">When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_48" data-id="JN4_48">Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_49" data-id="JN4_49">The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_50" data-id="JN4_50">Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_51" data-id="JN4_51">And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_52" data-id="JN4_52">Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_53" data-id="JN4_53">So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_54" data-id="JN4_54">This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.</span>
