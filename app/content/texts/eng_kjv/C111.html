<div class="c">11</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_1" data-id="C111_1">Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_2" data-id="C111_2">Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_3" data-id="C111_3">But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_4" data-id="C111_4">Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_5" data-id="C111_5">But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_6" data-id="C111_6">For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_7" data-id="C111_7">For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_8" data-id="C111_8">For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_9" data-id="C111_9">Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_10" data-id="C111_10">For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_11" data-id="C111_11">Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_12" data-id="C111_12">For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of god.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_13" data-id="C111_13">Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_14" data-id="C111_14">Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_15" data-id="C111_15">But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_16" data-id="C111_16">But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_17" data-id="C111_17">Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_18" data-id="C111_18">For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_19" data-id="C111_19">For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_20" data-id="C111_20">When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_21" data-id="C111_21">For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_22" data-id="C111_22">What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_23" data-id="C111_23">For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_24" data-id="C111_24">And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_25" data-id="C111_25">After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_26" data-id="C111_26">For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_27" data-id="C111_27">Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_28" data-id="C111_28">But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_29" data-id="C111_29">For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_30" data-id="C111_30">For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_31" data-id="C111_31">For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_32" data-id="C111_32">But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_33" data-id="C111_33">Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_34" data-id="C111_34">And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.</span>
