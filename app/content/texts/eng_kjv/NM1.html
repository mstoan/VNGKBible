<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM1_2" data-id="NM1_2">God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM1_3" data-id="NM1_3">The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM1_4" data-id="NM1_4">He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM1_5" data-id="NM1_5">The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM1_6" data-id="NM1_6">Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM1_11" data-id="NM1_11">There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the LORD, a wicked counseller.</span>

O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.</span>
