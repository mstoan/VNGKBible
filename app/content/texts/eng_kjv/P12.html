<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_20" data-id="P12_20">For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_21" data-id="P12_21">For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:</span>
