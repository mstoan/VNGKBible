<div class="c">5</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_1" data-id="JN5_1">After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_2" data-id="JN5_2">Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_3" data-id="JN5_3">In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_4" data-id="JN5_4">For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_5" data-id="JN5_5">And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_6" data-id="JN5_6">When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_7" data-id="JN5_7">The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_8" data-id="JN5_8">Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_9" data-id="JN5_9">And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_10" data-id="JN5_10">The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_11" data-id="JN5_11">He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_12" data-id="JN5_12">Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_13" data-id="JN5_13">And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_14" data-id="JN5_14">Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_15" data-id="JN5_15">The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_16" data-id="JN5_16">And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_17" data-id="JN5_17">But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_18" data-id="JN5_18">Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_19" data-id="JN5_19">Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_20" data-id="JN5_20">For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_21" data-id="JN5_21">For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_22" data-id="JN5_22">For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_23" data-id="JN5_23">That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_24" data-id="JN5_24">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_25" data-id="JN5_25">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_26" data-id="JN5_26">For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_27" data-id="JN5_27">And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_28" data-id="JN5_28">Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_29" data-id="JN5_29">And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_30" data-id="JN5_30">I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_31" data-id="JN5_31">If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_32" data-id="JN5_32">There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_33" data-id="JN5_33">Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_34" data-id="JN5_34">But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_35" data-id="JN5_35">He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_36" data-id="JN5_36">But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_37" data-id="JN5_37">And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_38" data-id="JN5_38">And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_39" data-id="JN5_39">Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_40" data-id="JN5_40">And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_41" data-id="JN5_41">I receive not honour from men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_42" data-id="JN5_42">But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_43" data-id="JN5_43">I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_44" data-id="JN5_44">How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_45" data-id="JN5_45">Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_46" data-id="JN5_46">For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_47" data-id="JN5_47">But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?</span>
