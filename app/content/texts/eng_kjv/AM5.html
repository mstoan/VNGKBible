<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_2" data-id="AM5_2">The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_3" data-id="AM5_3">For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_4" data-id="AM5_4">For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_5" data-id="AM5_5">But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nought.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_6" data-id="AM5_6">Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Bethel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_7" data-id="AM5_7">Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_8" data-id="AM5_8">Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_9" data-id="AM5_9">That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_10" data-id="AM5_10">They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_11" data-id="AM5_11">Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_12" data-id="AM5_12">For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_13" data-id="AM5_13">Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_14" data-id="AM5_14">Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_15" data-id="AM5_15">Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_16" data-id="AM5_16">Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_17" data-id="AM5_17">And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through thee, saith the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_18" data-id="AM5_18">Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_19" data-id="AM5_19">As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_20" data-id="AM5_20">Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_21" data-id="AM5_21">I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_22" data-id="AM5_22">Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_23" data-id="AM5_23">Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_24" data-id="AM5_24">But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_25" data-id="AM5_25">Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_26" data-id="AM5_26">But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_27" data-id="AM5_27">Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts.</span>
