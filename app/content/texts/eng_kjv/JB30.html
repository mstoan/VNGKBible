<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_2" data-id="JB30_2">Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_3" data-id="JB30_3">For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_4" data-id="JB30_4">Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_5" data-id="JB30_5">They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;)</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_6" data-id="JB30_6">To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_7" data-id="JB30_7">Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_8" data-id="JB30_8">They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_9" data-id="JB30_9">And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_10" data-id="JB30_10">They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_11" data-id="JB30_11">Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_12" data-id="JB30_12">Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_13" data-id="JB30_13">They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_15" data-id="JB30_15">Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_16" data-id="JB30_16">And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_17" data-id="JB30_17">My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_18" data-id="JB30_18">By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_19" data-id="JB30_19">He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_20" data-id="JB30_20">I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_21" data-id="JB30_21">Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_22" data-id="JB30_22">Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_23" data-id="JB30_23">For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_24" data-id="JB30_24">Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_25" data-id="JB30_25">Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor?</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_26" data-id="JB30_26">When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_27" data-id="JB30_27">My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_28" data-id="JB30_28">I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_29" data-id="JB30_29">I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_30" data-id="JB30_30">My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB30_31" data-id="JB30_31">My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.</span>
