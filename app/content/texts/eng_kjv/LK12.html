<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_2" data-id="LK12_2">For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_3" data-id="LK12_3">Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_4" data-id="LK12_4">And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_5" data-id="LK12_5">But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_6" data-id="LK12_6">Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_7" data-id="LK12_7">But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_8" data-id="LK12_8">Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_9" data-id="LK12_9">But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_10" data-id="LK12_10">And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_11" data-id="LK12_11">And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_12" data-id="LK12_12">For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_15" data-id="LK12_15">And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_16" data-id="LK12_16">And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_17" data-id="LK12_17">And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_18" data-id="LK12_18">And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.</span>

<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_28" data-id="LK12_28">If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith?</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_29" data-id="LK12_29">And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_30" data-id="LK12_30">For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_31" data-id="LK12_31">But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_32" data-id="LK12_32">Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_33" data-id="LK12_33">Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_34" data-id="LK12_34">For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_35" data-id="LK12_35">Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_36" data-id="LK12_36">And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_37" data-id="LK12_37">Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_38" data-id="LK12_38">And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_39" data-id="LK12_39">And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK12_40" data-id="LK12_40">Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.</span>
