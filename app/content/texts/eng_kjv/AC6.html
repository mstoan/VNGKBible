<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_2" data-id="AC6_2">Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.</span>

<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_5" data-id="AC6_5">And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_6" data-id="AC6_6">Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.</span>
