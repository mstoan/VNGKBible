<div class="c">8</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_1" data-id="EC8_1">Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_2" data-id="EC8_2">I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_3" data-id="EC8_3">Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_4" data-id="EC8_4">Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_5" data-id="EC8_5">Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_6" data-id="EC8_6">Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_7" data-id="EC8_7">For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_8" data-id="EC8_8">There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_9" data-id="EC8_9">All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_10" data-id="EC8_10">And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_11" data-id="EC8_11">Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_12" data-id="EC8_12">Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_13" data-id="EC8_13">But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_14" data-id="EC8_14">There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_15" data-id="EC8_15">Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_16" data-id="EC8_16">When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC8_17" data-id="EC8_17">Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea further; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.</span>
