<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_28" data-id="LV8_28">And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_29" data-id="LV8_29">And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; as the LORD commanded Moses.</span>

<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_31" data-id="LV8_31">And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_32" data-id="LV8_32">And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_33" data-id="LV8_33">And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_34" data-id="LV8_34">As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to make an atonement for you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_35" data-id="LV8_35">Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV8_36" data-id="LV8_36">So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.</span>
