<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_2" data-id="HS11_2">As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_3" data-id="HS11_3">I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_4" data-id="HS11_4">I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_5" data-id="HS11_5">He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_6" data-id="HS11_6">And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_7" data-id="HS11_7">And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_8" data-id="HS11_8">How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_9" data-id="HS11_9">I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_10" data-id="HS11_10">They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_11" data-id="HS11_11">They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_12" data-id="HS11_12">Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints.</span>
