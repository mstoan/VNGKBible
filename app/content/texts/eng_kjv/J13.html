<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_2" data-id="J13_2">Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_3" data-id="J13_3">And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_4" data-id="J13_4">Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_5" data-id="J13_5">And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_6" data-id="J13_6">Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_7" data-id="J13_7">Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_8" data-id="J13_8">He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_9" data-id="J13_9">Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_10" data-id="J13_10">In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_11" data-id="J13_11">For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_12" data-id="J13_12">Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_13" data-id="J13_13">Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_14" data-id="J13_14">We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_15" data-id="J13_15">Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_16" data-id="J13_16">Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_17" data-id="J13_17">But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_18" data-id="J13_18">My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_19" data-id="J13_19">And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_20" data-id="J13_20">For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_21" data-id="J13_21">Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_22" data-id="J13_22">And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_23" data-id="J13_23">And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_24" data-id="J13_24">And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.</span>
