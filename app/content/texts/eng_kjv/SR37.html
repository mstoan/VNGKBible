<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR37_2" data-id="SR37_2">Is it not a grief unto death, when a companion and friend is turned to an enemy?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR37_3" data-id="SR37_3">O wicked imagination, whence camest thou in to cover the earth with deceit?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR37_4" data-id="SR37_4">There is a companion, which rejoiceth in the prosperity of a friend, but in the time of trouble will be against him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR37_5" data-id="SR37_5">There is a companion, which helpeth his friend for the belly, and taketh up the buckler against the enemy.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR37_7" data-id="SR37_7">Every counsellor extolleth counsel; but there is some that counselleth for himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR37_8" data-id="SR37_8">Beware of a counsellor, and know before what need he hath; for he will counsel for himself; lest he cast the lot upon thee,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR37_9" data-id="SR37_9">And say unto thee, Thy way is good: and afterward he stand on the other side, to see what shall befall thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR37_10" data-id="SR37_10">Consult not with one that suspecteth thee: and hide thy counsel from such as envy thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR37_11" data-id="SR37_11">Neither consult with a woman touching her of whom she is jealous; neither with a coward in matters of war; nor with a merchant concerning exchange; nor with a buyer of selling; nor with an envious man of thankfulness; nor with an unmerciful man touching kindness; nor with the slothful for any work; nor with an hireling for a year of finishing work; nor with an idle servant of much business: hearken not unto these in any matter of counsel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR37_12" data-id="SR37_12">But be continually with a godly man, whom thou knowest to keep the commandments of the Lord, whose, mind is according to thy mind, and will sorrow with thee, if thou shalt miscarry.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR37_13" data-id="SR37_13">And let the counsel of thine own heart stand: for there is no man more faithful unto thee than it.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR37_15" data-id="SR37_15">And above all this pray to the most High, that he will direct thy way in truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR37_16" data-id="SR37_16">Let reason go before every enterprize, and counsel before every action.</span>

<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR37_19" data-id="SR37_19">There is one that is wise and teacheth many, and yet is unprofitable to himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR37_20" data-id="SR37_20">There is one that sheweth wisdom in words, and is hated: he shall be destitute of all food.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR37_21" data-id="SR37_21">For grace is not given, him from the Lord, because he is deprived of all wisdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR37_22" data-id="SR37_22">Another is wise to himself; and the fruits of understanding are commendable in his mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR37_23" data-id="SR37_23">A wise man instructeth his people; and the fruits of his understanding fail not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR37_24" data-id="SR37_24">A wise man shall be filled with blessing; and all they that see him shall count him happy.</span>

<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR37_28" data-id="SR37_28">For all things are not profitable for all men, neither hath every soul pleasure in every thing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR37_29" data-id="SR37_29">Be not unsatiable in any dainty thing, nor too greedy upon meats:</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR37_30" data-id="SR37_30">For excess of meats bringeth sickness, and surfeiting will turn into choler.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR37_31" data-id="SR37_31">By surfeiting have many perished; but he that taketh heed prolongeth his life.</span>
