<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_6" data-id="LK13_6">He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_7" data-id="LK13_7">Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_8" data-id="LK13_8">And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:</span>

<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_26" data-id="LK13_26">Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_27" data-id="LK13_27">But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.</span>

<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_33" data-id="LK13_33">Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_34" data-id="LK13_34">O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not!</span>
