<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_2" data-id="JM5_2">Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_3" data-id="JM5_3">Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.</span>

<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_5" data-id="JM5_5">Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_6" data-id="JM5_6">Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_7" data-id="JM5_7">Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_8" data-id="JM5_8">Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_9" data-id="JM5_9">Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_10" data-id="JM5_10">Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_11" data-id="JM5_11">Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_12" data-id="JM5_12">But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_13" data-id="JM5_13">Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.</span>
