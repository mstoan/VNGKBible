<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v R220_30" data-id="R220_30">So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v R220_31" data-id="R220_31">And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v R220_32" data-id="R220_32">And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD.</span>
