<div class="c">5</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM5_1" data-id="RM5_1">Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM5_2" data-id="RM5_2">By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM5_3" data-id="RM5_3">And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM5_4" data-id="RM5_4">And patience, experience; and experience, hope:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM5_5" data-id="RM5_5">And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM5_6" data-id="RM5_6">For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM5_7" data-id="RM5_7">For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM5_8" data-id="RM5_8">But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM5_9" data-id="RM5_9">Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM5_10" data-id="RM5_10">For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM5_11" data-id="RM5_11">And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM5_12" data-id="RM5_12">Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM5_13" data-id="RM5_13">(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM5_14" data-id="RM5_14">Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM5_15" data-id="RM5_15">But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM5_16" data-id="RM5_16">And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM5_17" data-id="RM5_17">For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM5_18" data-id="RM5_18">Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM5_19" data-id="RM5_19">For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM5_20" data-id="RM5_20">Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM5_21" data-id="RM5_21">That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.</span>
