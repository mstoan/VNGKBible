<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_2" data-id="HS4_2">By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_3" data-id="HS4_3">Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_4" data-id="HS4_4">Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are as they that strive with the priest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_5" data-id="HS4_5">Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_6" data-id="HS4_6">My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_7" data-id="HS4_7">As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I change their glory into shame.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_8" data-id="HS4_8">They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_9" data-id="HS4_9">And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_10" data-id="HS4_10">For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_11" data-id="HS4_11">Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_12" data-id="HS4_12">My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_13" data-id="HS4_13">They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_14" data-id="HS4_14">I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_15" data-id="HS4_15">Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_16" data-id="HS4_16">For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_17" data-id="HS4_17">Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_18" data-id="HS4_18">Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers with shame do love, Give ye.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_19" data-id="HS4_19">The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.</span>
