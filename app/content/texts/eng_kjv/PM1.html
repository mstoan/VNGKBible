<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_2" data-id="PM1_2">And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_3" data-id="PM1_3">Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_4" data-id="PM1_4">I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_5" data-id="PM1_5">Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_6" data-id="PM1_6">That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_7" data-id="PM1_7">For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_8" data-id="PM1_8">Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_9" data-id="PM1_9">Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_10" data-id="PM1_10">I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_11" data-id="PM1_11">Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_12" data-id="PM1_12">Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_13" data-id="PM1_13">Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_14" data-id="PM1_14">But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_15" data-id="PM1_15">For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_16" data-id="PM1_16">Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_17" data-id="PM1_17">If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_18" data-id="PM1_18">If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_19" data-id="PM1_19">I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_20" data-id="PM1_20">Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_21" data-id="PM1_21">Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_22" data-id="PM1_22">But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_23" data-id="PM1_23">There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_24" data-id="PM1_24">Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_25" data-id="PM1_25">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</span>
