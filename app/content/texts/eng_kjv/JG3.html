<div class="c">3</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_1" data-id="JG3_1">Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_2" data-id="JG3_2">Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_3" data-id="JG3_3">Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entering in of Hamath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_4" data-id="JG3_4">And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_5" data-id="JG3_5">And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_6" data-id="JG3_6">And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_7" data-id="JG3_7">And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_8" data-id="JG3_8">Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_9" data-id="JG3_9">And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_10" data-id="JG3_10">And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_11" data-id="JG3_11">And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_12" data-id="JG3_12">And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_13" data-id="JG3_13">And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_14" data-id="JG3_14">So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_15" data-id="JG3_15">But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_16" data-id="JG3_16">But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_17" data-id="JG3_17">And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_18" data-id="JG3_18">And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_19" data-id="JG3_19">But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_20" data-id="JG3_20">And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_21" data-id="JG3_21">And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_22" data-id="JG3_22">And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_23" data-id="JG3_23">Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_24" data-id="JG3_24">When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_25" data-id="JG3_25">And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_26" data-id="JG3_26">And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_27" data-id="JG3_27">And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_28" data-id="JG3_28">And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_29" data-id="JG3_29">And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_30" data-id="JG3_30">So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_31" data-id="JG3_31">And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.</span>
