<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS19_2" data-id="WS19_2">How that having given them leave to depart, and sent them hastily away, they would repent and pursue them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS19_3" data-id="WS19_3">For whilst they were yet mourning and making lamentation at the graves of the dead, they added another foolish device, and pursued them as fugitives, whom they had intreated to be gone.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS19_4" data-id="WS19_4">For the destiny, whereof they were worthy, drew them unto this end, and made them forget the things that had already happened, that they might fulfil the punishment which was wanting to their torments:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS19_5" data-id="WS19_5">And that thy people might pass a wonderful way: but they might find a strange death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS19_6" data-id="WS19_6">For the whole creature in his proper kind was fashioned again anew, serving the peculiar commandments that were given unto them, that thy children might be kept without hurt:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS19_7" data-id="WS19_7">As namely, a cloud shadowing the camp; and where water stood before, dry land appeared; and out of the Red sea a way without impediment; and out of the violent stream a green field:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS19_8" data-id="WS19_8">Wherethrough all the people went that were defended with thy hand, seeing thy marvellous strange wonders.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS19_9" data-id="WS19_9">For they went at large like horses, and leaped like lambs, praising thee, O Lord, who hadst delivered them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS19_10" data-id="WS19_10">For they were yet mindful of the things that were done while they sojourned in the strange land, how the ground brought forth flies instead of cattle, and how the river cast up a multitude of frogs instead of fishes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS19_11" data-id="WS19_11">But afterwards they saw a new generation of fowls, when, being led with their appetite, they asked delicate meats.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS19_12" data-id="WS19_12">For quails came up unto them from the sea for their contentment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS19_13" data-id="WS19_13">And punishments came upon the sinners not without former signs by the force of thunders: for they suffered justly according to their own wickedness, insomuch as they used a more hard and hateful behaviour toward strangers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS19_14" data-id="WS19_14">For the Sodomites did not receive those, whom they knew not when they came: but these brought friends into bondage, that had well deserved of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS19_15" data-id="WS19_15">And not only so, but peradventure some respect shall be had of those, because they used strangers not friendly:</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS19_16" data-id="WS19_16">But these very grievously afflicted them, whom they had received with feastings, and were already made partakers of the same laws with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS19_17" data-id="WS19_17">Therefore even with blindness were these stricken, as those were at the doors of the righteous man: when, being compassed about with horrible great darkness, every one sought the passage of his own doors.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS19_18" data-id="WS19_18">For the elements were changed in themselves by a kind of harmony, like as in a psaltery notes change the name of the tune, and yet are always sounds; which may well be perceived by the sight of the things that have been done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS19_19" data-id="WS19_19">For earthly things were turned into watery, and the things, that before swam in the water, now went upon the ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS19_20" data-id="WS19_20">The fire had power in the water, forgetting his own virtue: and the water forgat his own quenching nature.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS19_21" data-id="WS19_21">On the other side, the flames wasted not the flesh of the corruptible living things, though they walked therein; neither melted they the icy kind of heavenly meat that was of nature apt to melt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS19_22" data-id="WS19_22">For in all things, O Lord, thou didst magnify thy people, and glorify them, neither didst thou lightly regard them: but didst assist them in every time and place. .</span>

<span class="v-num v-0">0&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR1_0" data-id="SR1_0">[A Prologue made by an uncertain Author] This Jesus was the son of Sirach, and grandchild to Jesus of the same name with him: this man therefore lived in the latter times, after the people had been led away captive, and called home a again, and almost after all the prophets. Now his grandfather Jesus, as he himself witnesseth, was a man of great diligence and wisdom among the Hebrews, who did not only gather the grave and short sentences of wise men, that had been before him, but himself also uttered some of his own, full of much understanding and wisdom. When as therefore the first Jesus died, leaving this book almost perfected, Sirach his son receiving it after him left it to his own son Jesus, who, having gotten it into his hands, compiled it all orderly into one volume, and called it Wisdom, intituling it both by his own name, his father's name, and his grandfather's; alluring the hearer by the very name of Wisdom to have a greater love to the study of this book. It containeth therefore wise sayings, dark sentences, and parables, and certain particular ancient godly stories of men that pleased God; also his prayer and song; moreover, what benefits God had vouchsafed his people, and what plagues he had heaped upon their enemies. This Jesus did imitate Solomon, and was no less famous for wisdom and learning, both being indeed a man of great learning, and so reputed also. [The Prologue of the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach.] Whereas many and great things have been delivered unto us by the law and the prophets, and by others that have followed their steps, for the which things Israel ought to be commended for learning and wisdom; and whereof not only the readers must needs become skilful themselves, but also they that desire to learn be able to profit them which are without, both by speaking and writing: my grandfather Jesus, when he had much given himself to the reading of the law, and the prophets, and other books of our fathers, and had gotten therein good judgment, was drawn on also himself to write something pertaining to learning and wisdom; to the intent that those which are desirous to learn, and are addicted to these things, might profit much more in living according to the law. Wherefore let me intreat you to read it with favour and attention, and to pardon us, wherein we may seem to come short of some words, which we have laboured to interpret. For the same things uttered in Hebrew, and translated into another tongue, have not the same force in them: and not only these things, but the law itself, and the prophets, and the rest of the books, have no small difference, when they are spoken in their own language. For in the eight and thirtieth year coming into Egypt, when Euergetes was king, and continuing there some time, I found a book of no small learning: therefore I thought it most necessary for me to bestow some diligence and travail to interpret it; using great watchfulness and skill in that space to bring the book to an end, and set it forth for them also, which in a strange country are willing to learn, being prepared before in manners to live after the law.</span>
