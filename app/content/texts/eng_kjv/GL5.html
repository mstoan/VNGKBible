<div class="c">5</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_1" data-id="GL5_1">Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_2" data-id="GL5_2">Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_3" data-id="GL5_3">For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_4" data-id="GL5_4">Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_5" data-id="GL5_5">For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_6" data-id="GL5_6">For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_7" data-id="GL5_7">Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_8" data-id="GL5_8">This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_9" data-id="GL5_9">A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_10" data-id="GL5_10">I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_11" data-id="GL5_11">And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_12" data-id="GL5_12">I would they were even cut off which trouble you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_13" data-id="GL5_13">For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_14" data-id="GL5_14">For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_15" data-id="GL5_15">But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_16" data-id="GL5_16">This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulful the lust of the flesh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_17" data-id="GL5_17">For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_18" data-id="GL5_18">But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_19" data-id="GL5_19">Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_20" data-id="GL5_20">Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_21" data-id="GL5_21">Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_22" data-id="GL5_22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_23" data-id="GL5_23">Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_24" data-id="GL5_24">And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_25" data-id="GL5_25">If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_26" data-id="GL5_26">Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.</span>
