<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT5_5" data-id="DT5_5">(I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to shew you the work of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT5_6" data-id="DT5_6">I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.</span>

<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT5_27" data-id="DT5_27">Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT5_28" data-id="DT5_28">And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT5_29" data-id="DT5_29">O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!</span>

<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT5_32" data-id="DT5_32">Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT5_33" data-id="DT5_33">Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.</span>
