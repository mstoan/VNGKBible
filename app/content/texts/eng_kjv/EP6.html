<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_2" data-id="EP6_2">Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_3" data-id="EP6_3">That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_4" data-id="EP6_4">And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_5" data-id="EP6_5">Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_6" data-id="EP6_6">Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_7" data-id="EP6_7">With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_8" data-id="EP6_8">Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_9" data-id="EP6_9">And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_10" data-id="EP6_10">Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_11" data-id="EP6_11">Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_12" data-id="EP6_12">For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_13" data-id="EP6_13">Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_14" data-id="EP6_14">Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_15" data-id="EP6_15">And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_16" data-id="EP6_16">Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_17" data-id="EP6_17">And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_18" data-id="EP6_18">Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_19" data-id="EP6_19">And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_20" data-id="EP6_20">For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_21" data-id="EP6_21">But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_22" data-id="EP6_22">Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_23" data-id="EP6_23">Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_24" data-id="EP6_24">Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.</span>
