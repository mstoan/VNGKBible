<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_4" data-id="PR1_4">To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_5" data-id="PR1_5">A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_6" data-id="PR1_6">To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_7" data-id="PR1_7">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_9" data-id="PR1_9">For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</span>

<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_21" data-id="PR1_21">She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_22" data-id="PR1_22">How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</span>

<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_26" data-id="PR1_26">I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_27" data-id="PR1_27">When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_28" data-id="PR1_28">Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_29" data-id="PR1_29">For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_30" data-id="PR1_30">They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_31" data-id="PR1_31">Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_32" data-id="PR1_32">For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_33" data-id="PR1_33">But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</span>
