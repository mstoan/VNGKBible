<div class="c">58</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_1" data-id="IS58_1">Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_2" data-id="IS58_2">Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_3" data-id="IS58_3">Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_4" data-id="IS58_4">Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_5" data-id="IS58_5">Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_6" data-id="IS58_6">Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_7" data-id="IS58_7">Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_8" data-id="IS58_8">Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rereward.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_9" data-id="IS58_9">Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_10" data-id="IS58_10">And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noonday:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_11" data-id="IS58_11">And the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_12" data-id="IS58_12">And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_13" data-id="IS58_13">If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_14" data-id="IS58_14">Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.</span>
