<div class="c">2</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_1" data-id="RM2_1">Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_2" data-id="RM2_2">But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_3" data-id="RM2_3">And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_4" data-id="RM2_4">Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_5" data-id="RM2_5">But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_6" data-id="RM2_6">Who will render to every man according to his deeds:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_7" data-id="RM2_7">To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_8" data-id="RM2_8">But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_9" data-id="RM2_9">Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_10" data-id="RM2_10">But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_11" data-id="RM2_11">For there is no respect of persons with God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_12" data-id="RM2_12">For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_13" data-id="RM2_13">(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_14" data-id="RM2_14">For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_15" data-id="RM2_15">Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_16" data-id="RM2_16">In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_17" data-id="RM2_17">Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_18" data-id="RM2_18">And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_19" data-id="RM2_19">And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_20" data-id="RM2_20">An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_21" data-id="RM2_21">Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_22" data-id="RM2_22">Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_23" data-id="RM2_23">Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_24" data-id="RM2_24">For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_25" data-id="RM2_25">For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_26" data-id="RM2_26">Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_27" data-id="RM2_27">And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_28" data-id="RM2_28">For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_29" data-id="RM2_29">But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.</span>
