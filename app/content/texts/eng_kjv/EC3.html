<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_2" data-id="EC3_2">A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_3" data-id="EC3_3">A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_4" data-id="EC3_4">A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_5" data-id="EC3_5">A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_6" data-id="EC3_6">A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_7" data-id="EC3_7">A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_8" data-id="EC3_8">A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_9" data-id="EC3_9">What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_10" data-id="EC3_10">I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_11" data-id="EC3_11">He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_12" data-id="EC3_12">I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_13" data-id="EC3_13">And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_14" data-id="EC3_14">I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_15" data-id="EC3_15">That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_16" data-id="EC3_16">And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_17" data-id="EC3_17">I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_18" data-id="EC3_18">I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_19" data-id="EC3_19">For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_20" data-id="EC3_20">All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</span>
