<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_2" data-id="JB3_2">And Job spake, and said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_3" data-id="JB3_3">Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_4" data-id="JB3_4">Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_5" data-id="JB3_5">Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_6" data-id="JB3_6">As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_7" data-id="JB3_7">Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_8" data-id="JB3_8">Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_9" data-id="JB3_9">Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_10" data-id="JB3_10">Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_11" data-id="JB3_11">Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_12" data-id="JB3_12">Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_13" data-id="JB3_13">For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_14" data-id="JB3_14">With kings and counsellers of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_15" data-id="JB3_15">Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_16" data-id="JB3_16">Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_17" data-id="JB3_17">There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_18" data-id="JB3_18">There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_19" data-id="JB3_19">The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_20" data-id="JB3_20">Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_21" data-id="JB3_21">Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_22" data-id="JB3_22">Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_23" data-id="JB3_23">Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_24" data-id="JB3_24">For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_25" data-id="JB3_25">For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_26" data-id="JB3_26">I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.</span>
