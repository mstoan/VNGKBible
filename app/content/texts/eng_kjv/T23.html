<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_2" data-id="T23_2">For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_3" data-id="T23_3">Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_4" data-id="T23_4">Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_5" data-id="T23_5">Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_6" data-id="T23_6">For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_7" data-id="T23_7">Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_8" data-id="T23_8">Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_9" data-id="T23_9">But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_10" data-id="T23_10">But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_11" data-id="T23_11">Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_12" data-id="T23_12">Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_13" data-id="T23_13">But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_14" data-id="T23_14">But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_15" data-id="T23_15">And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_16" data-id="T23_16">All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_17" data-id="T23_17">That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</span>
