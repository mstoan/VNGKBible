<div class="c">6</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_1" data-id="MT6_1">Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_2" data-id="MT6_2">Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_3" data-id="MT6_3">But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_4" data-id="MT6_4">That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_5" data-id="MT6_5">And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_6" data-id="MT6_6">But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_7" data-id="MT6_7">But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_8" data-id="MT6_8">Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_9" data-id="MT6_9">After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_10" data-id="MT6_10">Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_11" data-id="MT6_11">Give us this day our daily bread.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_12" data-id="MT6_12">And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_13" data-id="MT6_13">And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_14" data-id="MT6_14">For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_15" data-id="MT6_15">But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_16" data-id="MT6_16">Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_17" data-id="MT6_17">But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_18" data-id="MT6_18">That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_19" data-id="MT6_19">Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_20" data-id="MT6_20">But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_21" data-id="MT6_21">For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_22" data-id="MT6_22">The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_23" data-id="MT6_23">But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_24" data-id="MT6_24">No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_25" data-id="MT6_25">Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_26" data-id="MT6_26">Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_27" data-id="MT6_27">Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_28" data-id="MT6_28">And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_29" data-id="MT6_29">And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_30" data-id="MT6_30">Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_31" data-id="MT6_31">Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_32" data-id="MT6_32">(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_33" data-id="MT6_33">But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_34" data-id="MT6_34">Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</span>
