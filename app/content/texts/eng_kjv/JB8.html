<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB8_4" data-id="JB8_4">If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB8_5" data-id="JB8_5">If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB8_6" data-id="JB8_6">If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB8_7" data-id="JB8_7">Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.</span>
