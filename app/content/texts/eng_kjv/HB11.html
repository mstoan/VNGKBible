<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_5" data-id="HB11_5">By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_6" data-id="HB11_6">But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_7" data-id="HB11_7">By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.</span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_10" data-id="HB11_10">For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_12" data-id="HB11_12">Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_13" data-id="HB11_13">These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_14" data-id="HB11_14">For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_15" data-id="HB11_15">And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.</span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_18" data-id="HB11_18">Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_19" data-id="HB11_19">Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.</span>

<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_26" data-id="HB11_26">Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_27" data-id="HB11_27">By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.</span>

<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_33" data-id="HB11_33">Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_34" data-id="HB11_34">Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.</span>
