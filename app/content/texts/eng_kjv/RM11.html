<div class="c">11</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_1" data-id="RM11_1">I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_2" data-id="RM11_2">God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_3" data-id="RM11_3">Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_4" data-id="RM11_4">But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_5" data-id="RM11_5">Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_6" data-id="RM11_6">And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_7" data-id="RM11_7">What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_8" data-id="RM11_8">(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_9" data-id="RM11_9">And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling block, and a recompence unto them:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_10" data-id="RM11_10">Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_11" data-id="RM11_11">I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_12" data-id="RM11_12">Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_13" data-id="RM11_13">For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_14" data-id="RM11_14">If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_15" data-id="RM11_15">For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_16" data-id="RM11_16">For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_17" data-id="RM11_17">And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_18" data-id="RM11_18">Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_19" data-id="RM11_19">Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_20" data-id="RM11_20">Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_21" data-id="RM11_21">For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_22" data-id="RM11_22">Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_23" data-id="RM11_23">And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_24" data-id="RM11_24">For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_25" data-id="RM11_25">For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_26" data-id="RM11_26">And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_27" data-id="RM11_27">For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_28" data-id="RM11_28">As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_29" data-id="RM11_29">For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_30" data-id="RM11_30">For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_31" data-id="RM11_31">Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_32" data-id="RM11_32">For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_33" data-id="RM11_33">O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_34" data-id="RM11_34">For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counseller?</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_35" data-id="RM11_35">Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_36" data-id="RM11_36">For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.</span>
