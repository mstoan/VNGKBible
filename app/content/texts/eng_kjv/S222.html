<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S222_8" data-id="S222_8">Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S222_9" data-id="S222_9">There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S222_10" data-id="S222_10">He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet.</span>

<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v S222_37" data-id="S222_37">Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v S222_38" data-id="S222_38">I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v S222_39" data-id="S222_39">And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v S222_40" data-id="S222_40">For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v S222_41" data-id="S222_41">Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.</span>
