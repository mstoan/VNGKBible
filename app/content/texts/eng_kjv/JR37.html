<div class="c">37</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR37_1" data-id="JR37_1">And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR37_2" data-id="JR37_2">But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the LORD, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR37_3" data-id="JR37_3">And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the LORD our God for us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR37_4" data-id="JR37_4">Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR37_5" data-id="JR37_5">Then Pharoah's army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR37_6" data-id="JR37_6">Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR37_7" data-id="JR37_7">Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to inquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR37_8" data-id="JR37_8">And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR37_9" data-id="JR37_9">Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR37_10" data-id="JR37_10">For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR37_11" data-id="JR37_11">And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR37_12" data-id="JR37_12">Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR37_13" data-id="JR37_13">And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR37_14" data-id="JR37_14">Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR37_15" data-id="JR37_15">Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR37_16" data-id="JR37_16">When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR37_17" data-id="JR37_17">Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR37_18" data-id="JR37_18">Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR37_19" data-id="JR37_19">Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR37_20" data-id="JR37_20">Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR37_21" data-id="JR37_21">Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.</span>
