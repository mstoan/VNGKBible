<div class="c">15</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_1" data-id="MK15_1">And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_2" data-id="MK15_2">And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_3" data-id="MK15_3">And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_4" data-id="MK15_4">And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_5" data-id="MK15_5">But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_6" data-id="MK15_6">Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_7" data-id="MK15_7">And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_8" data-id="MK15_8">And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_9" data-id="MK15_9">But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_10" data-id="MK15_10">For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_11" data-id="MK15_11">But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_12" data-id="MK15_12">And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_13" data-id="MK15_13">And they cried out again, Crucify him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_14" data-id="MK15_14">Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_15" data-id="MK15_15">And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_16" data-id="MK15_16">And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_17" data-id="MK15_17">And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_18" data-id="MK15_18">And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_19" data-id="MK15_19">And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_20" data-id="MK15_20">And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_21" data-id="MK15_21">And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_22" data-id="MK15_22">And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_23" data-id="MK15_23">And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_24" data-id="MK15_24">And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_25" data-id="MK15_25">And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_26" data-id="MK15_26">And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_27" data-id="MK15_27">And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_28" data-id="MK15_28">And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_29" data-id="MK15_29">And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_30" data-id="MK15_30">Save thyself, and come down from the cross.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_31" data-id="MK15_31">Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_32" data-id="MK15_32">Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_33" data-id="MK15_33">And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_34" data-id="MK15_34">And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_35" data-id="MK15_35">And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_36" data-id="MK15_36">And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_37" data-id="MK15_37">And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_38" data-id="MK15_38">And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_39" data-id="MK15_39">And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_40" data-id="MK15_40">There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_41" data-id="MK15_41">(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_42" data-id="MK15_42">And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_43" data-id="MK15_43">Joseph of Arimathaea, and honourable counseller, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_44" data-id="MK15_44">And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_45" data-id="MK15_45">And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_46" data-id="MK15_46">And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_47" data-id="MK15_47">And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.</span>
