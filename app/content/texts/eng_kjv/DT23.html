<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT23_4" data-id="DT23_4">Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT23_5" data-id="DT23_5">Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but the LORD thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because the LORD thy God loved thee.</span>

<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT23_21" data-id="DT23_21">When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay it: for the LORD thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT23_22" data-id="DT23_22">But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT23_23" data-id="DT23_23">That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform; even a freewill offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the LORD thy God, which thou hast promised with thy mouth.</span>
