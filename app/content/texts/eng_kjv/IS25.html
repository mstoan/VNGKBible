<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS25_2" data-id="IS25_2">For thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS25_3" data-id="IS25_3">Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS25_4" data-id="IS25_4">For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS25_5" data-id="IS25_5">Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS25_6" data-id="IS25_6">And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.</span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS25_8" data-id="IS25_8">He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS25_9" data-id="IS25_9">And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS25_10" data-id="IS25_10">For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.</span>
