<div class="c">5</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_1" data-id="EC5_1">Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_2" data-id="EC5_2">Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_3" data-id="EC5_3">For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice is known by multitude of words.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_4" data-id="EC5_4">When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_5" data-id="EC5_5">Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_6" data-id="EC5_6">Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_7" data-id="EC5_7">For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities: but fear thou God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_8" data-id="EC5_8">If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_9" data-id="EC5_9">Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served by the field.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_10" data-id="EC5_10">He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_11" data-id="EC5_11">When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_12" data-id="EC5_12">The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_13" data-id="EC5_13">There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_14" data-id="EC5_14">But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and there is nothing in his hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_15" data-id="EC5_15">As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_16" data-id="EC5_16">And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_17" data-id="EC5_17">All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_18" data-id="EC5_18">Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it is his portion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_19" data-id="EC5_19">Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_20" data-id="EC5_20">For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart.</span>
