<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_2" data-id="JN15_2">Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_3" data-id="JN15_3">Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_4" data-id="JN15_4">Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_5" data-id="JN15_5">I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_6" data-id="JN15_6">If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_7" data-id="JN15_7">If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_8" data-id="JN15_8">Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_9" data-id="JN15_9">As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_10" data-id="JN15_10">If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_11" data-id="JN15_11">These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_12" data-id="JN15_12">This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_13" data-id="JN15_13">Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_14" data-id="JN15_14">Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_15" data-id="JN15_15">Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_16" data-id="JN15_16">Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_17" data-id="JN15_17">These things I command you, that ye love one another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_18" data-id="JN15_18">If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_19" data-id="JN15_19">If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_20" data-id="JN15_20">Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_21" data-id="JN15_21">But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_22" data-id="JN15_22">If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_23" data-id="JN15_23">He that hateth me hateth my Father also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_24" data-id="JN15_24">If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_25" data-id="JN15_25">But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_26" data-id="JN15_26">But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN15_27" data-id="JN15_27">And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.</span>
