<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_2" data-id="AM2_2">But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_3" data-id="AM2_3">And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_4" data-id="AM2_4">Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_5" data-id="AM2_5">But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_6" data-id="AM2_6">Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_7" data-id="AM2_7">That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the same maid, to profane my holy name:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_8" data-id="AM2_8">And they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_9" data-id="AM2_9">Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_10" data-id="AM2_10">Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_11" data-id="AM2_11">And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_12" data-id="AM2_12">But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_14" data-id="AM2_14">Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself:</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_15" data-id="AM2_15">Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_16" data-id="AM2_16">And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD.</span>
