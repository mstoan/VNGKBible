<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_2" data-id="JB9_2">I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_3" data-id="JB9_3">If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_4" data-id="JB9_4">He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_5" data-id="JB9_5">Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_6" data-id="JB9_6">Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_7" data-id="JB9_7">Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_8" data-id="JB9_8">Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_9" data-id="JB9_9">Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_10" data-id="JB9_10">Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_11" data-id="JB9_11">Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_12" data-id="JB9_12">Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_13" data-id="JB9_13">If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_14" data-id="JB9_14">How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_15" data-id="JB9_15">Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_16" data-id="JB9_16">If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_17" data-id="JB9_17">For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_18" data-id="JB9_18">He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_19" data-id="JB9_19">If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_20" data-id="JB9_20">If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_21" data-id="JB9_21">Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_22" data-id="JB9_22">This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_23" data-id="JB9_23">If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_24" data-id="JB9_24">The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_25" data-id="JB9_25">Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_26" data-id="JB9_26">They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_27" data-id="JB9_27">If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_28" data-id="JB9_28">I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_29" data-id="JB9_29">If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_30" data-id="JB9_30">If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_31" data-id="JB9_31">Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_32" data-id="JB9_32">For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_33" data-id="JB9_33">Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_34" data-id="JB9_34">Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_35" data-id="JB9_35">Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.</span>
