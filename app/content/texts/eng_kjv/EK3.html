<div class="c">3</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_1" data-id="EK3_1">Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_2" data-id="EK3_2">So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_3" data-id="EK3_3">And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_4" data-id="EK3_4">And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_5" data-id="EK3_5">For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_6" data-id="EK3_6">Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_7" data-id="EK3_7">But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_8" data-id="EK3_8">Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_9" data-id="EK3_9">As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_10" data-id="EK3_10">Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_11" data-id="EK3_11">And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_12" data-id="EK3_12">Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_13" data-id="EK3_13">I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_14" data-id="EK3_14">So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_15" data-id="EK3_15">Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_16" data-id="EK3_16">And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_17" data-id="EK3_17">Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_18" data-id="EK3_18">When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_19" data-id="EK3_19">Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_20" data-id="EK3_20">Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_21" data-id="EK3_21">Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_22" data-id="EK3_22">And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_23" data-id="EK3_23">Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_24" data-id="EK3_24">Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_25" data-id="EK3_25">But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_26" data-id="EK3_26">And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_27" data-id="EK3_27">But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.</span>
