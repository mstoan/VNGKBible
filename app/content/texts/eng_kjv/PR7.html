<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_2" data-id="PR7_2">Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_3" data-id="PR7_3">Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_4" data-id="PR7_4">Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_5" data-id="PR7_5">That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_6" data-id="PR7_6">For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_7" data-id="PR7_7">And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_8" data-id="PR7_8">Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_9" data-id="PR7_9">In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_10" data-id="PR7_10">And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_11" data-id="PR7_11">(She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_12" data-id="PR7_12">Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_13" data-id="PR7_13">So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_14" data-id="PR7_14">I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_15" data-id="PR7_15">Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_16" data-id="PR7_16">I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_17" data-id="PR7_17">I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_18" data-id="PR7_18">Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_19" data-id="PR7_19">For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_20" data-id="PR7_20">He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_21" data-id="PR7_21">With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_22" data-id="PR7_22">He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_23" data-id="PR7_23">Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_24" data-id="PR7_24">Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_25" data-id="PR7_25">Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_26" data-id="PR7_26">For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR7_27" data-id="PR7_27">Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.</span>
