<div class="c">17</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS17_1" data-id="WS17_1">For great are thy judgments, and cannot be expressed: therefore unnurtured souls have erred.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS17_2" data-id="WS17_2">For when unrighteous men thought to oppress the holy nation; they being shut up in their houses, the prisoners of darkness, and fettered with the bonds of a long night, lay [there] exiled from the eternal providence.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS17_3" data-id="WS17_3">For while they supposed to lie hid in their secret sins, they were scattered under a dark veil of forgetfulness, being horribly astonished, and troubled with [strange] apparitions.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS17_4" data-id="WS17_4">For neither might the corner that held them keep them from fear: but noises [as of waters] falling down sounded about them, and sad visions appeared unto them with heavy countenances.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS17_5" data-id="WS17_5">No power of the fire might give them light: neither could the bright flames of the stars endure to lighten that horrible night.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS17_6" data-id="WS17_6">Only there appeared unto them a fire kindled of itself, very dreadful: for being much terrified, they thought the things which they saw to be worse than the sight they saw not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS17_7" data-id="WS17_7">As for the illusions of art magick, they were put down, and their vaunting in wisdom was reproved with disgrace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS17_8" data-id="WS17_8">For they, that promised to drive away terrors and troubles from a sick soul, were sick themselves of fear, worthy to be laughed at.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS17_9" data-id="WS17_9">For though no terrible thing did fear them; yet being scared with beasts that passed by, and hissing of serpents,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS17_10" data-id="WS17_10">They died for fear, denying that they saw the air, which could of no side be avoided.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS17_11" data-id="WS17_11">For wickedness, condemned by her own witness, is very timorous, and being pressed with conscience, always forecasteth grievous things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS17_12" data-id="WS17_12">For fear is nothing else but a betraying of the succours which reason offereth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS17_13" data-id="WS17_13">And the expectation from within, being less, counteth the ignorance more than the cause which bringeth the torment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS17_14" data-id="WS17_14">But they sleeping the same sleep that night, which was indeed intolerable, and which came upon them out of the bottoms of inevitable hell,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS17_15" data-id="WS17_15">Were partly vexed with monstrous apparitions, and partly fainted, their heart failing them: for a sudden fear, and not looked for, came upon them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS17_16" data-id="WS17_16">So then whosoever there fell down was straitly kept, shut up in a prison without iron bars,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS17_17" data-id="WS17_17">For whether he were husbandman, or shepherd, or a labourer in the field, he was overtaken, and endured that necessity, which could not be avoided: for they were all bound with one chain of darkness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS17_18" data-id="WS17_18">Whether it were a whistling wind, or a melodious noise of birds among the spreading branches, or a pleasing fall of water running violently,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS17_19" data-id="WS17_19">Or a terrible sound of stones cast down, or a running that could not be seen of skipping beasts, or a roaring voice of most savage wild beasts, or a rebounding echo from the hollow mountains; these things made them to swoon for fear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS17_20" data-id="WS17_20">For the whole world shined with clear light, and none were hindered in their labour:</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS17_21" data-id="WS17_21">Over them only was spread an heavy night, an image of that darkness which should afterward receive them: but yet were they unto themselves more grievous than the darkness.</span>
