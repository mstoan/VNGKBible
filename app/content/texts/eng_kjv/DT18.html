<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT18_2" data-id="DT18_2">Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren: the LORD is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT18_3" data-id="DT18_3">And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT18_4" data-id="DT18_4">The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT18_5" data-id="DT18_5">For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT18_6" data-id="DT18_6">And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the LORD shall choose;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT18_7" data-id="DT18_7">Then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, which stand there before the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT18_8" data-id="DT18_8">They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT18_9" data-id="DT18_9">When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT18_10" data-id="DT18_10">There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT18_11" data-id="DT18_11">Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT18_12" data-id="DT18_12">For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD: and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT18_13" data-id="DT18_13">Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT18_14" data-id="DT18_14">For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so to do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT18_15" data-id="DT18_15">The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT18_16" data-id="DT18_16">According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT18_17" data-id="DT18_17">And the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which they have spoken.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT18_18" data-id="DT18_18">I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT18_19" data-id="DT18_19">And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT18_20" data-id="DT18_20">But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT18_21" data-id="DT18_21">And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the LORD hath not spoken?</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT18_22" data-id="DT18_22">When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.</span>
