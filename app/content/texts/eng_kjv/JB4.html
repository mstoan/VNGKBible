<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB4_2" data-id="JB4_2">If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB4_3" data-id="JB4_3">Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB4_4" data-id="JB4_4">Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB4_5" data-id="JB4_5">But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB4_6" data-id="JB4_6">Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB4_7" data-id="JB4_7">Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB4_8" data-id="JB4_8">Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB4_9" data-id="JB4_9">By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB4_10" data-id="JB4_10">The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB4_11" data-id="JB4_11">The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB4_12" data-id="JB4_12">Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB4_13" data-id="JB4_13">In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB4_14" data-id="JB4_14">Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB4_15" data-id="JB4_15">Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB4_16" data-id="JB4_16">It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB4_17" data-id="JB4_17">Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?</span>
