<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV6_4" data-id="RV6_4">And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV6_5" data-id="RV6_5">And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV6_6" data-id="RV6_6">And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV6_7" data-id="RV6_7">And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV6_8" data-id="RV6_8">And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV6_9" data-id="RV6_9">And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV6_10" data-id="RV6_10">And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?</span>
