<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR25_2" data-id="JR25_2">The which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR25_3" data-id="JR25_3">From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even unto this day, that is the three and twentieth year, the word of the LORD hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR25_4" data-id="JR25_4">And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending them; but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR25_5" data-id="JR25_5">They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR25_6" data-id="JR25_6">And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR25_7" data-id="JR25_7">Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the LORD; that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR25_8" data-id="JR25_8">Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Because ye have not heard my words,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR25_9" data-id="JR25_9">Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR25_10" data-id="JR25_10">Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle.</span>

<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR25_30" data-id="JR25_30">Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR25_31" data-id="JR25_31">A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the LORD hath a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the LORD.</span>
