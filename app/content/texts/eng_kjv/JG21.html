<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_6" data-id="JG21_6">And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_9" data-id="JG21_9">For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_10" data-id="JG21_10">And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_16" data-id="JG21_16">Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_17" data-id="JG21_17">And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_18" data-id="JG21_18">Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_19" data-id="JG21_19">Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_20" data-id="JG21_20">Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_21" data-id="JG21_21">And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_22" data-id="JG21_22">And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, that ye should be guilty.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_23" data-id="JG21_23">And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_24" data-id="JG21_24">And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_25" data-id="JG21_25">In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.</span>
