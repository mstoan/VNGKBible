<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS6_2" data-id="HS6_2">After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS6_3" data-id="HS6_3">Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS6_4" data-id="HS6_4">O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS6_5" data-id="HS6_5">Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS6_6" data-id="HS6_6">For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.</span>
