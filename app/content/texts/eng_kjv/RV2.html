<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_2" data-id="RV2_2">I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_3" data-id="RV2_3">And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_4" data-id="RV2_4">Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_5" data-id="RV2_5">Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_6" data-id="RV2_6">But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_7" data-id="RV2_7">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_8" data-id="RV2_8">And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_9" data-id="RV2_9">I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_10" data-id="RV2_10">Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_11" data-id="RV2_11">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_12" data-id="RV2_12">And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_13" data-id="RV2_13">I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_14" data-id="RV2_14">But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_15" data-id="RV2_15">So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_16" data-id="RV2_16">Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_17" data-id="RV2_17">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_18" data-id="RV2_18">And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_19" data-id="RV2_19">I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_20" data-id="RV2_20">Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_21" data-id="RV2_21">And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_22" data-id="RV2_22">Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_23" data-id="RV2_23">And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_24" data-id="RV2_24">But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_25" data-id="RV2_25">But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_26" data-id="RV2_26">And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_27" data-id="RV2_27">And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_28" data-id="RV2_28">And I will give him the morning star.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_29" data-id="RV2_29">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</span>
