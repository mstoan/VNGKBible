<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_2" data-id="IS48_2">For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_3" data-id="IS48_3">I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did them suddenly, and they came to pass.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_4" data-id="IS48_4">Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_5" data-id="IS48_5">I have even from the beginning declared it to thee; before it came to pass I shewed it thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_6" data-id="IS48_6">Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it? I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_7" data-id="IS48_7">They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_8" data-id="IS48_8">Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_9" data-id="IS48_9">For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_10" data-id="IS48_10">Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_11" data-id="IS48_11">For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_12" data-id="IS48_12">Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_13" data-id="IS48_13">Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_14" data-id="IS48_14">All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared these things? The LORD hath loved him: he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_15" data-id="IS48_15">I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_16" data-id="IS48_16">Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_17" data-id="IS48_17">Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_18" data-id="IS48_18">O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_19" data-id="IS48_19">Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_20" data-id="IS48_20">Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant Jacob.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_21" data-id="IS48_21">And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_22" data-id="IS48_22">There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.</span>
