<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_2" data-id="MT25_2">And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_3" data-id="MT25_3">They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_4" data-id="MT25_4">But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_5" data-id="MT25_5">While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_6" data-id="MT25_6">And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_7" data-id="MT25_7">Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_8" data-id="MT25_8">And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_9" data-id="MT25_9">But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_10" data-id="MT25_10">And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_11" data-id="MT25_11">Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_12" data-id="MT25_12">But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_13" data-id="MT25_13">Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_14" data-id="MT25_14">For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_15" data-id="MT25_15">And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_16" data-id="MT25_16">Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_17" data-id="MT25_17">And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_18" data-id="MT25_18">But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_19" data-id="MT25_19">After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_20" data-id="MT25_20">And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_21" data-id="MT25_21">His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_22" data-id="MT25_22">He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_23" data-id="MT25_23">His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_24" data-id="MT25_24">Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_25" data-id="MT25_25">And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_26" data-id="MT25_26">His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_27" data-id="MT25_27">Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_28" data-id="MT25_28">Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_29" data-id="MT25_29">For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_30" data-id="MT25_30">And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_31" data-id="MT25_31">When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_32" data-id="MT25_32">And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_33" data-id="MT25_33">And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_34" data-id="MT25_34">Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_35" data-id="MT25_35">For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_36" data-id="MT25_36">Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_37" data-id="MT25_37">Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_38" data-id="MT25_38">When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_39" data-id="MT25_39">Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_40" data-id="MT25_40">And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_41" data-id="MT25_41">Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_42" data-id="MT25_42">For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_43" data-id="MT25_43">I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_44" data-id="MT25_44">Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_45" data-id="MT25_45">Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_46" data-id="MT25_46">And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</span>
