<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_2" data-id="T11_2">Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_3" data-id="T11_3">As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_4" data-id="T11_4">Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_5" data-id="T11_5">Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_6" data-id="T11_6">From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_7" data-id="T11_7">Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_8" data-id="T11_8">But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_9" data-id="T11_9">Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_10" data-id="T11_10">For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_11" data-id="T11_11">According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_12" data-id="T11_12">And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_13" data-id="T11_13">Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_14" data-id="T11_14">And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_15" data-id="T11_15">This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_16" data-id="T11_16">Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_17" data-id="T11_17">Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_18" data-id="T11_18">This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_19" data-id="T11_19">Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_20" data-id="T11_20">Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</span>
