<div class="c">9</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_1" data-id="C19_1">Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_2" data-id="C19_2">If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_3" data-id="C19_3">Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_4" data-id="C19_4">Have we not power to eat and to drink?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_5" data-id="C19_5">Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_6" data-id="C19_6">Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_7" data-id="C19_7">Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_8" data-id="C19_8">Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_9" data-id="C19_9">For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_10" data-id="C19_10">Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_11" data-id="C19_11">If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_12" data-id="C19_12">If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_13" data-id="C19_13">Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the alter are partakers with the alter?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_14" data-id="C19_14">Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_15" data-id="C19_15">But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_16" data-id="C19_16">For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_17" data-id="C19_17">For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_18" data-id="C19_18">What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_19" data-id="C19_19">For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_20" data-id="C19_20">And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_21" data-id="C19_21">To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_22" data-id="C19_22">To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_23" data-id="C19_23">And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_24" data-id="C19_24">Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_25" data-id="C19_25">And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_26" data-id="C19_26">I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_27" data-id="C19_27">But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.</span>
