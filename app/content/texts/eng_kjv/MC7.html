<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_2" data-id="MC7_2">The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_3" data-id="MC7_3">That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_4" data-id="MC7_4">The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_5" data-id="MC7_5">Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_6" data-id="MC7_6">For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_7" data-id="MC7_7">Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_8" data-id="MC7_8">Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_9" data-id="MC7_9">I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_10" data-id="MC7_10">Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_11" data-id="MC7_11">In the day that thy walls are to be built, in that day shall the decree be far removed.</span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_13" data-id="MC7_13">Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_14" data-id="MC7_14">Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_15" data-id="MC7_15">According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_16" data-id="MC7_16">The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deaf.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_17" data-id="MC7_17">They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_18" data-id="MC7_18">Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_19" data-id="MC7_19">He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_20" data-id="MC7_20">Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.</span>
