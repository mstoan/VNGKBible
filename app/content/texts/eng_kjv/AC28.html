<div class="c">28</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_1" data-id="AC28_1">And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_2" data-id="AC28_2">And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_3" data-id="AC28_3">And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_4" data-id="AC28_4">And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_5" data-id="AC28_5">And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_6" data-id="AC28_6">Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_7" data-id="AC28_7">In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_8" data-id="AC28_8">And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_9" data-id="AC28_9">So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_10" data-id="AC28_10">Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_11" data-id="AC28_11">And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_12" data-id="AC28_12">And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_13" data-id="AC28_13">And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_14" data-id="AC28_14">Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_15" data-id="AC28_15">And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appiiforum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_16" data-id="AC28_16">And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_17" data-id="AC28_17">And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_18" data-id="AC28_18">Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_19" data-id="AC28_19">But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_20" data-id="AC28_20">For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_21" data-id="AC28_21">And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_22" data-id="AC28_22">But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_23" data-id="AC28_23">And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_24" data-id="AC28_24">And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_25" data-id="AC28_25">And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_26" data-id="AC28_26">Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_27" data-id="AC28_27">For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_28" data-id="AC28_28">Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_29" data-id="AC28_29">And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_30" data-id="AC28_30">And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_31" data-id="AC28_31">Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.</span>
