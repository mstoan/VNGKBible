<div class="c">14</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_1" data-id="R214_1">So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_2" data-id="R214_2">And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_3" data-id="R214_3">For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_4" data-id="R214_4">And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_5" data-id="R214_5">Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_6" data-id="R214_6">And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_7" data-id="R214_7">Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_8" data-id="R214_8">And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_9" data-id="R214_9">And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_10" data-id="R214_10">Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_11" data-id="R214_11">And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_12" data-id="R214_12">So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_13" data-id="R214_13">And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_14" data-id="R214_14">And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_15" data-id="R214_15">They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.</span>
