<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS40_2" data-id="PS40_2">He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS40_3" data-id="PS40_3">And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS40_4" data-id="PS40_4">Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS40_5" data-id="PS40_5">Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS40_6" data-id="PS40_6">Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS40_7" data-id="PS40_7">Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS40_8" data-id="PS40_8">I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS40_9" data-id="PS40_9">I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS40_10" data-id="PS40_10">I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS40_11" data-id="PS40_11">Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS40_12" data-id="PS40_12">For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS40_13" data-id="PS40_13">Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS40_14" data-id="PS40_14">Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS40_15" data-id="PS40_15">Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS40_16" data-id="PS40_16">Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.</span>
