<div class="c">13</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_1" data-id="RM13_1">Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_2" data-id="RM13_2">Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_3" data-id="RM13_3">For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_4" data-id="RM13_4">For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_5" data-id="RM13_5">Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_6" data-id="RM13_6">For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_7" data-id="RM13_7">Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_8" data-id="RM13_8">Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_9" data-id="RM13_9">For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_10" data-id="RM13_10">Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_11" data-id="RM13_11">And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_12" data-id="RM13_12">The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_13" data-id="RM13_13">Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_14" data-id="RM13_14">But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.</span>
