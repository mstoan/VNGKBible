<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_9" data-id="MK3_9">And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_10" data-id="MK3_10">For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_11" data-id="MK3_11">And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.</span>
