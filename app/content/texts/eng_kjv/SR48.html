<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR48_6" data-id="SR48_6">Who broughtest kings to destruction, and honorable men from their bed:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR48_7" data-id="SR48_7">Who heardest the rebuke of the Lord in Sinai, and in Horeb the judgment of vengeance:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR48_8" data-id="SR48_8">Who annointedst kings to take revenge, and prophets to succeed after him:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR48_9" data-id="SR48_9">Who was taken up in a whirlwind of fire, and in a chariot of fiery horses:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR48_10" data-id="SR48_10">Who wast ordained for reproofs in their times, to pacify the wrath of the Lord's judgment, before it brake forth into fury, and to turn the heart of the father unto the son, and to restore the tribes of Jacob.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR48_11" data-id="SR48_11">Blessed are they that saw thee, and slept in love; for we shall surely live.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR48_12" data-id="SR48_12">Elias it was, who was covered with a whirlwind: and Eliseus was filled with his spirit: whilst he lived, he was not moved with the presence of any prince, neither could any bring him into subjection.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR48_13" data-id="SR48_13">No word could overcome him; and after his death his body prophesied.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR48_16" data-id="SR48_16">Of whom some did that which was pleasing to God, and some multiplied sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR48_17" data-id="SR48_17">Ezekias fortified his city, and brought in water into the midst thereof: he digged the hard rock with iron, and made wells for waters.</span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR48_22" data-id="SR48_22">For Ezekias had done the thing that pleased the Lord, and was strong in the ways of David his father, as Esay the prophet, who was great and faithful in his vision, had commanded him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR48_23" data-id="SR48_23">In his time the sun went backward, and he lengthened the king's life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR48_24" data-id="SR48_24">He saw by an excellent spirit what should come to pass at the last, and he comforted them that mourned in Sion.</span>
