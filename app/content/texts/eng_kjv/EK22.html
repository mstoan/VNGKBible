<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_25" data-id="EK22_25">There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_26" data-id="EK22_26">Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_27" data-id="EK22_27">Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.</span>
