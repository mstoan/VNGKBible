<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV6_3" data-id="LV6_3">Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV6_4" data-id="LV6_4">Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found,</span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV6_10" data-id="LV6_10">And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.</span>
