<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV12_2" data-id="LV12_2">Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV12_3" data-id="LV12_3">And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV12_4" data-id="LV12_4">And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV12_5" data-id="LV12_5">But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV12_7" data-id="LV12_7">Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is the law for her that hath born a male or a female.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV12_8" data-id="LV12_8">And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.</span>
