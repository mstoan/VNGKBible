<div class="c">10</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_1" data-id="JR10_1">Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_2" data-id="JR10_2">Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_3" data-id="JR10_3">For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_4" data-id="JR10_4">They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_5" data-id="JR10_5">They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_6" data-id="JR10_6">Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_7" data-id="JR10_7">Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_8" data-id="JR10_8">But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_9" data-id="JR10_9">Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_10" data-id="JR10_10">But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_11" data-id="JR10_11">Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_12" data-id="JR10_12">He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_13" data-id="JR10_13">When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_14" data-id="JR10_14">Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_15" data-id="JR10_15">They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_16" data-id="JR10_16">The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts is his name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_17" data-id="JR10_17">Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_18" data-id="JR10_18">For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find it so.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_19" data-id="JR10_19">Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_20" data-id="JR10_20">My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_21" data-id="JR10_21">For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_22" data-id="JR10_22">Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_23" data-id="JR10_23">O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_24" data-id="JR10_24">O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_25" data-id="JR10_25">Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.</span>
