<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_2" data-id="HK1_2">O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_3" data-id="HK1_3">Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_4" data-id="HK1_4">Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_5" data-id="HK1_5">Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for I will work a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though it be told you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_6" data-id="HK1_6">For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_7" data-id="HK1_7">They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_8" data-id="HK1_8">Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_9" data-id="HK1_9">They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_10" data-id="HK1_10">And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_11" data-id="HK1_11">Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, imputing this his power unto his god.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_12" data-id="HK1_12">Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_13" data-id="HK1_13">Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_14" data-id="HK1_14">And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_15" data-id="HK1_15">They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_16" data-id="HK1_16">Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_17" data-id="HK1_17">Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?</span>
