<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_2" data-id="C110_2">And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_3" data-id="C110_3">And did all eat the same spiritual meat;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_4" data-id="C110_4">And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_5" data-id="C110_5">But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_6" data-id="C110_6">Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.</span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_8" data-id="C110_8">Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_9" data-id="C110_9">Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.</span>

<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_21" data-id="C110_21">Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_22" data-id="C110_22">Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_23" data-id="C110_23">All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.</span>

<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_29" data-id="C110_29">Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_30" data-id="C110_30">For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_31" data-id="C110_31">Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_32" data-id="C110_32">Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_33" data-id="C110_33">Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.</span>
