<div class="c">7</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_1" data-id="AM7_1">Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_2" data-id="AM7_2">And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_3" data-id="AM7_3">The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_4" data-id="AM7_4">Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_5" data-id="AM7_5">Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_6" data-id="AM7_6">The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_7" data-id="AM7_7">Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_8" data-id="AM7_8">And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_9" data-id="AM7_9">And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_10" data-id="AM7_10">Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_11" data-id="AM7_11">For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_12" data-id="AM7_12">Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_13" data-id="AM7_13">But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the king's chapel, and it is the king's court.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_14" data-id="AM7_14">Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_15" data-id="AM7_15">And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_16" data-id="AM7_16">Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_17" data-id="AM7_17">Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.</span>
