<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_8" data-id="AC14_8">And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_9" data-id="AC14_9">The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_10" data-id="AC14_10">Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_15" data-id="AC14_15">And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_16" data-id="AC14_16">Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_17" data-id="AC14_17">Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.</span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_22" data-id="AC14_22">Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_23" data-id="AC14_23">And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.</span>
