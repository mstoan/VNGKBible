<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU21_4" data-id="NU21_4">And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU21_5" data-id="NU21_5">And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU21_6" data-id="NU21_6">And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU21_7" data-id="NU21_7">Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU21_8" data-id="NU21_8">And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU21_15" data-id="NU21_15">And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.</span>

<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU21_19" data-id="NU21_19">And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU21_20" data-id="NU21_20">And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU21_21" data-id="NU21_21">And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU21_22" data-id="NU21_22">Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but we will go along by the king's high way, until we be past thy borders.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU21_23" data-id="NU21_23">And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU21_24" data-id="NU21_24">And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU21_25" data-id="NU21_25">And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU21_26" data-id="NU21_26">For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU21_27" data-id="NU21_27">Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU21_28" data-id="NU21_28">For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU21_29" data-id="NU21_29">Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU21_30" data-id="NU21_30">We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU21_31" data-id="NU21_31">Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU21_32" data-id="NU21_32">And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU21_33" data-id="NU21_33">And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU21_34" data-id="NU21_34">And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU21_35" data-id="NU21_35">So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.</span>
