<div class="c">3</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_1" data-id="RM3_1">What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_2" data-id="RM3_2">Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_3" data-id="RM3_3">For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_4" data-id="RM3_4">God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_5" data-id="RM3_5">But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_6" data-id="RM3_6">God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_7" data-id="RM3_7">For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_8" data-id="RM3_8">And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_9" data-id="RM3_9">What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_10" data-id="RM3_10">As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_11" data-id="RM3_11">There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_12" data-id="RM3_12">They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_13" data-id="RM3_13">Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_14" data-id="RM3_14">Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_15" data-id="RM3_15">Their feet are swift to shed blood:</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_16" data-id="RM3_16">Destruction and misery are in their ways:</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_17" data-id="RM3_17">And the way of peace have they not known:</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_18" data-id="RM3_18">There is no fear of God before their eyes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_19" data-id="RM3_19">Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_20" data-id="RM3_20">Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_21" data-id="RM3_21">But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_22" data-id="RM3_22">Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_23" data-id="RM3_23">For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_24" data-id="RM3_24">Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_25" data-id="RM3_25">Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_26" data-id="RM3_26">To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_27" data-id="RM3_27">Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_28" data-id="RM3_28">Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_29" data-id="RM3_29">Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_30" data-id="RM3_30">Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_31" data-id="RM3_31">Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.</span>
