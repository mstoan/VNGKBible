<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_2" data-id="P15_2">Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_3" data-id="P15_3">Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_4" data-id="P15_4">And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_5" data-id="P15_5">Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_6" data-id="P15_6">Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_7" data-id="P15_7">Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_8" data-id="P15_8">Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_9" data-id="P15_9">Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_10" data-id="P15_10">But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_11" data-id="P15_11">To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_12" data-id="P15_12">By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_13" data-id="P15_13">The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_14" data-id="P15_14">Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.</span>
