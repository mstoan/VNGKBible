<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_10" data-id="LV9_10">But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_17" data-id="LV9_17">And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_18" data-id="LV9_18">He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_19" data-id="LV9_19">And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_20" data-id="LV9_20">And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_21" data-id="LV9_21">And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_22" data-id="LV9_22">And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_23" data-id="LV9_23">And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_24" data-id="LV9_24">And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.</span>
