<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC1_2" data-id="EC1_2">Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC1_3" data-id="EC1_3">What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC1_4" data-id="EC1_4">One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC1_5" data-id="EC1_5">The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC1_6" data-id="EC1_6">The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC1_7" data-id="EC1_7">All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC1_8" data-id="EC1_8">All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC1_9" data-id="EC1_9">The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC1_11" data-id="EC1_11">There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC1_12" data-id="EC1_12">I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC1_13" data-id="EC1_13">And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC1_14" data-id="EC1_14">I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC1_16" data-id="EC1_16">I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC1_17" data-id="EC1_17">And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</span>
