<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK19_2" data-id="EK19_2">And say, What is thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK19_3" data-id="EK19_3">And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK19_4" data-id="EK19_4">The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK19_5" data-id="EK19_5">Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK19_6" data-id="EK19_6">And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, and devoured men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK19_7" data-id="EK19_7">And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, by the noise of his roaring.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK19_8" data-id="EK19_8">Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and spread their net over him: he was taken in their pit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK19_9" data-id="EK19_9">And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon: they brought him into holds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK19_10" data-id="EK19_10">Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK19_11" data-id="EK19_11">And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK19_12" data-id="EK19_12">But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK19_13" data-id="EK19_13">And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK19_14" data-id="EK19_14">And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath devoured her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.</span>
