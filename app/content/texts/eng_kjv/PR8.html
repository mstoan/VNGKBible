<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR8_3" data-id="PR8_3">She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR8_4" data-id="PR8_4">Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.</span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR8_13" data-id="PR8_13">The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.</span>

<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR8_27" data-id="PR8_27">When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR8_28" data-id="PR8_28">When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR8_29" data-id="PR8_29">When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR8_30" data-id="PR8_30">Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;</span>

<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR8_34" data-id="PR8_34">Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR8_35" data-id="PR8_35">For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR8_36" data-id="PR8_36">But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.</span>
