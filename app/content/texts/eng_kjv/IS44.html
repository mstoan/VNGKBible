<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_17" data-id="IS44_17">And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_18" data-id="IS44_18">They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_19" data-id="IS44_19">And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?</span>
