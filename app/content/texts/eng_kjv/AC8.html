<div class="c">8</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_1" data-id="AC8_1">And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_2" data-id="AC8_2">And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_3" data-id="AC8_3">As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_4" data-id="AC8_4">Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_5" data-id="AC8_5">Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_6" data-id="AC8_6">And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_7" data-id="AC8_7">For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_8" data-id="AC8_8">And there was great joy in that city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_9" data-id="AC8_9">But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_10" data-id="AC8_10">To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_11" data-id="AC8_11">And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_12" data-id="AC8_12">But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_13" data-id="AC8_13">Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_14" data-id="AC8_14">Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_15" data-id="AC8_15">Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_16" data-id="AC8_16">(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_17" data-id="AC8_17">Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_18" data-id="AC8_18">And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_19" data-id="AC8_19">Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_20" data-id="AC8_20">But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_21" data-id="AC8_21">Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_22" data-id="AC8_22">Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_23" data-id="AC8_23">For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_24" data-id="AC8_24">Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_25" data-id="AC8_25">And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_26" data-id="AC8_26">And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_27" data-id="AC8_27">And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_28" data-id="AC8_28">Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_29" data-id="AC8_29">Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_30" data-id="AC8_30">And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_31" data-id="AC8_31">And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_32" data-id="AC8_32">The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_33" data-id="AC8_33">In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_34" data-id="AC8_34">And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_35" data-id="AC8_35">Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_36" data-id="AC8_36">And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_37" data-id="AC8_37">And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_38" data-id="AC8_38">And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_39" data-id="AC8_39">And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_40" data-id="AC8_40">But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</span>
