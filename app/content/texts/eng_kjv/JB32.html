<div class="c">32</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_1" data-id="JB32_1">So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_2" data-id="JB32_2">Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_3" data-id="JB32_3">Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_4" data-id="JB32_4">Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_5" data-id="JB32_5">When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_6" data-id="JB32_6">And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_7" data-id="JB32_7">I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_8" data-id="JB32_8">But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_9" data-id="JB32_9">Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_10" data-id="JB32_10">Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_11" data-id="JB32_11">Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_12" data-id="JB32_12">Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_13" data-id="JB32_13">Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_14" data-id="JB32_14">Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_15" data-id="JB32_15">They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_16" data-id="JB32_16">When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_17" data-id="JB32_17">I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_18" data-id="JB32_18">For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_19" data-id="JB32_19">Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_20" data-id="JB32_20">I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_21" data-id="JB32_21">Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_22" data-id="JB32_22">For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.</span>
