<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR5_2" data-id="PR5_2">That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR5_3" data-id="PR5_3">For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR5_4" data-id="PR5_4">But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR5_5" data-id="PR5_5">Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR5_6" data-id="PR5_6">Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR5_7" data-id="PR5_7">Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR5_8" data-id="PR5_8">Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR5_9" data-id="PR5_9">Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR5_10" data-id="PR5_10">Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR5_11" data-id="PR5_11">And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR5_12" data-id="PR5_12">And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR5_13" data-id="PR5_13">And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR5_14" data-id="PR5_14">I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR5_15" data-id="PR5_15">Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR5_16" data-id="PR5_16">Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR5_17" data-id="PR5_17">Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR5_18" data-id="PR5_18">Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR5_19" data-id="PR5_19">Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR5_20" data-id="PR5_20">And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR5_21" data-id="PR5_21">For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR5_22" data-id="PR5_22">His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR5_23" data-id="PR5_23">He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</span>
