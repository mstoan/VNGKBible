<div class="c">5</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_1" data-id="SS5_1">I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_2" data-id="SS5_2">I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_3" data-id="SS5_3">I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_4" data-id="SS5_4">My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_5" data-id="SS5_5">I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_6" data-id="SS5_6">I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_7" data-id="SS5_7">The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_8" data-id="SS5_8">I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_9" data-id="SS5_9">What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_10" data-id="SS5_10">My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_11" data-id="SS5_11">His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a raven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_12" data-id="SS5_12">His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_13" data-id="SS5_13">His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_14" data-id="SS5_14">His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_15" data-id="SS5_15">His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_16" data-id="SS5_16">His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.</span>
