<div class="c">8</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_1" data-id="HB8_1">Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_2" data-id="HB8_2">A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_3" data-id="HB8_3">For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_4" data-id="HB8_4">For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_5" data-id="HB8_5">Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_6" data-id="HB8_6">But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_7" data-id="HB8_7">For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_8" data-id="HB8_8">For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_9" data-id="HB8_9">Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_10" data-id="HB8_10">For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_11" data-id="HB8_11">And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_12" data-id="HB8_12">For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_13" data-id="HB8_13">In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.</span>
