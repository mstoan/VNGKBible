<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB16_2" data-id="JB16_2">I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB16_3" data-id="JB16_3">Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB16_4" data-id="JB16_4">I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB16_5" data-id="JB16_5">But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB16_6" data-id="JB16_6">Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB16_7" data-id="JB16_7">But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB16_8" data-id="JB16_8">And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB16_9" data-id="JB16_9">He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB16_10" data-id="JB16_10">They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB16_11" data-id="JB16_11">God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB16_12" data-id="JB16_12">I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB16_13" data-id="JB16_13">His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB16_14" data-id="JB16_14">He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB16_15" data-id="JB16_15">I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB16_16" data-id="JB16_16">My face is foul with weeping, and my eyelids is the shadow of death;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB16_17" data-id="JB16_17">Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB16_18" data-id="JB16_18">O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB16_19" data-id="JB16_19">Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB16_20" data-id="JB16_20">My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB16_21" data-id="JB16_21">O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB16_22" data-id="JB16_22">When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.</span>
