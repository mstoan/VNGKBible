<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_5" data-id="TT1_5">For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_7" data-id="TT1_7">For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;</span>
