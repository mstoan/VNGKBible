<div class="c">6</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS6_1" data-id="IS6_1">In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS6_2" data-id="IS6_2">Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS6_3" data-id="IS6_3">And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS6_4" data-id="IS6_4">And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS6_5" data-id="IS6_5">Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS6_6" data-id="IS6_6">Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS6_7" data-id="IS6_7">And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS6_8" data-id="IS6_8">Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS6_9" data-id="IS6_9">And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS6_10" data-id="IS6_10">Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS6_11" data-id="IS6_11">Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS6_12" data-id="IS6_12">And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS6_13" data-id="IS6_13">But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.</span>
