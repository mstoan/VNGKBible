<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_2" data-id="AM9_2">Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_3" data-id="AM9_3">And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_4" data-id="AM9_4">And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_5" data-id="AM9_5">And the Lord GOD of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_6" data-id="AM9_6">It is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_7" data-id="AM9_7">Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_8" data-id="AM9_8">Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_9" data-id="AM9_9">For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_10" data-id="AM9_10">All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_11" data-id="AM9_11">In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old:</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_12" data-id="AM9_12">That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which are called by my name, saith the LORD that doeth this.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_13" data-id="AM9_13">Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_14" data-id="AM9_14">And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_15" data-id="AM9_15">And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the LORD thy God.</span>
