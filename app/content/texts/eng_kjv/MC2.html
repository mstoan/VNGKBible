<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_2" data-id="MC2_2">And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_3" data-id="MC2_3">Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_4" data-id="MC2_4">In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_5" data-id="MC2_5">Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_6" data-id="MC2_6">Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_7" data-id="MC2_7">O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_8" data-id="MC2_8">Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_9" data-id="MC2_9">The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_10" data-id="MC2_10">Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_11" data-id="MC2_11">If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_12" data-id="MC2_12">I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_13" data-id="MC2_13">The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.</span>
