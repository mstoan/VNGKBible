<div class="c">3</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_1" data-id="E23_1">In the thirtieth year after the ruin of the city I was in Babylon, and lay troubled upon my bed, and my thoughts came up over my heart:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_2" data-id="E23_2">For I saw the desolation of Sion, and the wealth of them that dwelt at Babylon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_3" data-id="E23_3">And my spirit was sore moved, so that I began to speak words full of fear to the most High, and said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_4" data-id="E23_4">O Lord, who bearest rule, thou spakest at the beginning, when thou didst plant the earth, and that thyself alone, and commandedst the people,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_5" data-id="E23_5">And gavest a body unto Adam without soul, which was the workmanship of thine hands, and didst breathe into him the breath of life, and he was made living before thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_6" data-id="E23_6">And thou leadest him into paradise, which thy right hand had planted, before ever the earth came forward.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_7" data-id="E23_7">And unto him thou gavest commandment to love thy way: which he transgressed, and immediately thou appointedst death in him and in his generations, of whom came nations, tribes, people, and kindreds, out of number.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_8" data-id="E23_8">And every people walked after their own will, and did wonderful things before thee, and despised thy commandments.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_9" data-id="E23_9">And again in process of time thou broughtest the flood upon those that dwelt in the world, and destroyedst them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_10" data-id="E23_10">And it came to pass in every of them, that as death was to Adam, so was the flood to these.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_11" data-id="E23_11">Nevertheless one of them thou leftest, namely, Noah with his household, of whom came all righteous men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_12" data-id="E23_12">And it happened, that when they that dwelt upon the earth began to multiply, and had gotten them many children, and were a great people, they began again to be more ungodly than the first.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_13" data-id="E23_13">Now when they lived so wickedly before thee, thou didst choose thee a man from among them, whose name was Abraham.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_14" data-id="E23_14">Him thou lovedst, and unto him only thou shewedst thy will:</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_15" data-id="E23_15">And madest an everlasting covenant with him, promising him that thou wouldest never forsake his seed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_16" data-id="E23_16">And unto him thou gavest Isaac, and unto Isaac also thou gavest Jacob and Esau. As for Jacob, thou didst choose him to thee, and put by Esau: and so Jacob became a great multitude.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_17" data-id="E23_17">And it came to pass, that when thou leadest his seed out of Egypt, thou broughtest them up to the mount Sinai.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_18" data-id="E23_18">And bowing the heavens, thou didst set fast the earth, movedst the whole world, and madest the depths to tremble, and troubledst the men of that age.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_19" data-id="E23_19">And thy glory went through four gates, of fire, and of earthquake, and of wind, and of cold; that thou mightest give the law unto the seed of Jacob, and diligence unto the generation of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_20" data-id="E23_20">And yet tookest thou not away from them a wicked heart, that thy law might bring forth fruit in them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_21" data-id="E23_21">For the first Adam bearing a wicked heart transgressed, and was overcome; and so be all they that are born of him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_22" data-id="E23_22">Thus infirmity was made permanent; and the law (also) in the heart of the people with the malignity of the root; so that the good departed away, and the evil abode still.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_23" data-id="E23_23">So the times passed away, and the years were brought to an end: then didst thou raise thee up a servant, called David:</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_24" data-id="E23_24">Whom thou commandedst to build a city unto thy name, and to offer incense and oblations unto thee therein.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_25" data-id="E23_25">When this was done many years, then they that inhabited the city forsook thee,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_26" data-id="E23_26">And in all things did even as Adam and all his generations had done: for they also had a wicked heart:</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_27" data-id="E23_27">And so thou gavest thy city over into the hands of thine enemies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_28" data-id="E23_28">Are their deeds then any better that inhabit Babylon, that they should therefore have the dominion over Sion?</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_29" data-id="E23_29">For when I came thither, and had seen impieties without number, then my soul saw many evildoers in this thirtieth year, so that my heart failed me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_30" data-id="E23_30">For I have seen how thou sufferest them sinning, and hast spared wicked doers: and hast destroyed thy people, and hast preserved thine enemies, and hast not signified it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_31" data-id="E23_31">I do not remember how this way may be left: Are they then of Babylon better than they of Sion?</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_32" data-id="E23_32">Or is there any other people that knoweth thee beside Israel? or what generation hath so believed thy covenants as Jacob?</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_33" data-id="E23_33">And yet their reward appeareth not, and their labour hath no fruit: for I have gone here and there through the heathen, and I see that they flow in wealth, and think not upon thy commandments.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_34" data-id="E23_34">Weigh thou therefore our wickedness now in the balance, and their's also that dwell the world; and so shall thy name no where be found but in Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_35" data-id="E23_35">Or when was it that they which dwell upon the earth have not sinned in thy sight? or what people have so kept thy commandments?</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v E23_36" data-id="E23_36">Thou shalt find that Israel by name hath kept thy precepts; but not the heathen.</span>
