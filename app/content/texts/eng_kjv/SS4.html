<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_2" data-id="SS4_2">Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_3" data-id="SS4_3">Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_4" data-id="SS4_4">Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_5" data-id="SS4_5">Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_6" data-id="SS4_6">Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_7" data-id="SS4_7">Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_8" data-id="SS4_8">Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_9" data-id="SS4_9">Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_10" data-id="SS4_10">How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_11" data-id="SS4_11">Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_12" data-id="SS4_12">A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_13" data-id="SS4_13">Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_14" data-id="SS4_14">Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_15" data-id="SS4_15">A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_16" data-id="SS4_16">Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.</span>
