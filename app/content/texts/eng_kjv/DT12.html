<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT12_2" data-id="DT12_2">Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT12_3" data-id="DT12_3">And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT12_4" data-id="DT12_4">Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT12_5" data-id="DT12_5">But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT12_6" data-id="DT12_6">And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT12_7" data-id="DT12_7">And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT12_8" data-id="DT12_8">Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT12_9" data-id="DT12_9">For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God giveth you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT12_10" data-id="DT12_10">But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety;</span>

<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT12_19" data-id="DT12_19">Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT12_20" data-id="DT12_20">When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT12_21" data-id="DT12_21">If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT12_22" data-id="DT12_22">Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT12_23" data-id="DT12_23">Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT12_24" data-id="DT12_24">Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT12_25" data-id="DT12_25">Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT12_26" data-id="DT12_26">Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose:</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT12_27" data-id="DT12_27">And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT12_28" data-id="DT12_28">Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT12_29" data-id="DT12_29">When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their land;</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT12_30" data-id="DT12_30">Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT12_31" data-id="DT12_31">Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT12_32" data-id="DT12_32">What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.</span>
