<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR23_2" data-id="SR23_2">Who will set scourges over my thoughts, and the discipline of wisdom over mine heart? that they spare me not for mine ignorances, and it pass not by my sins:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR23_3" data-id="SR23_3">Lest mine ignorances increase, and my sins abound to my destruction, and I fall before mine adversaries, and mine enemy rejoice over me, whose hope is far from thy mercy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR23_4" data-id="SR23_4">O Lord, Father and God of my life, give me not a proud look, but turn away from thy servants always a haughty mind.</span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR23_8" data-id="SR23_8">The sinner shall be left in his foolishness: both the evil speaker and the proud shall fall thereby.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR23_9" data-id="SR23_9">Accustom not thy mouth to swearing; neither use thyself to the naming of the Holy One.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR23_10" data-id="SR23_10">For as a servant that is continually beaten shall not be without a blue mark: so he that sweareth and nameth God continually shall not be faultless.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR23_11" data-id="SR23_11">A man that useth much swearing shall be filled with iniquity, and the plague shall never depart from his house: if he shall offend, his sin shall be upon him: and if he acknowledge not his sin, he maketh a double offence: and if he swear in vain, he shall not be innocent, but his house shall be full of calamities.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR23_12" data-id="SR23_12">There is a word that is clothed about with death: God grant that it be not found in the heritage of Jacob; for all such things shall be far from the godly, and they shall not wallow in their sins.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR23_16" data-id="SR23_16">Two sorts of men multiply sin, and the third will bring wrath: a hot mind is as a burning fire, it will never be quenched till it be consumed: a fornicator in the body of his flesh will never cease till he hath kindled a fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR23_17" data-id="SR23_17">All bread is sweet to a whoremonger, he will not leave off till he die.</span>

<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR23_23" data-id="SR23_23">For first, she hath disobeyed the law of the most High; and secondly, she hath trespassed against her own husband; and thirdly, she hath played the whore in adultery, and brought children by another man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR23_24" data-id="SR23_24">She shall be brought out into the congregation, and inquisition shall be made of her children.</span>
