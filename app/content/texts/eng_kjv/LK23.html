<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_2" data-id="LK23_2">And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_3" data-id="LK23_3">And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_4" data-id="LK23_4">Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_5" data-id="LK23_5">And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_6" data-id="LK23_6">When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_7" data-id="LK23_7">And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_8" data-id="LK23_8">And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_9" data-id="LK23_9">Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_10" data-id="LK23_10">And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_11" data-id="LK23_11">And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_12" data-id="LK23_12">And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_13" data-id="LK23_13">And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_14" data-id="LK23_14">Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_15" data-id="LK23_15">No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_16" data-id="LK23_16">I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_17" data-id="LK23_17">(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_18" data-id="LK23_18">And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_19" data-id="LK23_19">(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_20" data-id="LK23_20">Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_21" data-id="LK23_21">But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_22" data-id="LK23_22">And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_23" data-id="LK23_23">And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_24" data-id="LK23_24">And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_25" data-id="LK23_25">And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_26" data-id="LK23_26">And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_27" data-id="LK23_27">And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_28" data-id="LK23_28">But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_29" data-id="LK23_29">For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_30" data-id="LK23_30">Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_31" data-id="LK23_31">For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_32" data-id="LK23_32">And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_33" data-id="LK23_33">And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_34" data-id="LK23_34">Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_35" data-id="LK23_35">And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_36" data-id="LK23_36">And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_37" data-id="LK23_37">And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_38" data-id="LK23_38">And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_39" data-id="LK23_39">And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_40" data-id="LK23_40">But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_41" data-id="LK23_41">And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_42" data-id="LK23_42">And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_43" data-id="LK23_43">And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_44" data-id="LK23_44">And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_45" data-id="LK23_45">And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_46" data-id="LK23_46">And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_47" data-id="LK23_47">Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_48" data-id="LK23_48">And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_49" data-id="LK23_49">And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_50" data-id="LK23_50">And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counseller; and he was a good man, and a just:</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_51" data-id="LK23_51">(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_52" data-id="LK23_52">This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_53" data-id="LK23_53">And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</span>
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_54" data-id="LK23_54">And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</span>
<span class="v-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_55" data-id="LK23_55">And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</span>
<span class="v-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_56" data-id="LK23_56">And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.</span>
