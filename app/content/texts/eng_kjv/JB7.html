<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB7_2" data-id="JB7_2">As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB7_3" data-id="JB7_3">So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB7_4" data-id="JB7_4">When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB7_5" data-id="JB7_5">My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB7_6" data-id="JB7_6">My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB7_7" data-id="JB7_7">O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB7_8" data-id="JB7_8">The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB7_9" data-id="JB7_9">As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB7_10" data-id="JB7_10">He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB7_11" data-id="JB7_11">Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB7_12" data-id="JB7_12">Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB7_13" data-id="JB7_13">When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB7_14" data-id="JB7_14">Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB7_15" data-id="JB7_15">So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB7_16" data-id="JB7_16">I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB7_17" data-id="JB7_17">What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB7_18" data-id="JB7_18">And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB7_19" data-id="JB7_19">How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB7_20" data-id="JB7_20">I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB7_21" data-id="JB7_21">And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.</span>
