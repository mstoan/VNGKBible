<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_3" data-id="H15_3">For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_4" data-id="H15_4">But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.</span>
