<div class="c">64</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS64_1" data-id="IS64_1">Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS64_2" data-id="IS64_2">As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence!</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS64_3" data-id="IS64_3">When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS64_4" data-id="IS64_4">For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS64_5" data-id="IS64_5">Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS64_6" data-id="IS64_6">But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS64_7" data-id="IS64_7">And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS64_8" data-id="IS64_8">But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS64_9" data-id="IS64_9">Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS64_10" data-id="IS64_10">Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS64_11" data-id="IS64_11">Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS64_12" data-id="IS64_12">Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O LORD? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?</span>
