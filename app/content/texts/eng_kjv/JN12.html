<div class="c">12</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_1" data-id="JN12_1">Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_2" data-id="JN12_2">There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_3" data-id="JN12_3">Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_4" data-id="JN12_4">Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_5" data-id="JN12_5">Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_6" data-id="JN12_6">This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_7" data-id="JN12_7">Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_8" data-id="JN12_8">For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_9" data-id="JN12_9">Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_10" data-id="JN12_10">But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_11" data-id="JN12_11">Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_12" data-id="JN12_12">On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_13" data-id="JN12_13">Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_14" data-id="JN12_14">And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_15" data-id="JN12_15">Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_16" data-id="JN12_16">These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_17" data-id="JN12_17">The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_18" data-id="JN12_18">For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_19" data-id="JN12_19">The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_20" data-id="JN12_20">And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_21" data-id="JN12_21">The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_22" data-id="JN12_22">Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_23" data-id="JN12_23">And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_24" data-id="JN12_24">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_25" data-id="JN12_25">He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_26" data-id="JN12_26">If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_27" data-id="JN12_27">Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_28" data-id="JN12_28">Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_29" data-id="JN12_29">The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_30" data-id="JN12_30">Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_31" data-id="JN12_31">Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_32" data-id="JN12_32">And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_33" data-id="JN12_33">This he said, signifying what death he should die.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_34" data-id="JN12_34">The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_35" data-id="JN12_35">Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_36" data-id="JN12_36">While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_37" data-id="JN12_37">But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_38" data-id="JN12_38">That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_39" data-id="JN12_39">Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_40" data-id="JN12_40">He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_41" data-id="JN12_41">These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_42" data-id="JN12_42">Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_43" data-id="JN12_43">For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_44" data-id="JN12_44">Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_45" data-id="JN12_45">And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_46" data-id="JN12_46">I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_47" data-id="JN12_47">And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_48" data-id="JN12_48">He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_49" data-id="JN12_49">For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_50" data-id="JN12_50">And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.</span>
