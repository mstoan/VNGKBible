<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_2" data-id="ZP3_2">She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_3" data-id="ZP3_3">Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_4" data-id="ZP3_4">Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_5" data-id="ZP3_5">The just LORD is in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_6" data-id="ZP3_6">I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_7" data-id="ZP3_7">I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, and corrupted all their doings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_8" data-id="ZP3_8">Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_9" data-id="ZP3_9">For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_10" data-id="ZP3_10">From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_11" data-id="ZP3_11">In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_12" data-id="ZP3_12">I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_13" data-id="ZP3_13">The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_14" data-id="ZP3_14">Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_15" data-id="ZP3_15">The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_16" data-id="ZP3_16">In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_17" data-id="ZP3_17">The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_18" data-id="ZP3_18">I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly, who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_19" data-id="ZP3_19">Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_20" data-id="ZP3_20">At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD.</span>
