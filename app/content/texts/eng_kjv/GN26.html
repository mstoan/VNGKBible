<div class="c">26</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_1" data-id="GN26_1">And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_2" data-id="GN26_2">And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_3" data-id="GN26_3">Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_4" data-id="GN26_4">And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_5" data-id="GN26_5">Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_6" data-id="GN26_6">And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_7" data-id="GN26_7">And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_8" data-id="GN26_8">And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_9" data-id="GN26_9">And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_10" data-id="GN26_10">And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_11" data-id="GN26_11">And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_12" data-id="GN26_12">Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_13" data-id="GN26_13">And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_14" data-id="GN26_14">For he had possession of flocks, and possessions of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_15" data-id="GN26_15">For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_16" data-id="GN26_16">And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_17" data-id="GN26_17">And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_18" data-id="GN26_18">And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_19" data-id="GN26_19">And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_20" data-id="GN26_20">And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_21" data-id="GN26_21">And they digged another well, and strove for that also:and he called the name of it Sitnah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_22" data-id="GN26_22">And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_23" data-id="GN26_23">And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_24" data-id="GN26_24">And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_25" data-id="GN26_25">And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_26" data-id="GN26_26">Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_27" data-id="GN26_27">And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_28" data-id="GN26_28">And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_29" data-id="GN26_29">That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_30" data-id="GN26_30">And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_31" data-id="GN26_31">And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_32" data-id="GN26_32">And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_33" data-id="GN26_33">And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_34" data-id="GN26_34">And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN26_35" data-id="GN26_35">Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.</span>
