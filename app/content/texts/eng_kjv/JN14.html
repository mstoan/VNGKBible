<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_2" data-id="JN14_2">In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_3" data-id="JN14_3">And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_4" data-id="JN14_4">And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_5" data-id="JN14_5">Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_6" data-id="JN14_6">Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_7" data-id="JN14_7">If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_8" data-id="JN14_8">Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_9" data-id="JN14_9">Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_10" data-id="JN14_10">Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_11" data-id="JN14_11">Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_12" data-id="JN14_12">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_16" data-id="JN14_16">And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_17" data-id="JN14_17">Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_18" data-id="JN14_18">I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.</span>

<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_21" data-id="JN14_21">He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_22" data-id="JN14_22">Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_23" data-id="JN14_23">Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_24" data-id="JN14_24">He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_25" data-id="JN14_25">These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_26" data-id="JN14_26">But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_27" data-id="JN14_27">Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_28" data-id="JN14_28">Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_29" data-id="JN14_29">And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_30" data-id="JN14_30">Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN14_31" data-id="JN14_31">But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.</span>
