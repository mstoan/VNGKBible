<div class="c">3</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_1" data-id="JM3_1">My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_2" data-id="JM3_2">For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_3" data-id="JM3_3">Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_4" data-id="JM3_4">Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_5" data-id="JM3_5">Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_6" data-id="JM3_6">And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_7" data-id="JM3_7">For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_8" data-id="JM3_8">But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_9" data-id="JM3_9">Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_10" data-id="JM3_10">Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_11" data-id="JM3_11">Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_12" data-id="JM3_12">Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_13" data-id="JM3_13">Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_14" data-id="JM3_14">But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_15" data-id="JM3_15">This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_16" data-id="JM3_16">For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_17" data-id="JM3_17">But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_18" data-id="JM3_18">And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.</span>
