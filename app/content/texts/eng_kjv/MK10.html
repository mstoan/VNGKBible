<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK10_33" data-id="MK10_33">Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK10_34" data-id="MK10_34">And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.</span>

<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK10_37" data-id="MK10_37">They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK10_38" data-id="MK10_38">But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK10_39" data-id="MK10_39">And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK10_40" data-id="MK10_40">But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK10_41" data-id="MK10_41">And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK10_42" data-id="MK10_42">But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK10_43" data-id="MK10_43">But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK10_44" data-id="MK10_44">And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK10_45" data-id="MK10_45">For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK10_46" data-id="MK10_46">And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK10_47" data-id="MK10_47">And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK10_48" data-id="MK10_48">And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK10_49" data-id="MK10_49">And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK10_50" data-id="MK10_50">And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK10_51" data-id="MK10_51">And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK10_52" data-id="MK10_52">And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.</span>
