<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_2" data-id="LM3_2">He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_3" data-id="LM3_3">Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me all the day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_4" data-id="LM3_4">My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_5" data-id="LM3_5">He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_6" data-id="LM3_6">He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_7" data-id="LM3_7">He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_8" data-id="LM3_8">Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_9" data-id="LM3_9">He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_10" data-id="LM3_10">He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_11" data-id="LM3_11">He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_12" data-id="LM3_12">He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_13" data-id="LM3_13">He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_14" data-id="LM3_14">I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.</span>

<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_28" data-id="LM3_28">He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_29" data-id="LM3_29">He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_30" data-id="LM3_30">He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_31" data-id="LM3_31">For the Lord will not cast off for ever:</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_32" data-id="LM3_32">But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_33" data-id="LM3_33">For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.</span>

<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_35" data-id="LM3_35">To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_36" data-id="LM3_36">To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.</span>

<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_39" data-id="LM3_39">Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_40" data-id="LM3_40">Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_41" data-id="LM3_41">Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_42" data-id="LM3_42">We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_43" data-id="LM3_43">Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_44" data-id="LM3_44">Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_45" data-id="LM3_45">Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.</span>

<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_52" data-id="LM3_52">Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.</span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_53" data-id="LM3_53">They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_54" data-id="LM3_54">Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.</span>
<span class="v-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_55" data-id="LM3_55">I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_56" data-id="LM3_56">Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.</span>
<span class="v-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_57" data-id="LM3_57">Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM3_58" data-id="LM3_58">O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.</span>
