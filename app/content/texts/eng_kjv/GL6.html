<div class="c">6</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_1" data-id="GL6_1">Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_2" data-id="GL6_2">Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_3" data-id="GL6_3">For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_4" data-id="GL6_4">But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_5" data-id="GL6_5">For every man shall bear his own burden.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_6" data-id="GL6_6">Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_7" data-id="GL6_7">Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_8" data-id="GL6_8">For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_9" data-id="GL6_9">And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_10" data-id="GL6_10">As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_11" data-id="GL6_11">Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_12" data-id="GL6_12">As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_13" data-id="GL6_13">For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_14" data-id="GL6_14">But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_15" data-id="GL6_15">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_16" data-id="GL6_16">And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_17" data-id="GL6_17">From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_18" data-id="GL6_18">Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</span>
