<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS44_2" data-id="PS44_2">How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS44_3" data-id="PS44_3">For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS44_4" data-id="PS44_4">Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS44_5" data-id="PS44_5">Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS44_6" data-id="PS44_6">For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS44_7" data-id="PS44_7">But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS44_8" data-id="PS44_8">In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS44_9" data-id="PS44_9">But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS44_10" data-id="PS44_10">Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS44_11" data-id="PS44_11">Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS44_12" data-id="PS44_12">Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth by their price.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS44_13" data-id="PS44_13">Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS44_14" data-id="PS44_14">Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS44_15" data-id="PS44_15">My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS44_16" data-id="PS44_16">For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS44_17" data-id="PS44_17">All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS44_18" data-id="PS44_18">Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS44_19" data-id="PS44_19">Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS44_20" data-id="PS44_20">If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;</span>

<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS44_23" data-id="PS44_23">Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS44_24" data-id="PS44_24">Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS44_25" data-id="PS44_25">For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS44_26" data-id="PS44_26">Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.</span>
