<div class="c">4</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_1" data-id="MK4_1">And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_2" data-id="MK4_2">And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_3" data-id="MK4_3">Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_4" data-id="MK4_4">And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_5" data-id="MK4_5">And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_6" data-id="MK4_6">But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_7" data-id="MK4_7">And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_8" data-id="MK4_8">And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_9" data-id="MK4_9">And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_10" data-id="MK4_10">And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_11" data-id="MK4_11">And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_12" data-id="MK4_12">That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_13" data-id="MK4_13">And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_14" data-id="MK4_14">The sower soweth the word.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_15" data-id="MK4_15">And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_16" data-id="MK4_16">And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_17" data-id="MK4_17">And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_18" data-id="MK4_18">And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_19" data-id="MK4_19">And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_20" data-id="MK4_20">And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_21" data-id="MK4_21">And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_22" data-id="MK4_22">For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_23" data-id="MK4_23">If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_24" data-id="MK4_24">And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_25" data-id="MK4_25">For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_26" data-id="MK4_26">And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_27" data-id="MK4_27">And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_28" data-id="MK4_28">For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_29" data-id="MK4_29">But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_30" data-id="MK4_30">And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_31" data-id="MK4_31">It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_32" data-id="MK4_32">But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_33" data-id="MK4_33">And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_34" data-id="MK4_34">But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_35" data-id="MK4_35">And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_36" data-id="MK4_36">And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_37" data-id="MK4_37">And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_38" data-id="MK4_38">And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_39" data-id="MK4_39">And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_40" data-id="MK4_40">And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_41" data-id="MK4_41">And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</span>
