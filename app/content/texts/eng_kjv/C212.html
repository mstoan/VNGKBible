<div class="c">12</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_1" data-id="C212_1">It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_2" data-id="C212_2">I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_3" data-id="C212_3">And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_4" data-id="C212_4">How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_5" data-id="C212_5">Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_6" data-id="C212_6">For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_7" data-id="C212_7">And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_8" data-id="C212_8">For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_9" data-id="C212_9">And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_10" data-id="C212_10">Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_11" data-id="C212_11">I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_12" data-id="C212_12">Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_13" data-id="C212_13">For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_14" data-id="C212_14">Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_15" data-id="C212_15">And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_16" data-id="C212_16">But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_17" data-id="C212_17">Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_18" data-id="C212_18">I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_19" data-id="C212_19">Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_20" data-id="C212_20">For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_21" data-id="C212_21">And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.</span>
