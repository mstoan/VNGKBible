<div class="c">6</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS6_1" data-id="WS6_1">Hear therefore, O ye kings, and understand; learn, ye that be judges of the ends of the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS6_2" data-id="WS6_2">Give ear, ye that rule the people, and glory in the multitude of nations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS6_3" data-id="WS6_3">For power is given you of the Lord, and sovereignty from the Highest, who shall try your works, and search out your counsels.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS6_4" data-id="WS6_4">Because, being ministers of his kingdom, ye have not judged aright, nor kept the law, nor walked after the counsel of God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS6_5" data-id="WS6_5">Horribly and speedily shall he come upon you: for a sharp judgment shall be to them that be in high places.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS6_6" data-id="WS6_6">For mercy will soon pardon the meanest: but mighty men shall be mightily tormented.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS6_7" data-id="WS6_7">For he which is Lord over all shall fear no man's person, neither shall he stand in awe of any man's greatness: for he hath made the small and great, and careth for all alike.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS6_8" data-id="WS6_8">But a sore trial shall come upon the mighty.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS6_9" data-id="WS6_9">Unto you therefore, O kings, do I speak, that ye may learn wisdom, and not fall away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS6_10" data-id="WS6_10">For they that keep holiness holily shall be judged holy: and they that have learned such things shall find what to answer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS6_11" data-id="WS6_11">Wherefore set your affection upon my words; desire them, and ye shall be instructed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS6_12" data-id="WS6_12">Wisdom is glorious, and never fadeth away: yea, she is easily seen of them that love her, and found of such as seek her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS6_13" data-id="WS6_13">She preventeth them that desire her, in making herself first known unto them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS6_14" data-id="WS6_14">Whoso seeketh her early shall have no great travail: for he shall find her sitting at his doors.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS6_15" data-id="WS6_15">To think therefore upon her is perfection of wisdom: and whoso watcheth for her shall quickly be without care.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS6_16" data-id="WS6_16">For she goeth about seeking such as are worthy of her, sheweth herself favourably unto them in the ways, and meeteth them in every thought.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS6_17" data-id="WS6_17">For the very true beginning of her is the desire of discipline; and the care of discipline is love;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS6_18" data-id="WS6_18">And love is the keeping of her laws; and the giving heed unto her laws is the assurance of incorruption;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS6_19" data-id="WS6_19">And incorruption maketh us near unto God:</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS6_20" data-id="WS6_20">Therefore the desire of wisdom bringeth to a kingdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS6_21" data-id="WS6_21">If your delight be then in thrones and sceptres, O ye kings of the people, honour wisdom, that ye may reign for evermore.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS6_22" data-id="WS6_22">As for wisdom, what she is, and how she came up, I will tell you, and will not hide mysteries from you: but will seek her out from the beginning of her nativity, and bring the knowledge of her into light, and will not pass over the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS6_23" data-id="WS6_23">Neither will I go with consuming envy; for such a man shall have no fellowship with wisdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS6_24" data-id="WS6_24">But the multitude of the wise is the welfare of the world: and a wise king is the upholding of the people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS6_25" data-id="WS6_25">Receive therefore instruction through my words, and it shall do you good.</span>
