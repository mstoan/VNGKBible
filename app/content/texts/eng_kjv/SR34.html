<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_2" data-id="SR34_2">Whoso regardeth dreams is like him that catcheth at a shadow, and followeth after the wind.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_3" data-id="SR34_3">The vision of dreams is the resemblance of one thing to another, even as the likeness of a face to a face.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_4" data-id="SR34_4">Of an unclean thing what can be cleansed? and from that thing which is false what truth can come?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_5" data-id="SR34_5">Divinations, and soothsayings, and dreams, are vain: and the heart fancieth, as a woman's heart in travail.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_6" data-id="SR34_6">If they be not sent from the most High in thy visitation, set not thy heart upon them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_7" data-id="SR34_7">For dreams have deceived many, and they have failed that put their trust in them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_8" data-id="SR34_8">The law shall be found perfect without lies: and wisdom is perfection to a faithful mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_9" data-id="SR34_9">A man that hath travelled knoweth many things; and he that hath much experience will declare wisdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_10" data-id="SR34_10">He that hath no experience knoweth little: but he that hath travelled is full of prudence.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_11" data-id="SR34_11">He that hath no experience knoweth little: but he that hath travelled is full of prudence.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_12" data-id="SR34_12">When I travelled, I saw many things; and I understand more than I can express.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_13" data-id="SR34_13">I was ofttimes in danger of death: yet I was delivered because of these things.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_16" data-id="SR34_16">Whoso feareth the Lord shall not fear nor be afraid; for he is his hope.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_17" data-id="SR34_17">Blessed is the soul of him that feareth the Lord: to whom doth he look? and who is his strength?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_18" data-id="SR34_18">Blessed is the soul of him that feareth the Lord: to whom doth he look? and who is his strength?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_19" data-id="SR34_19">For the eyes of the Lord are upon them that love him, he is their mighty protection and strong stay, a defence from heat, and a cover from the sun at noon, a preservation from stumbling, and an help from falling.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_20" data-id="SR34_20">He raiseth up the soul, and lighteneth the eyes: he giveth health, life, and blessing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_21" data-id="SR34_21">He that sacrificeth of a thing wrongfully gotten, his offering is ridiculous; and the gifts of unjust men are not accepted.</span>

<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_23" data-id="SR34_23">The most High is not pleased with the offerings of the wicked; neither is he pacified for sin by the multitude of sacrifices.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_24" data-id="SR34_24">Whoso bringeth an offering of the goods of the poor doeth as one that killeth the son before his father's eyes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_25" data-id="SR34_25">The bread of the needy is their life: he that defraudeth him thereof is a man of blood.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_26" data-id="SR34_26">He that taketh away his neighbour's living slayeth him; and he that defraudeth the labourer of his hire is a bloodshedder.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_27" data-id="SR34_27">He that taketh away his neighbour's living slayeth him; and he that defraudeth the labourer of his hire is a bloodshedder.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_28" data-id="SR34_28">When one buildeth, and another pulleth down, what profit have they then but labour?</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_29" data-id="SR34_29">When one prayeth, and another curseth, whose voice will the Lord hear?</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_30" data-id="SR34_30">He that washeth himself after the touching of a dead body, if he touch it again, what availeth his washing?</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR34_31" data-id="SR34_31">So is it with a man that fasteth for his sins, and goeth again, and doeth the same: who will hear his prayer? or what doth his humbling profit him?</span>
