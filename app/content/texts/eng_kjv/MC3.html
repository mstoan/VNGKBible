<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC3_2" data-id="MC3_2">Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC3_3" data-id="MC3_3">Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC3_4" data-id="MC3_4">Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC3_5" data-id="MC3_5">Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC3_6" data-id="MC3_6">Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC3_7" data-id="MC3_7">Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC3_8" data-id="MC3_8">But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC3_9" data-id="MC3_9">Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC3_10" data-id="MC3_10">They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC3_11" data-id="MC3_11">The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD among us? none evil can come upon us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC3_12" data-id="MC3_12">Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.</span>
