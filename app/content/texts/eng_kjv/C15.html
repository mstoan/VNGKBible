<div class="c">5</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_1" data-id="C15_1">It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_2" data-id="C15_2">And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_3" data-id="C15_3">For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_4" data-id="C15_4">In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_5" data-id="C15_5">To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_6" data-id="C15_6">Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_7" data-id="C15_7">Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_8" data-id="C15_8">Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_9" data-id="C15_9">I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_10" data-id="C15_10">Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_11" data-id="C15_11">But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_12" data-id="C15_12">For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_13" data-id="C15_13">But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.</span>
