<div class="c">14</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_1" data-id="WS14_1">Again, one preparing himself to sail, and about to pass through the raging waves, calleth upon a piece of wood more rotten than the vessel that carrieth him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_2" data-id="WS14_2">For verily desire of gain devised that, and the workman built it by his skill.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_3" data-id="WS14_3">But thy providence, O Father, governeth it: for thou hast made a way in the sea, and a safe path in the waves;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_4" data-id="WS14_4">Shewing that thou canst save from all danger: yea, though a man went to sea without art.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_5" data-id="WS14_5">Nevertheless thou wouldest not that the works of thy wisdom should be idle, and therefore do men commit their lives to a small piece of wood, and passing the rough sea in a weak vessel are saved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_6" data-id="WS14_6">For in the old time also, when the proud giants perished, the hope of the world governed by thy hand escaped in a weak vessel, and left to all ages a seed of generation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_7" data-id="WS14_7">For blessed is the wood whereby righteousness cometh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_8" data-id="WS14_8">But that which is made with hands is cursed, as well it, as he that made it: he, because he made it; and it, because, being corruptible, it was called god.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_9" data-id="WS14_9">For the ungodly and his ungodliness are both alike hateful unto God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_10" data-id="WS14_10">For that which is made shall be punished together with him that made it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_11" data-id="WS14_11">Therefore even upon the idols of the Gentiles shall there be a visitation: because in the creature of God they are become an abomination, and stumblingblocks to the souls of men, and a snare to the feet of the unwise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_12" data-id="WS14_12">For the devising of idols was the beginning of spiritual fornication, and the invention of them the corruption of life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_13" data-id="WS14_13">For neither were they from the beginning, neither shall they be for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_14" data-id="WS14_14">For by the vain glory of men they entered into the world, and therefore shall they come shortly to an end.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_15" data-id="WS14_15">For a father afflicted with untimely mourning, when he hath made an image of his child soon taken away, now honoured him as a god, which was then a dead man, and delivered to those that were under him ceremonies and sacrifices.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_16" data-id="WS14_16">Thus in process of time an ungodly custom grown strong was kept as a law, and graven images were worshipped by the commandments of kings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_17" data-id="WS14_17">Whom men could not honour in presence, because they dwelt far off, they took the counterfeit of his visage from far, and made an express image of a king whom they honoured, to the end that by this their forwardness they might flatter him that was absent, as if he were present.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_18" data-id="WS14_18">Also the singular diligence of the artificer did help to set forward the ignorant to more superstition.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_19" data-id="WS14_19">For he, peradventure willing to please one in authority, forced all his skill to make the resemblance of the best fashion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_20" data-id="WS14_20">And so the multitude, allured by the grace of the work, took him now for a god, which a little before was but honoured.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_21" data-id="WS14_21">And this was an occasion to deceive the world: for men, serving either calamity or tyranny, did ascribe unto stones and stocks the incommunicable name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_22" data-id="WS14_22">Moreover this was not enough for them, that they erred in the knowledge of God; but whereas they lived in the great war of ignorance, those so great plagues called they peace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_23" data-id="WS14_23">For whilst they slew their children in sacrifices, or used secret ceremonies, or made revellings of strange rites;</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_24" data-id="WS14_24">They kept neither lives nor marriages any longer undefiled: but either one slew another traiterously, or grieved him by adultery.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_25" data-id="WS14_25">So that there reigned in all men without exception blood, manslaughter, theft, and dissimulation, corruption, unfaithfulness, tumults, perjury,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_26" data-id="WS14_26">Disquieting of good men, forgetfulness of good turns, defiling of souls, changing of kind, disorder in marriages, adultery, and shameless uncleanness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_27" data-id="WS14_27">For the worshipping of idols not to be named is the beginning, the cause, and the end, of all evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_28" data-id="WS14_28">For either they are mad when they be merry, or prophesy lies, or live unjustly, or else lightly forswear themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_29" data-id="WS14_29">For insomuch as their trust is in idols, which have no life; though they swear falsely, yet they look not to be hurt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_30" data-id="WS14_30">Howbeit for both causes shall they be justly punished: both because they thought not well of God, giving heed unto idols, and also unjustly swore in deceit, despising holiness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS14_31" data-id="WS14_31">For it is not the power of them by whom they swear: but it is the just vengeance of sinners, that punisheth always the offence of the ungodly.</span>
