<div class="c">12</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_1" data-id="C112_1">Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_2" data-id="C112_2">Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_3" data-id="C112_3">Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_4" data-id="C112_4">Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_5" data-id="C112_5">And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_6" data-id="C112_6">And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_7" data-id="C112_7">But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_8" data-id="C112_8">For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_9" data-id="C112_9">To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_10" data-id="C112_10">To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_11" data-id="C112_11">But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_12" data-id="C112_12">For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_13" data-id="C112_13">For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_14" data-id="C112_14">For the body is not one member, but many.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_15" data-id="C112_15">If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_16" data-id="C112_16">And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_17" data-id="C112_17">If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_18" data-id="C112_18">But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_19" data-id="C112_19">And if they were all one member, where were the body?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_20" data-id="C112_20">But now are they many members, yet but one body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_21" data-id="C112_21">And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_22" data-id="C112_22">Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_23" data-id="C112_23">And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_24" data-id="C112_24">For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_25" data-id="C112_25">That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_26" data-id="C112_26">And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_27" data-id="C112_27">Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_28" data-id="C112_28">And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_29" data-id="C112_29">Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_30" data-id="C112_30">Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_31" data-id="C112_31">But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.</span>
