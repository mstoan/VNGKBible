<div class="c">3</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS3_1" data-id="WS3_1">But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and there shall no torment touch them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS3_2" data-id="WS3_2">In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die: and their departure is taken for misery,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS3_3" data-id="WS3_3">And their going from us to be utter destruction: but they are in peace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS3_4" data-id="WS3_4">For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is their hope full of immortality.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS3_5" data-id="WS3_5">And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded: for God proved them, and found them worthy for himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS3_6" data-id="WS3_6">As gold in the furnace hath he tried them, and received them as a burnt offering.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS3_7" data-id="WS3_7">And in the time of their visitation they shall shine, and run to and fro like sparks among the stubble.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS3_8" data-id="WS3_8">They shall judge the nations, and have dominion over the people, and their Lord shall reign for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS3_9" data-id="WS3_9">They that put their trust in him shall understand the truth: and such as be faithful in love shall abide with him: for grace and mercy is to his saints, and he hath care for his elect.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS3_10" data-id="WS3_10">But the ungodly shall be punished according to their own imaginations, which have neglected the righteous, and forsaken the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS3_11" data-id="WS3_11">For whoso despiseth wisdom and nurture, he is miserable, and their hope is vain, their labours unfruitful, and their works unprofitable:</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS3_12" data-id="WS3_12">Their wives are foolish, and their children wicked:</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS3_13" data-id="WS3_13">Their offspring is cursed. Wherefore blessed is the barren that is undefiled, which hath not known the sinful bed: she shall have fruit in the visitation of souls.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS3_14" data-id="WS3_14">And blessed is the eunuch, which with his hands hath wrought no iniquity, nor imagined wicked things against God: for unto him shall be given the special gift of faith, and an inheritance in the temple of the Lord more acceptable to his mind.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS3_15" data-id="WS3_15">For glorious is the fruit of good labours: and the root of wisdom shall never fall away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS3_16" data-id="WS3_16">As for the children of adulterers, they shall not come to their perfection, and the seed of an unrighteous bed shall be rooted out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS3_17" data-id="WS3_17">For though they live long, yet shall they be nothing regarded: and their last age shall be without honour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS3_18" data-id="WS3_18">Or, if they die quickly, they have no hope, neither comfort in the day of trial.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS3_19" data-id="WS3_19">For horrible is the end of the unrighteous generation.</span>
