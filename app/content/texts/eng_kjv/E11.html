<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v E11_3" data-id="E11_3">And he spake unto the Levites, the holy ministers of Israel, that they should hallow themselves unto the Lord, to set the holy ark of the Lord in the house that king Solomon the son of David had built:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v E11_4" data-id="E11_4">And said, Ye shall no more bear the ark upon your shoulders: now therefore serve the Lord your God, and minister unto his people Israel, and prepare you after your families and kindreds,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v E11_5" data-id="E11_5">According as David the king of Israel prescribed, and according to the magnificence of Solomon his son: and standing in the temple according to the several dignity of the families of you the Levites, who minister in the presence of your brethren the children of Israel,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v E11_6" data-id="E11_6">Offer the passover in order, and make ready the sacrifices for your brethren, and keep the passover according to the commandment of the Lord, which was given unto Moses.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v E11_14" data-id="E11_14">For the priests offered the fat until night: and the Levites prepared for themselves, and the priests their brethren, the sons of Aaron.</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v E11_17" data-id="E11_17">Thus were the things that belonged to the sacrifices of the Lord accomplished in that day, that they might hold the passover,</span>

<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v E11_20" data-id="E11_20">And such a passover was not kept in Israel since the time of the prophet Samuel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v E11_21" data-id="E11_21">Yea, all the kings of Israel held not such a passover as Josias, and the priests, and the Levites, and the Jews, held with all Israel that were found dwelling at Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v E11_22" data-id="E11_22">In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josias was this passover kept.</span>

<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v E11_27" data-id="E11_27">I am not sent out from the Lord God against thee; for my war is upon Euphrates: and now the Lord is with me, yea, the Lord is with me hasting me forward: depart from me, and be not against the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v E11_28" data-id="E11_28">Howbeit Josias did not turn back his chariot from him, but undertook to fight with him, not regarding the words of the prophet Jeremy spoken by the mouth of the Lord:</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v E11_29" data-id="E11_29">But joined battle with him in the plain of Magiddo, and the princes came against king Josias.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v E11_30" data-id="E11_30">Then said the king unto his servants, Carry me away out of the battle; for I am very weak. And immediately his servants took him away out of the battle.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v E11_31" data-id="E11_31">Then gat he up upon his second chariot; and being brought back to Jerusalem died, and was buried in his father's sepulchre.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v E11_32" data-id="E11_32">And in all Jewry they mourned for Josias, yea, Jeremy the prophet lamented for Josias, and the chief men with the women made lamentation for him unto this day: and this was given out for an ordinance to be done continually in all the nation of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v E11_33" data-id="E11_33">These things are written in the book of the stories of the kings of Judah, and every one of the acts that Josias did, and his glory, and his understanding in the law of the Lord, and the things that he had done before, and the things now recited, are reported in the book of the kings of Israel and Judea.</span>

<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v E11_35" data-id="E11_35">And he reigned in Judea and in Jerusalem three months: and then the king of Egypt deposed him from reigning in Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v E11_36" data-id="E11_36">And he set a tax upon the land of an hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v E11_37" data-id="E11_37">The king of Egypt also made king Joacim his brother king of Judea and Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v E11_38" data-id="E11_38">And he bound Joacim and the nobles: but Zaraces his brother he apprehended, and brought him out of Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v E11_39" data-id="E11_39">Five and twenty years old was Joacim when he was made king in the land of Judea and Jerusalem; and he did evil before the Lord.</span>
