<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v K212_2" data-id="K212_2">And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v K212_3" data-id="K212_3">But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v K212_4" data-id="K212_4">And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD, even the money of every one that passeth the account, the money that every man is set at, and all the money that cometh into any man's heart to bring into the house of the LORD,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v K212_5" data-id="K212_5">Let the priests take it to them, every man of his acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v K212_7" data-id="K212_7">Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the other priests , and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v K212_8" data-id="K212_8">And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v K212_9" data-id="K212_9">But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v K212_10" data-id="K212_10">And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the house of the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v K212_11" data-id="K212_11">And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the house of the LORD,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v K212_12" data-id="K212_12">And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v K212_14" data-id="K212_14">But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the house of the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v K212_15" data-id="K212_15">Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt faithfully.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v K212_16" data-id="K212_16">The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the LORD: it was the priests'.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v K212_17" data-id="K212_17">Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v K212_18" data-id="K212_18">And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v K212_19" data-id="K212_19">And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span>
