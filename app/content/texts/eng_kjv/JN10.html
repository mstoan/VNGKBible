<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_2" data-id="JN10_2">But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_3" data-id="JN10_3">To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_4" data-id="JN10_4">And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_5" data-id="JN10_5">And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_6" data-id="JN10_6">This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_7" data-id="JN10_7">Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_8" data-id="JN10_8">All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_9" data-id="JN10_9">I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_10" data-id="JN10_10">The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_11" data-id="JN10_11">I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_12" data-id="JN10_12">But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_13" data-id="JN10_13">The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_15" data-id="JN10_15">As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_16" data-id="JN10_16">And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_17" data-id="JN10_17">Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_18" data-id="JN10_18">No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_19" data-id="JN10_19">There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_20" data-id="JN10_20">And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_21" data-id="JN10_21">Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_22" data-id="JN10_22">And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_23" data-id="JN10_23">And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_24" data-id="JN10_24">Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_25" data-id="JN10_25">Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_26" data-id="JN10_26">But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_27" data-id="JN10_27">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_28" data-id="JN10_28">And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_29" data-id="JN10_29">My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_30" data-id="JN10_30">I and my Father are one.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_31" data-id="JN10_31">Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_32" data-id="JN10_32">Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_33" data-id="JN10_33">The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_34" data-id="JN10_34">Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_35" data-id="JN10_35">If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_36" data-id="JN10_36">Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_37" data-id="JN10_37">If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_38" data-id="JN10_38">But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_39" data-id="JN10_39">Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_40" data-id="JN10_40">And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_41" data-id="JN10_41">And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_42" data-id="JN10_42">And many believed on him there.</span>
