<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS65_2" data-id="IS65_2">I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS65_3" data-id="IS65_3">A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS65_4" data-id="IS65_4">Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS65_5" data-id="IS65_5">Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS65_6" data-id="IS65_6">Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS65_7" data-id="IS65_7">Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS65_8" data-id="IS65_8">Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS65_9" data-id="IS65_9">And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS65_10" data-id="IS65_10">And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS65_11" data-id="IS65_11">But ye are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS65_12" data-id="IS65_12">Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS65_13" data-id="IS65_13">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS65_14" data-id="IS65_14">Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS65_15" data-id="IS65_15">And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name:</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS65_16" data-id="IS65_16">That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS65_17" data-id="IS65_17">For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS65_18" data-id="IS65_18">But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS65_19" data-id="IS65_19">And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS65_20" data-id="IS65_20">There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS65_21" data-id="IS65_21">And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS65_22" data-id="IS65_22">They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS65_23" data-id="IS65_23">They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS65_24" data-id="IS65_24">And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS65_25" data-id="IS65_25">The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.</span>
