<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR6_2" data-id="PR6_2">Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR6_3" data-id="PR6_3">Do this now, my son, deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR6_4" data-id="PR6_4">Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR6_5" data-id="PR6_5">Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR6_6" data-id="PR6_6">Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR6_7" data-id="PR6_7">Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR6_8" data-id="PR6_8">Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR6_9" data-id="PR6_9">How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR6_10" data-id="PR6_10">Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR6_11" data-id="PR6_11">So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR6_12" data-id="PR6_12">A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR6_13" data-id="PR6_13">He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR6_17" data-id="PR6_17">A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR6_18" data-id="PR6_18">An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR6_19" data-id="PR6_19">A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR6_20" data-id="PR6_20">My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR6_22" data-id="PR6_22">When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR6_23" data-id="PR6_23">For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR6_24" data-id="PR6_24">To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR6_25" data-id="PR6_25">Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR6_26" data-id="PR6_26">For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.</span>

<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR6_32" data-id="PR6_32">But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR6_33" data-id="PR6_33">A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR6_34" data-id="PR6_34">For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</span>
