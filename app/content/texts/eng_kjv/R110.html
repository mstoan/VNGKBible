<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R110_5" data-id="R110_5">And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R110_6" data-id="R110_6">So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.</span>
