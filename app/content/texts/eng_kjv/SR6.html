<div class="c">6</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_1" data-id="SR6_1">Instead of a friend become not an enemy; for [thereby] thou shalt inherit an ill name, shame, and reproach: even so shall a sinner that hath a double tongue.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_2" data-id="SR6_2">Extol not thyself in the counsel of thine own heart; that thy soul be not torn in pieces as a bull [straying alone.]</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_3" data-id="SR6_3">Thou shalt eat up thy leaves, and lose thy fruit, and leave thyself as a dry tree.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_4" data-id="SR6_4">A wicked soul shall destroy him that hath it, and shall make him to be laughed to scorn of his enemies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_5" data-id="SR6_5">Sweet language will multiply friends: and a fairspeaking tongue will increase kind greetings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_6" data-id="SR6_6">Be in peace with many: nevertheless have but one counsellor of a thousand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_7" data-id="SR6_7">If thou wouldest get a friend, prove him first and be not hasty to credit him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_8" data-id="SR6_8">For some man is a friend for his own occasion, and will not abide in the day of thy trouble.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_9" data-id="SR6_9">And there is a friend, who being turned to enmity, and strife will discover thy reproach.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_10" data-id="SR6_10">Again, some friend is a companion at the table, and will not continue in the day of thy affliction.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_11" data-id="SR6_11">But in thy prosperity he will be as thyself, and will be bold over thy servants.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_12" data-id="SR6_12">If thou be brought low, he will be against thee, and will hide himself from thy face.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_13" data-id="SR6_13">Separate thyself from thine enemies, and take heed of thy friends.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_14" data-id="SR6_14">A faithfu1l friend is a strong defence: and he that hath found such an one hath found a treasure.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_15" data-id="SR6_15">Nothing doth countervail a faithful friend, and his excellency is invaluable.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_16" data-id="SR6_16">A faithful friend is the medicine of life; and they that fear the Lord shall find him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_17" data-id="SR6_17">Whoso feareth the Lord shall direct his friendship aright: for as he is, so shall his neighbour be also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_18" data-id="SR6_18">My son, gather instruction from thy youth up: so shalt thou find wisdom till thine old age.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_19" data-id="SR6_19">Come unto her as one that ploweth and soweth, and wait for her good fruits: for thou shalt not toil much in labouring about her, but thou shalt eat of her fruits right soon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_20" data-id="SR6_20">She is very unpleasant to the unlearned: he that is without understanding will not remain with her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_21" data-id="SR6_21">She will lie upon him as a mighty stone of trial; and he will cast her from him ere it be long.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_22" data-id="SR6_22">For wisdom is according to her name, and she is not manifest unto many.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_23" data-id="SR6_23">Give ear, my son, receive my advice, and refuse not my counsel,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_24" data-id="SR6_24">And put thy feet into her fetters, and thy neck into her chain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_25" data-id="SR6_25">Bow down thy shoulder, and bear her, and be not grieved with her bonds.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_26" data-id="SR6_26">Come unto her with thy whole heart, and keep her ways with all thy power.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_27" data-id="SR6_27">Search, and seek, and she shall be made known unto thee: and when thou hast got hold of her, let her not go.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_28" data-id="SR6_28">For at the last thou shalt find her rest, and that shall be turned to thy joy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_29" data-id="SR6_29">Then shall her fetters be a strong defence for thee, and her chains a robe of glory.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_30" data-id="SR6_30">For there is a golden ornament upon her, and her bands are purple lace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_31" data-id="SR6_31">Thou shalt put her on as a robe of honour, and shalt put her about thee as a crown of joy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_32" data-id="SR6_32">My son, if thou wilt, thou shalt be taught: and if thou wilt apply thy mind, thou shalt be prudent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_33" data-id="SR6_33">If thou love to hear, thou shalt receive understanding: and if thou bow thine ear, thou shalt be wise,</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_34" data-id="SR6_34">Stand in the multitude of the elders; and cleave unto him that is wise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_35" data-id="SR6_35">Be willing to hear every godly discourse; and let not the parables of understanding escape thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_36" data-id="SR6_36">And if thou seest a man of understanding, get thee betimes unto him, and let thy foot wear the steps of his door.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR6_37" data-id="SR6_37">Let thy mind be upon the ordinances of the Lord and meditate continually in his commandments: he shall establish thine heart, and give thee wisdom at thine owns desire.</span>
