<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_2" data-id="ML1_2">I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_3" data-id="ML1_3">And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_4" data-id="ML1_4">Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_5" data-id="ML1_5">And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_6" data-id="ML1_6">A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_7" data-id="ML1_7">Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD is contemptible.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_8" data-id="ML1_8">And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_9" data-id="ML1_9">And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the LORD of hosts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_10" data-id="ML1_10">Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought? neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_11" data-id="ML1_11">For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_12" data-id="ML1_12">But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_13" data-id="ML1_13">Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_14" data-id="ML1_14">But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen.</span>
