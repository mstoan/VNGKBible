<div class="c">3</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_1" data-id="SR3_1">Hear me your father, O children, and do thereafter, that ye may be safe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_2" data-id="SR3_2">For the Lord hath given the father honour over the children, and hath confirmed the authority of the mother over the sons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_3" data-id="SR3_3">Whoso honoureth his father maketh an atonement for his sins:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_4" data-id="SR3_4">And he that honoureth his mother is as one that layeth up treasure.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_5" data-id="SR3_5">Whoso honoureth his father shall have joy of his own children; and when he maketh his prayer, he shall be heard.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_6" data-id="SR3_6">He that honoureth his father shall have a long life; and he that is obedient unto the Lord shall be a comfort to his mother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_7" data-id="SR3_7">He that feareth the Lord will honour his father, and will do service unto his parents, as to his masters.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_8" data-id="SR3_8">Honour thy father and mother both in word and deed, that a blessing may come upon thee from them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_9" data-id="SR3_9">For the blessing of the father establisheth the houses of children; but the curse of the mother rooteth out foundations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_10" data-id="SR3_10">Glory not in the dishonour of thy father; for thy father's dishonour is no glory unto thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_11" data-id="SR3_11">For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father; and a mother in dishonour is a reproach to the children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_12" data-id="SR3_12">My son, help thy father in his age, and grieve him not as long as he liveth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_13" data-id="SR3_13">And if his understanding fail, have patience with him; and despise him not when thou art in thy full strength.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_14" data-id="SR3_14">For the relieving of thy father shall not be forgotten: and instead of sins it shall be added to build thee up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_15" data-id="SR3_15">In the day of thine affliction it shall be remembered; thy sins also shall melt away, as the ice in the fair warm weather.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_16" data-id="SR3_16">He that forsaketh his father is as a blasphemer; and he that angereth his mother is cursed: of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_17" data-id="SR3_17">My son, go on with thy business in meekness; so shalt thou be beloved of him that is approved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_18" data-id="SR3_18">The greater thou art, the more humble thyself, and thou shalt find favour before the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_19" data-id="SR3_19">Many are in high place, and of renown: but mysteries are revealed unto the meek.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_20" data-id="SR3_20">For the power of the Lord is great, and he is honoured of the lowly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_21" data-id="SR3_21">Seek not out things that are too hard for thee, neither search the things that are above thy strength.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_22" data-id="SR3_22">But what is commanded thee, think thereupon with reverence, for it is not needful for thee to see with thine eyes the things that are in secret.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_23" data-id="SR3_23">Be not curious in unnecessary matters: for more things are shewed unto thee than men understand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_24" data-id="SR3_24">For many are deceived by their own vain opinion; and an evil suspicion hath overthrown their judgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_25" data-id="SR3_25">Without eyes thou shalt want light: profess not the knowledge therefore that thou hast not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_26" data-id="SR3_26">A stubborn heart shall fare evil at the last; and he that loveth danger shall perish therein.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_27" data-id="SR3_27">An obstinate heart shall be laden with sorrows; and the wicked man shall heap sin upon sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_28" data-id="SR3_28">In the punishment of the proud there is no remedy; for the plant of wickedness hath taken root in him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_29" data-id="SR3_29">The heart of the prudent will understand a parable; and an attentive ear is the desire of a wise man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_30" data-id="SR3_30">Water will quench a flaming fire; and alms maketh an atonement for sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v SR3_31" data-id="SR3_31">And he that requiteth good turns is mindful of that which may come hereafter; and when he falleth, he shall find a stay.</span>
