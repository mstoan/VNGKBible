<div class="c">7</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM7_1" data-id="RM7_1">Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM7_2" data-id="RM7_2">For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM7_3" data-id="RM7_3">So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM7_4" data-id="RM7_4">Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM7_5" data-id="RM7_5">For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM7_6" data-id="RM7_6">But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM7_7" data-id="RM7_7">What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM7_8" data-id="RM7_8">But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM7_9" data-id="RM7_9">For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM7_10" data-id="RM7_10">And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM7_11" data-id="RM7_11">For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM7_12" data-id="RM7_12">Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM7_13" data-id="RM7_13">Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM7_14" data-id="RM7_14">For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM7_15" data-id="RM7_15">For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM7_16" data-id="RM7_16">If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM7_17" data-id="RM7_17">Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM7_18" data-id="RM7_18">For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM7_19" data-id="RM7_19">For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM7_20" data-id="RM7_20">Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM7_21" data-id="RM7_21">I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM7_22" data-id="RM7_22">For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM7_23" data-id="RM7_23">But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM7_24" data-id="RM7_24">O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM7_25" data-id="RM7_25">I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.</span>
