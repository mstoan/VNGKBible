<div class="c">15</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS15_1" data-id="WS15_1">But thou, O God, art gracious and true, longsuffering, and in mercy ordering all things,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS15_2" data-id="WS15_2">For if we sin, we are thine, knowing thy power: but we will not sin, knowing that we are counted thine.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS15_3" data-id="WS15_3">For to know thee is perfect righteousness: yea, to know thy power is the root of immortality.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS15_4" data-id="WS15_4">For neither did the mischievous invention of men deceive us, nor an image spotted with divers colours, the painter's fruitless labour;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS15_5" data-id="WS15_5">The sight whereof enticeth fools to lust after it, and so they desire the form of a dead image, that hath no breath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS15_6" data-id="WS15_6">Both they that make them, they that desire them, and they that worship them, are lovers of evil things, and are worthy to have such things to trust upon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS15_7" data-id="WS15_7">For the potter, tempering soft earth, fashioneth every vessel with much labour for our service: yea, of the same clay he maketh both the vessels that serve for clean uses, and likewise also all such as serve to the contrary: but what is the use of either sort, the potter himself is the judge.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS15_8" data-id="WS15_8">And employing his labours lewdly, he maketh a vain god of the same clay, even he which a little before was made of earth himself, and within a little while after returneth to the same, out when his life which was lent him shall be demanded.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS15_9" data-id="WS15_9">Notwithstanding his care is, not that he shall have much labour, nor that his life is short: but striveth to excel goldsmiths and silversmiths, and endeavoureth to do like the workers in brass, and counteth it his glory to make counterfeit things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS15_10" data-id="WS15_10">His heart is ashes, his hope is more vile than earth, and his life of less value than clay:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS15_11" data-id="WS15_11">Forasmuch as he knew not his Maker, and him that inspired into him an active soul, and breathed in a living spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS15_12" data-id="WS15_12">But they counted our life a pastime, and our time here a market for gain: for, say they, we must be getting every way, though it be by evil means.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS15_13" data-id="WS15_13">For this man, that of earthly matter maketh brittle vessels and graven images, knoweth himself to offend above all others.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS15_14" data-id="WS15_14">And all the enemies of thy people, that hold them in subjection, are most foolish, and are more miserable than very babes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS15_15" data-id="WS15_15">For they counted all the idols of the heathen to be gods: which neither have the use of eyes to see, nor noses to draw breath, nor ears to hear, nor fingers of hands to handle; and as for their feet, they are slow to go.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS15_16" data-id="WS15_16">For man made them, and he that borrowed his own spirit fashioned them: but no man can make a god like unto himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS15_17" data-id="WS15_17">For being mortal, he worketh a dead thing with wicked hands: for he himself is better than the things which he worshippeth: whereas he lived once, but they never.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS15_18" data-id="WS15_18">Yea, they worshipped those beasts also that are most hateful: for being compared together, some are worse than others.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v WS15_19" data-id="WS15_19">Neither are they beautiful, so much as to be desired in respect of beasts: but they went without the praise of God and his blessing.</span>
