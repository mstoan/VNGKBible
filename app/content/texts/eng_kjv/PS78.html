<div class="c">78</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_1" data-id="PS78_1">Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_2" data-id="PS78_2">I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_3" data-id="PS78_3">Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_4" data-id="PS78_4">We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_5" data-id="PS78_5">For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_6" data-id="PS78_6">That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_7" data-id="PS78_7">That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_8" data-id="PS78_8">And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_9" data-id="PS78_9">The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_10" data-id="PS78_10">They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_11" data-id="PS78_11">And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_12" data-id="PS78_12">Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_13" data-id="PS78_13">He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_14" data-id="PS78_14">In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_15" data-id="PS78_15">He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_16" data-id="PS78_16">He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_17" data-id="PS78_17">And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_18" data-id="PS78_18">And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_19" data-id="PS78_19">Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_20" data-id="PS78_20">Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_21" data-id="PS78_21">Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_22" data-id="PS78_22">Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_23" data-id="PS78_23">Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_24" data-id="PS78_24">And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_25" data-id="PS78_25">Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_26" data-id="PS78_26">He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_27" data-id="PS78_27">He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_28" data-id="PS78_28">And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_29" data-id="PS78_29">So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_30" data-id="PS78_30">They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_31" data-id="PS78_31">The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_32" data-id="PS78_32">For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_33" data-id="PS78_33">Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_34" data-id="PS78_34">When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and inquired early after God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_35" data-id="PS78_35">And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_36" data-id="PS78_36">Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_37" data-id="PS78_37">For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_38" data-id="PS78_38">But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_39" data-id="PS78_39">For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_40" data-id="PS78_40">How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_41" data-id="PS78_41">Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_42" data-id="PS78_42">They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_43" data-id="PS78_43">How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_44" data-id="PS78_44">And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_45" data-id="PS78_45">He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_46" data-id="PS78_46">He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_47" data-id="PS78_47">He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_48" data-id="PS78_48">He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_49" data-id="PS78_49">He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_50" data-id="PS78_50">He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_51" data-id="PS78_51">And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_52" data-id="PS78_52">But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_53" data-id="PS78_53">And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_54" data-id="PS78_54">And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.</span>
<span class="v-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_55" data-id="PS78_55">He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</span>
<span class="v-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_56" data-id="PS78_56">Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</span>
<span class="v-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_57" data-id="PS78_57">But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</span>
<span class="v-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_58" data-id="PS78_58">For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</span>
<span class="v-num v-59">59&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_59" data-id="PS78_59">When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</span>
<span class="v-num v-60">60&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_60" data-id="PS78_60">So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;</span>
<span class="v-num v-61">61&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_61" data-id="PS78_61">And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-62">62&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_62" data-id="PS78_62">He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-63">63&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_63" data-id="PS78_63">The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.</span>
<span class="v-num v-64">64&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_64" data-id="PS78_64">Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-65">65&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_65" data-id="PS78_65">Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</span>
<span class="v-num v-66">66&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_66" data-id="PS78_66">And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</span>
<span class="v-num v-67">67&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_67" data-id="PS78_67">Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</span>
<span class="v-num v-68">68&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_68" data-id="PS78_68">But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-69">69&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_69" data-id="PS78_69">And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-70">70&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_70" data-id="PS78_70">He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</span>
<span class="v-num v-71">71&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_71" data-id="PS78_71">From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-72">72&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_72" data-id="PS78_72">So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.</span>
