<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU27_2" data-id="NU27_2">And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU27_3" data-id="NU27_3">Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU27_4" data-id="NU27_4">Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU27_7" data-id="NU27_7">The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU27_8" data-id="NU27_8">And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU27_9" data-id="NU27_9">And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren.</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU27_12" data-id="NU27_12">And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU27_13" data-id="NU27_13">And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU27_14" data-id="NU27_14">For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU27_15" data-id="NU27_15">And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying,</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU27_17" data-id="NU27_17">Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU27_18" data-id="NU27_18">And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU27_19" data-id="NU27_19">And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU27_20" data-id="NU27_20">And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.</span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU27_22" data-id="NU27_22">And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU27_23" data-id="NU27_23">And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.</span>
