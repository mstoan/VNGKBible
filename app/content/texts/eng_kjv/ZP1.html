<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_2" data-id="ZP1_2">I will utterly consume all things from off the land, saith the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_3" data-id="ZP1_3">I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_4" data-id="ZP1_4">I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarims with the priests;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_5" data-id="ZP1_5">And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship and that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_6" data-id="ZP1_6">And them that are turned back from the LORD; and those that have not sought the LORD, nor inquired for him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_7" data-id="ZP1_7">Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of the LORD is at hand: for the LORD hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath bid his guests.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_8" data-id="ZP1_8">And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD's sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king's children, and all such as are clothed with strange apparel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_9" data-id="ZP1_9">In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold, which fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_10" data-id="ZP1_10">And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and an howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_11" data-id="ZP1_11">Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_12" data-id="ZP1_12">And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees: that say in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_13" data-id="ZP1_13">Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_14" data-id="ZP1_14">The great day of the LORD is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_15" data-id="ZP1_15">That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_16" data-id="ZP1_16">A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_17" data-id="ZP1_17">And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_18" data-id="ZP1_18">Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD's wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.</span>
