<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_2" data-id="EK7_2">Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_3" data-id="EK7_3">Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_4" data-id="EK7_4">And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_5" data-id="EK7_5">Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_6" data-id="EK7_6">An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_7" data-id="EK7_7">The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the mountains.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_8" data-id="EK7_8">Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_9" data-id="EK7_9">And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the LORD that smiteth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_10" data-id="EK7_10">Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_11" data-id="EK7_11">Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither shall there be wailing for them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_12" data-id="EK7_12">The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_13" data-id="EK7_13">For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_14" data-id="EK7_14">They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_15" data-id="EK7_15">The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_16" data-id="EK7_16">But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_17" data-id="EK7_17">All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_18" data-id="EK7_18">They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_19" data-id="EK7_19">They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_20" data-id="EK7_20">As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_21" data-id="EK7_21">And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_22" data-id="EK7_22">My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_23" data-id="EK7_23">Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_24" data-id="EK7_24">Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_25" data-id="EK7_25">Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_26" data-id="EK7_26">Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_27" data-id="EK7_27">The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.</span>
