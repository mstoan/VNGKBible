<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_3" data-id="ZP2_3">Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORD's anger.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_4" data-id="ZP2_4">For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_5" data-id="ZP2_5">Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD is against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_6" data-id="ZP2_6">And the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for shepherds, and folds for flocks.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_7" data-id="ZP2_7">And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away their captivity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_8" data-id="ZP2_8">I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_14" data-id="ZP2_14">And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds: for he shall uncover the cedar work.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_15" data-id="ZP2_15">This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.</span>
