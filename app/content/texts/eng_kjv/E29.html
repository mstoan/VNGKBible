<div class="c">9</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_1" data-id="E29_1">He answered me then, and said, Measure thou the time diligently in itself: and when thou seest part of the signs past, which I have told thee before,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_2" data-id="E29_2">Then shalt thou understand, that it is the very same time, wherein the Highest will begin to visit the world which he made.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_3" data-id="E29_3">Therefore when there shall be seen earthquakes and uproars of the people in the world:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_4" data-id="E29_4">Then shalt thou well understand, that the most High spake of those things from the days that were before thee, even from the beginning.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_5" data-id="E29_5">For like as all that is made in the world hath a beginning and an end, and the end is manifest:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_6" data-id="E29_6">Even so the times also of the Highest have plain beginnings in wonder and powerful works, and endings in effects and signs.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_7" data-id="E29_7">And every one that shall be saved, and shall be able to escape by his works, and by faith, whereby ye have believed,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_8" data-id="E29_8">Shall be preserved from the said perils, and shall see my salvation in my land, and within my borders: for I have sanctified them for me from the beginning.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_9" data-id="E29_9">Then shall they be in pitiful case, which now have abused my ways: and they that have cast them away despitefully shall dwell in torments.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_10" data-id="E29_10">For such as in their life have received benefits, and have not known me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_11" data-id="E29_11">And they that have loathed my law, while they had yet liberty, and, when as yet place of repentance was open unto them, understood not, but despised it;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_12" data-id="E29_12">The same must know it after death by pain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_13" data-id="E29_13">And therefore be thou not curious how the ungodly shall be punished, and when: but enquire how the righteous shall be saved, whose the world is, and for whom the world is created.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_14" data-id="E29_14">Then answered I and said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_15" data-id="E29_15">I have said before, and now do speak, and will speak it also hereafter, that there be many more of them which perish, than of them which shall be saved:</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_16" data-id="E29_16">Like as a wave is greater than a drop.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_17" data-id="E29_17">And he answered me, saying, Like as the field is, so is also the seed; as the flowers be, such are the colours also; such as the workman is, such also is the work; and as the husbandman ls himself, so is his husbandry also: for it was the time of the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_18" data-id="E29_18">And now when I prepared the world, which was not yet made, even for them to dwell in that now live, no man spake against me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_19" data-id="E29_19">For then every one obeyed: but now the manners of them which are created in this world that is made are corrupted by a perpetual seed, and by a law which is unsearchable rid themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_20" data-id="E29_20">So I considered the world, and, behold, there was peril because of the devices that were come into it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_21" data-id="E29_21">And I saw, and spared it greatly, and have kept me a grape of the cluster, and a plant of a great people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_22" data-id="E29_22">Let the multitude perish then, which was born in vain; and let my grape be kept, and my plant; for with great labour have I made it perfect.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_23" data-id="E29_23">Nevertheless, if thou wilt cease yet seven days more, (but thou shalt not fast in them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_24" data-id="E29_24">But go into a field of flowers, where no house is builded, and eat only the flowers of the field; taste no flesh, drink no wine, but eat flowers only;)</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_25" data-id="E29_25">And pray unto the Highest continually, then will I come and talk with thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_26" data-id="E29_26">So I went my way into the field which is called Ardath, like as he commanded me; and there I sat among the flowers, and did eat of the herbs of the field, and the meat of the same satisfied me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_27" data-id="E29_27">After seven days I sat upon the grass, and my heart was vexed within me, like as before:</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_28" data-id="E29_28">And I opened my mouth, and began to talk before the most High, and said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_29" data-id="E29_29">O Lord, thou that shewest thyself unto us, thou wast shewed unto our fathers in the wilderness, in a place where no man treadeth, in a barren place, when they came out of Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_30" data-id="E29_30">And thou spakest saying, Hear me, O Israel; and mark my words, thou seed of Jacob.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_31" data-id="E29_31">For, behold, I sow my law in you, and it shall bring fruit in you, and ye shall be honoured in it for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_32" data-id="E29_32">But our fathers, which received the law, kept it not, and observed not thy ordinances: and though the fruit of thy law did not perish, neither could it, for it was thine;</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_33" data-id="E29_33">Yet they that received it perished, because they kept not the thing that was sown in them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_34" data-id="E29_34">And, lo, it ls a custom, when the ground hath received seed, or the sea a ship, or any vessel meat or drink, that, that being perished wherein it was sown or cast into,</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_35" data-id="E29_35">That thing also which was sown, or cast therein, or received, doth perish, and remaineth not with us: but with us it hath not happened so.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_36" data-id="E29_36">For we that have received the law perish by sin, and our heart also which received it</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_37" data-id="E29_37">Notwithstanding the law perisheth not, but remaineth in his force.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_38" data-id="E29_38">And when I spake these things in my heart, I looked back with mine eyes, and upon the right side I saw a woman, and, behold, she mourned and wept with a loud voice, and was much grieved in heart, and her clothes were rent, and she had ashes upon her head.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_39" data-id="E29_39">Then let I my thoughts go that I was in, and turned me unto her,</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_40" data-id="E29_40">And said unto her, Wherefore weepest thou? why art thou so grieved in thy mind?</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_41" data-id="E29_41">And she said unto me, Sir, let me alone, that I may bewail myself, and add unto my sorrow, for I am sore vexed in my mind, and brought very low.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_42" data-id="E29_42">And I said unto her, What aileth thee? tell me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_43" data-id="E29_43">She said unto me, I thy servant have been barren, and had no child, though I had an husband thirty years,</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_44" data-id="E29_44">And those thirty years I did nothing else day and night, and every hour, but make my, prayer to the Highest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_45" data-id="E29_45">After thirty years God heard me thine handmaid, looked upon my misery, considered my trouble, and gave me a son: and I was very glad of him, so was my husband also, and all my neighbours: and we gave great honour unto the Almighty.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_46" data-id="E29_46">And I nourished him with great travail.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v E29_47" data-id="E29_47">So when he grew up, and came to the time that he should have a wife, I made a feast.</span>
