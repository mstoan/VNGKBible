<div class="c">3</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_1" data-id="S13_1">And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_2" data-id="S13_2">And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_3" data-id="S13_3">And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_4" data-id="S13_4">That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_5" data-id="S13_5">And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_6" data-id="S13_6">And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_7" data-id="S13_7">Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_8" data-id="S13_8">And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_9" data-id="S13_9">Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_10" data-id="S13_10">And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_11" data-id="S13_11">And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_12" data-id="S13_12">In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_13" data-id="S13_13">For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_14" data-id="S13_14">And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_15" data-id="S13_15">And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_16" data-id="S13_16">Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_17" data-id="S13_17">And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_18" data-id="S13_18">And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_19" data-id="S13_19">And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_20" data-id="S13_20">And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_21" data-id="S13_21">And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</span>
