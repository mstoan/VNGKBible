<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_7" data-id="LK2_7">And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_8" data-id="LK2_8">And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_9" data-id="LK2_9">And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_10" data-id="LK2_10">And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_11" data-id="LK2_11">For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.</span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_13" data-id="LK2_13">And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_14" data-id="LK2_14">Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.</span>

<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_37" data-id="LK2_37">And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_38" data-id="LK2_38">And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_39" data-id="LK2_39">And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_40" data-id="LK2_40">And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_41" data-id="LK2_41">Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_42" data-id="LK2_42">And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_43" data-id="LK2_43">And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it.</span>
