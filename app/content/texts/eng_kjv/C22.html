<div class="c">2</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_1" data-id="C22_1">But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_2" data-id="C22_2">For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_3" data-id="C22_3">And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_4" data-id="C22_4">For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_5" data-id="C22_5">But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_6" data-id="C22_6">Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_7" data-id="C22_7">So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_8" data-id="C22_8">Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_9" data-id="C22_9">For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_10" data-id="C22_10">To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_11" data-id="C22_11">Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_12" data-id="C22_12">Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_13" data-id="C22_13">I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_14" data-id="C22_14">Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_15" data-id="C22_15">For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_16" data-id="C22_16">To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_17" data-id="C22_17">For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.</span>
