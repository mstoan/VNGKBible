<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU25_3" data-id="NU25_3">And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU25_4" data-id="NU25_4">And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU25_5" data-id="NU25_5">And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baal-peor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU25_6" data-id="NU25_6">And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span>
