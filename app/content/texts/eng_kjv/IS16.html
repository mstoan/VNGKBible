<div class="c">16</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS16_1" data-id="IS16_1">Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS16_2" data-id="IS16_2">For it shall be, that, as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, so the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS16_3" data-id="IS16_3">Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS16_4" data-id="IS16_4">Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS16_5" data-id="IS16_5">And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS16_6" data-id="IS16_6">We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies shall not be so.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS16_7" data-id="IS16_7">Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kir-hareseth shall ye mourn; surely they are stricken.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS16_8" data-id="IS16_8">For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come even unto Jazer, they wandered through the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS16_9" data-id="IS16_9">Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS16_10" data-id="IS16_10">And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses; I have made their vintage shouting to cease.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS16_11" data-id="IS16_11">Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kir-haresh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS16_12" data-id="IS16_12">And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS16_13" data-id="IS16_13">This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since that time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS16_14" data-id="IS16_14">But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and feeble.</span>
