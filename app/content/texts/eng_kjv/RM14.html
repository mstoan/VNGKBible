<div class="c">14</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_1" data-id="RM14_1">Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_2" data-id="RM14_2">For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_3" data-id="RM14_3">Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_4" data-id="RM14_4">Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_5" data-id="RM14_5">One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_6" data-id="RM14_6">He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_7" data-id="RM14_7">For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_8" data-id="RM14_8">For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_9" data-id="RM14_9">For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_10" data-id="RM14_10">But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_11" data-id="RM14_11">For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_12" data-id="RM14_12">So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_13" data-id="RM14_13">Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_14" data-id="RM14_14">I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_15" data-id="RM14_15">But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_16" data-id="RM14_16">Let not then your good be evil spoken of:</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_17" data-id="RM14_17">For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_18" data-id="RM14_18">For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_19" data-id="RM14_19">Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_20" data-id="RM14_20">For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_21" data-id="RM14_21">It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_22" data-id="RM14_22">Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_23" data-id="RM14_23">And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</span>
