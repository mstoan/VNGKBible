<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML2_2" data-id="ML2_2">If ye hearken not, and if ye lay [it] not to heart, To give  honour to My name, said Jehovah of Hosts, I have sent against  you the curse, And I have cursed your blessings, Yea, I have  also cursed it, Because ye are not laying [it] to heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML2_3" data-id="ML2_3">Lo, I am pushing away before you the seed, And have  scattered dung before your faces, Dung of your festivals, And  it hath taken you away with it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML2_4" data-id="ML2_4">And ye have known that I have sent unto you this charge, For  My covenant being with Levi, Said Jehovah of Hosts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML2_5" data-id="ML2_5">My covenant hath been with him of life and of peace, And I  make them to him a fear, and he doth fear Me, And because of My  name he hath been affrighted.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML2_6" data-id="ML2_6">The law of truth hath been in his mouth, And perverseness  hath not been found in his lips, In peace and in uprightness he  walked with Me, And many he brought back from iniquity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML2_7" data-id="ML2_7">For the lips of a priest preserve knowledge, And law they do  seek from his mouth, For a messenger of Jehovah of Hosts he  [is].</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML2_8" data-id="ML2_8">And ye, ye have turned from the way, Ye have caused many to  stumble in the law, Ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi,  Said Jehovah of Hosts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML2_9" data-id="ML2_9">And I also, I have made you despised and low before all the  people, Because ye are not keeping My ways, And are accepting  persons in the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML2_10" data-id="ML2_10">Have we not all one father? Hath not our God prepared us?  Wherefore do we deal treacherously, Each against his brother,  To pollute the covenant of our fathers?</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML2_11" data-id="ML2_11">Dealt treacherously hath Judah, And abomination hath been  done in Israel, and in Jerusalem, For polluted hath Judah the  holy thing of Jehovah, That He hath loved, and hath married the  daughter of a strange god.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML2_12" data-id="ML2_12">Cut off doth Jehovah the man who doth it, Tempter and  tempted -- from the tents of Jacob, Even he who is bringing  nigh a present to Jehovah of Hosts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML2_13" data-id="ML2_13">And this a second time ye do, Covering with tears the altar  of Jehovah, With weeping and groaning, Because there is no more  turning unto the present, Or receiving of a pleasing thing from  your hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML2_14" data-id="ML2_14">And ye have said, `Wherefore?' Because Jehovah hath  testified between thee And the wife of thy youth, That thou  hast dealt treacherously against her, And she thy companion,  and thy covenant-wife.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML2_15" data-id="ML2_15">And He did not make one [only], And He hath the remnant of  the Spirit. And what [is] the one [alone]! He is seeking a  godly seed. And ye have been watchful over your spirit, And  with the wife of thy youth, None doth deal treacherously.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML2_16" data-id="ML2_16">For [I] hate sending away, said Jehovah, God of Israel, And  He [who] hath covered violence with his clothing, said Jehovah  of Hosts, And ye have been watchful over your spirit, And ye do  not deal treacherously.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML2_17" data-id="ML2_17">Ye have wearied Jehovah with your words, And ye have said:  `In what have we wearied Him?' In your saying: `Every evil-doer  [is] good in the eyes of Jehovah, And in them He is  delighting,' Or, `Where [is] the God of judgment?'</span>
