<div class="c">14</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_1" data-id="RM14_1">And him who is weak in the faith receive ye -- not to  determinations of reasonings;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_2" data-id="RM14_2">one doth believe that he may eat all things -- and he who  is weak doth eat herbs;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_3" data-id="RM14_3">let not him who is eating despise him who is not eating:  and let not him who is not eating judge him who is eating, for  God did receive him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_4" data-id="RM14_4">Thou -- who art thou that art judging another's domestic?  to his own master he doth stand or fall; and he shall be made  to stand, for God is able to make him stand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_5" data-id="RM14_5">One doth judge one day above another, and another doth  judge every day [alike]; let each in his own mind be fully  assured.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_6" data-id="RM14_6">He who is regarding the day, to the Lord he doth regard  [it], and he who is not regarding the day, to the Lord he doth  not regard [it]. He who is eating, to the Lord he doth eat,  for he doth give thanks to God; and he who is not eating, to  the Lord he doth not eat, and doth give thanks to God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_7" data-id="RM14_7">For none of us to himself doth live, and none to himself  doth die;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_8" data-id="RM14_8">for both, if we may live, to the Lord we live; if also we  may die, to the Lord we die; both then if we may live, also if  we may die, we are the Lord's;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_9" data-id="RM14_9">for because of this Christ both died and rose again, and  lived again, that both of dead and of living he may be Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_10" data-id="RM14_10">And thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? or again, thou,  why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand  at the tribunal of the Christ;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_11" data-id="RM14_11">for it hath been written, `I live! saith the Lord -- to Me  bow shall every knee, and every tongue shall confess to God;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_12" data-id="RM14_12">so, then, each of us concerning himself shall give  reckoning to God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_13" data-id="RM14_13">no longer, therefore, may we judge one another, but this  judge ye rather, not to put a stumbling-stone before the  brother, or an offence.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_14" data-id="RM14_14">I have known, and am persuaded, in the Lord Jesus, that  nothing [is] unclean of itself, except to him who is reckoning  anything to be unclean -- to that one [it is] unclean;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_15" data-id="RM14_15">and if through victuals thy brother is grieved, no more  dost thou walk according to love; do not with thy victuals  destroy that one for whom Christ died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_16" data-id="RM14_16">Let not, then, your good be evil spoken of,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_17" data-id="RM14_17">for the reign of God is not eating and drinking, but  righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_18" data-id="RM14_18">for he who in these things is serving the Christ, [is]  acceptable to God and approved of men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_19" data-id="RM14_19">So, then, the things of peace may we pursue, and the  things of building up one another;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_20" data-id="RM14_20">for the sake of victuals cast not down the work of God;  all things, indeed, [are] pure, but evil [is] to the man who  is eating through stumbling.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_21" data-id="RM14_21">Right [it is] not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to  [do anything] in which thy brother doth stumble, or is made to  fall, or is weak.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_22" data-id="RM14_22">Thou hast faith! to thyself have [it] before God; happy is  he who is not judging himself in what he doth approve,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_23" data-id="RM14_23">and he who is making a difference, if he may eat, hath  been condemned, because [it is] not of faith; and all that  [is] not of faith is sin.</span>
