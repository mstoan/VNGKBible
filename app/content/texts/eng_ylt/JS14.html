<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS14_2" data-id="JS14_2">by lot [is] their inheritance, as Jehovah commanded by the  hand of Moses, for the nine of the tribes, and the half of the  tribe;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS14_3" data-id="JS14_3">for Moses hath given the inheritance of two of the tribes,  and of half of the tribe, beyond the Jordan, and to the Levites  he hath not given an inheritance in their midst;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS14_4" data-id="JS14_4">for the sons of Joseph hath been two tribes, Manasseh and  Ephraim, and they have not given a portion to the Levites in  the land, except cities to dwell in, and their suburbs for  their cattle, and for their possessions;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS14_5" data-id="JS14_5">as Jehovah commanded Moses, so have the sons of Israel  done, and they apportion the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS14_6" data-id="JS14_6">And the sons of Judah come nigh unto Joshua in Gilgal, and  Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenezzite saith unto him, `Thou hast  known the word that Jehovah hath spoken unto Moses the man of  God, concerning me and concerning thee in Kadesh-Barnea:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS14_7" data-id="JS14_7">a son of forty years [am] I in Moses, servant of Jehovah,  sending me from Kadesh-Barnea, to spy the land, and I bring him  back word as with my heart;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS14_8" data-id="JS14_8">and my brethren who have gone up with me have caused the  heart of the people to melt, and I have been fully after  Jehovah my God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS14_9" data-id="JS14_9">and Moses sweareth in that day, saying, If not -- the land  on which thy foot hath trodden, to thee it is for inheritance,  and to thy sons -- to the age, for thou hast been fully after  Jehovah my God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS14_10" data-id="JS14_10">`And, now, lo, Jehovah hath kept me alive, as He hath  spoken, these forty and five years, since Jehovah spake this  word unto Moses, when Israel went in the wilderness; and now,  lo, I [am] to-day a son of five and eighty years;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS14_11" data-id="JS14_11">yet [am] I to-day strong as in the day of Moses' sending  me; as my power then, so [is] my power now, for battle, and to  go out, and to come in.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS14_12" data-id="JS14_12">`And now, give to me this hill-country, of which Jehovah  spake in that day, for thou didst hear in that day, for Anakim  [are] there, and cities, great, fenced; if so be Jehovah [is]  with me, then I have dispossessed them, as Jehovah hath  spoken.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS14_13" data-id="JS14_13">And Joshua blesseth him, and giveth Hebron to Caleb son of  Jephunneh for an inheritance,</span>
