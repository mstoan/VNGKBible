<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK28_3" data-id="EK28_3">Lo, thou [art] wiser than Daniel, No hidden thing have they  concealed from thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK28_4" data-id="EK28_4">By thy wisdom and by thine understanding Thou hast made for  thee wealth, And makest gold and silver in thy treasuries.</span>

<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK28_25" data-id="EK28_25">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In My gathering the house of  Israel, Out of the peoples among whom they were scattered, I  have been sanctified in them, Before the eyes of the nations,  And they have dwelt on their ground, That I gave to My servant,  to Jacob,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK28_26" data-id="EK28_26">And they have dwelt on it confidently, And builded houses,  and planted vineyards, And dwelt confidently -- in My doing  judgments, On all those despising them round about, And they  have known that I, Jehovah, [am] their God!'</span>
