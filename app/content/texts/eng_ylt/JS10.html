<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_2" data-id="JS10_2">that they are greatly afraid, because Gibeon [is] a great  city, as one of the royal cities, and because it [is] greater  than Ai, and all its men -- heroes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_3" data-id="JS10_3">And Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sendeth unto Hoham king  of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king  of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_4" data-id="JS10_4">`Come up unto me, and help me, and we smite Gibeon, for it  hath made peace with Joshua, and with the sons of Israel.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_5" data-id="JS10_5">And five kings of the Amorite (the king of Jerusalem, the  king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the  king of Eglon) are gathered together, and go up, they and all  their camps, and encamp against Gibeon, and fight against it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_6" data-id="JS10_6">And the men of Gibeon send unto Joshua, unto the camp at  Gilgal, saying, `Let not thy hand cease from thy servants; come  up unto us [with] haste, and give safety to us, and help us;  for all the kings of the Amorite, dwelling in the hill-country,  have been assembled against us.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_7" data-id="JS10_7">And Joshua goeth up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of  war with him, even all the mighty men of valour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_8" data-id="JS10_8">And Jehovah saith unto Joshua, `Be not afraid of them, for  into thy hand I have given them, there doth not stand a man of  them in thy presence.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_9" data-id="JS10_9">And Joshua cometh in unto them suddenly (all the night he  hath gone up from Gilgal),</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_10" data-id="JS10_10">and Jehovah doth crush them before Israel, and it smiteth  them -- a great smiting -- at Gibeon, and pursueth them the way  of the ascent of Beth-Horon, and smiteth them unto Azekah, and  unto Makkedah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_11" data-id="JS10_11">And it cometh to pass, in their fleeing from the face of  Israel -- they [are] in the descent of Beth-Horon -- and  Jehovah hath cast upon them great stones out of the heavens,  unto Azekah, and they die; more are they who have died by the  hailstones than they whom the sons of Israel have slain by the  sword.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_12" data-id="JS10_12">Then speaketh Joshua to Jehovah in the day of Jehovah's  giving up the Amorites before the sons of Israel, and he saith,  before the eyes of Israel, `Sun -- in Gibeon stand still; and  moon -- in the valley of Ajalon;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_13" data-id="JS10_13">and the sun standeth still, and the moon hath stood -- till  the nation taketh vengeance [on] its enemies; is it not written  on the Book of the Upright, `and the sun standeth in the midst  of the heavens, and hath not hasted to go in -- as a perfect  day?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_14" data-id="JS10_14">And there hath not been like that day before it or after  it, for Jehovah's hearkening to the voice of a man; for Jehovah  is fighting for Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_15" data-id="JS10_15">And Joshua turneth back, and all Israel with him, unto the  camp at Gilgal.</span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_18" data-id="JS10_18">And Joshua saith, `Roll great stones unto the mouth of the  cave, and appoint over it men to watch them;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_19" data-id="JS10_19">and ye, stand not, pursue after your enemies, and ye have  smitten the hindmost of them; suffer them not to go in unto  their cities, for Jehovah your God hath given them into your  hand.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_20" data-id="JS10_20">And it cometh to pass, when Joshua and the sons of Israel  finish to smite them -- a very great smiting, till they are  consumed, and the remnant who have remained of them go in unto  the fenced cities,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_21" data-id="JS10_21">that all the people turn back to the camp, unto Joshua,  [at] Makkedah, in peace; none moved sharply his tongue against  the sons of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_22" data-id="JS10_22">And Joshua saith, `Open ye the mouth of the cave, and  bring out unto me these five kings from the cave;'</span>

<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_24" data-id="JS10_24">And it cometh to pass, when they bring out these kings  unto Joshua, that Joshua calleth unto every man of Israel, and  saith unto the captains of the men of war, who have gone with  him, `Draw near, set your feet on the necks of these kings;'  and they draw near, and set their feet on their necks.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_25" data-id="JS10_25">And Joshua saith unto them, `Fear not, nor be affrighted;  be strong and courageous; for thus doth Jehovah do to all your  enemies with whom ye are fighting;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_26" data-id="JS10_26">and Joshua smiteth them afterwards, and putteth them to  death, and hangeth them on five trees; and they are hanging on  the trees till the evening.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_27" data-id="JS10_27">And it cometh to pass, at the time of the going in of the  sun, Joshua hath commanded, and they take them down from off  the trees, and cast them unto the cave where they had been hid,  and put great stones on the mouth of the cave till this very  day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_28" data-id="JS10_28">And Makkedah hath Joshua captured on that day, and he  smiteth it by the mouth of the sword, and its king he hath  devoted, them and every person who [is] in it -- he hath not  left a remnant; and he doth to the king of Makkedah as he did  to the king of Jericho.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_29" data-id="JS10_29">And Joshua passeth over, and all Israel with him, from  Makkedah [to] Libnah, and fighteth with Libnah;</span>

<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_31" data-id="JS10_31">And Joshua passeth over, and all Israel with him, from  Libnah to Lachish, and encampeth against it, and fighteth  against it;</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_32" data-id="JS10_32">And Jehovah giveth Lachish into the hand of Israel, and it  captureth it on the second day, and smiteth it by the mouth of  the sword, and every person who [is] in it, according to all  that it did to Libnah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS10_33" data-id="JS10_33">Than hath Horam king of Gezer come up to help Lachish, and  Joshua smiteth him and his people, till he hath not left to him a  remnant.</span>
