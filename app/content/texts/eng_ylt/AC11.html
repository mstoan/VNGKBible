<div class="c">11</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_1" data-id="AC11_1">And the apostles and the brethren who are in Judea heard  that also the nations did receive the word of God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_2" data-id="AC11_2">and when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those of the  circumcision were contending with him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_3" data-id="AC11_3">saying -- `Unto men uncircumcised thou didst go in, and  didst eat with them!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_4" data-id="AC11_4">And Peter having begun, did expound to them in order  saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_5" data-id="AC11_5">`I was in the city of Joppa praying, and I saw in a trance  a vision, a certain vessel coming down, as a great sheet by  four corners being let down out of the heaven, and it came unto  me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_6" data-id="AC11_6">at which having looked stedfastly, I was considering, and I  saw the four-footed beasts of the earth, and the wild beasts,  and the creeping things, and the fowls of heaven;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_7" data-id="AC11_7">and I heard a voice saying to me, Having risen, Peter, slay  and eat;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_8" data-id="AC11_8">and I said, Not so, Lord; because anything common or  unclean hath at no time entered into my mouth;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_9" data-id="AC11_9">and a voice did answer me a second time out of the heaven,  What God did cleanse, thou -- declare not thou common.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_10" data-id="AC11_10">`And this happened thrice, and again was all drawn up to  the heaven,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_11" data-id="AC11_11">and, lo, immediately, three men stood at the house in  which I was, having been sent from Cesarea unto me,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_12" data-id="AC11_12">and the Spirit said to me to go with them, nothing  doubting, and these six brethren also went with me, and we did  enter into the house of the man,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_13" data-id="AC11_13">he declared also to us how he saw the messenger in his  house standing, and saying to him, Send men to Joppa, and call  for Simon, who is surnamed Peter,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_14" data-id="AC11_14">who shall speak sayings by which thou shalt be saved, thou  and all thy house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_15" data-id="AC11_15">`And in my beginning to speak, the Holy Spirit did fall  upon them, even as also upon us in the beginning,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_16" data-id="AC11_16">and I remembered the saying of the Lord, how he said, John  indeed did baptize with water, and ye shall be baptized with  the Holy Spirit;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_17" data-id="AC11_17">if then the equal gift God did give to them as also to us,  having believed upon the Lord Jesus Christ, I -- how was I able  to withstand God?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_18" data-id="AC11_18">And they, having heard these things, were silent, and were  glorifying God, saying, `Then, indeed, also to the nations did  God give the reformation to life.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_19" data-id="AC11_19">Those, indeed, therefore, having been scattered abroad,  from the tribulation that came after Stephen, went through unto  Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none  except to Jews only;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_20" data-id="AC11_20">and there were certain of them men of Cyprus and Cyrene,  who having entered into Antioch, were speaking unto the  Hellenists, proclaiming good news -- the Lord Jesus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_21" data-id="AC11_21">and the hand of the Lord was with them, a great number  also, having believed, did turn unto the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_22" data-id="AC11_22">And the account was heard in the ears of the assembly that  [is] in Jerusalem concerning them, and they sent forth Barnabas  to go through unto Antioch,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_23" data-id="AC11_23">who, having come, and having seen the grace of God, was  glad, and was exhorting all with purpose of heart to cleave to  the Lord,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_24" data-id="AC11_24">because he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit,  and of faith, and a great multitude was added to the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_25" data-id="AC11_25">And Barnabas went forth to Tarsus, to seek for Saul,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_26" data-id="AC11_26">and having found him, he brought him to Antioch, and it  came to pass that they a whole year did assemble together in  the assembly, and taught a great multitude, the disciples also  were divinely called first in Antioch Christians.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_27" data-id="AC11_27">And in those days there came from Jerusalem prophets to  Antioch,</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_28" data-id="AC11_28">and one of them, by name Agabus, having stood up, did  signify through the Spirit a great dearth is about to be  throughout all the world -- which also came to pass in the time  of Claudius Caesar --</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_29" data-id="AC11_29">and the disciples, according as any one was prospering,  determined each of them to send for ministration to the  brethren dwelling in Judea,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_30" data-id="AC11_30">which also they did, having sent unto the elders by the  hand of Barnabas and Saul.</span>
