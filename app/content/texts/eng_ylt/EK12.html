<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK12_3" data-id="EK12_3">And thou, son of man, make to thee vessels of removal, and  remove by day before their eyes, and thou hast removed from thy  place unto another place before their eyes, it may be they  consider, for a rebellious house they [are].</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK12_4" data-id="EK12_4">And thou hast brought forth thy vessels as vessels of  removal by day before their eyes, and thou, thou dost go forth  at even before their eyes, as the goings forth of a removal.</span>

<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK12_20" data-id="EK12_20">And the cities that are inhabited are laid waste, and the  land is a desolation, and ye have known that I [am] Jehovah.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK12_23" data-id="EK12_23">therefore say unto them: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: I  have caused this simile to cease, And they use it not as a  simile again in Israel, But speak to them: Drawn near have the  days, And spoken hath every vision.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK12_24" data-id="EK12_24">For there is no more any vain vision, and flattering  divination, In the midst of the house of Israel.</span>

<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK12_26" data-id="EK12_26">And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying:</span>
