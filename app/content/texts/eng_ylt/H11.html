<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v H11_4" data-id="H11_4">having known, brethren beloved, by God, your election,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v H11_5" data-id="H11_5">because our good news did not come to you in word only, but  also in power,  and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance,  even as ye have known of what  sort we became among you because  of you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v H11_6" data-id="H11_6">and ye -- ye did become imitators of us, and of the Lord,  having received  the word in much tribulation, with joy of the  Holy Spirit,</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v H11_9" data-id="H11_9">for they themselves concerning us do declare what entrance  we had unto you,  and how ye did turn unto God from the idols,  to serve a living and true God,</span>
