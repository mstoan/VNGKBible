<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_2" data-id="AC7_2">and he said, `Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken: The God  of the glory did appear to our father Abraham, being in  Mesopotamia, before his dwelling in Haran,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_3" data-id="AC7_3">and He said to him, Go forth out of thy land, and out of thy  kindred, and come to a land that I shall shew thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_4" data-id="AC7_4">`Then having come forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, he  dwelt in Haran, and from thence, after the death of his  father, He did remove him to this land wherein ye now dwell,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_5" data-id="AC7_5">and He gave him no inheritance in it, not even a footstep,  and did promise to give it to him for a possession, and to his  seed after him -- he having no child.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_6" data-id="AC7_6">`And God spake thus, That his seed shall be sojourning in a  strange land, and they shall cause it to serve, and shall do  it evil four hundred years,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_7" data-id="AC7_7">and the nation whom they shall serve I will judge, said God;  and after these things they shall come forth and shall do Me  service in this place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_8" data-id="AC7_8">`And He gave to him a covenant of circumcision, and so he  begat Isaac, and did circumcise him on the eighth day, and  Isaac [begat] Jacob, and Jacob -- the twelve patriarchs;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_9" data-id="AC7_9">and the patriarchs, having been moved with jealousy, sold  Joseph to Egypt, and God was with him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_10" data-id="AC7_10">and did deliver him out of all his tribulations, and gave  him favour and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he did  set him -- governor over Egypt and all his house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_11" data-id="AC7_11">`And there came a dearth upon all the land of Egypt and  Canaan, and great tribulation, and our fathers were not  finding sustenance,</span>

<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_25" data-id="AC7_25">and he was supposing his brethren to understand that God  through his hand doth give salvation; and they did not  understand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_26" data-id="AC7_26">`On the succeeding day, also, he shewed himself to them as  they are striving, and urged them to peace, saying, Men,  brethren are ye, wherefore do ye injustice to one another?</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_27" data-id="AC7_27">and he who is doing injustice to the neighbour, did thrust  him away, saying, Who set thee a ruler and a judge over us?</span>

<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_30" data-id="AC7_30">and forty years having been fulfilled, there appeared to  him in the wilderness of mount Sinai a messenger of the Lord,  in a flame of fire of a bush,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_31" data-id="AC7_31">and Moses having seen did wonder at the sight; and he  drawing near to behold, there came a voice of the Lord unto  him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_32" data-id="AC7_32">I [am] the God of thy fathers; the God of Abraham, and the  God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. `And Moses having become  terrified, durst not behold,</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_33" data-id="AC7_33">and the Lord said to him, Loose the sandal of thy feet, for  the place in which thou hast stood is holy ground;</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_34" data-id="AC7_34">seeing I have seen the affliction of My people that [is] in  Egypt, and their groaning I did hear, and came down to deliver  them; and now come, I will send thee to Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_35" data-id="AC7_35">`This Moses, whom they did refuse, saying, Who did set thee  a ruler and a judge? this one God a ruler and a redeemer did  send, in the hand of a messenger who appeared to him in the  bush;</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_36" data-id="AC7_36">this one did bring them forth, having done wonders and  signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the  wilderness forty years;</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_37" data-id="AC7_37">this is the Moses who did say to the sons of Israel: A  prophet to you shall the Lord your God raise up out of your  brethren, like to me, him shall ye hear.</span>

<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_39" data-id="AC7_39">to whom our fathers did not wish to become obedient, but  did thrust away, and turned back in their hearts to Egypt,</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_40" data-id="AC7_40">saying to Aaron, Make to us gods who shall go on before us,  for this Moses, who brought us forth out of the land of Egypt,  we have not known what hath happened to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_41" data-id="AC7_41">`And they made a calf in those days, and brought a  sacrifice to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of  their hands,</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_42" data-id="AC7_42">and God did turn, and did give them up to do service to the  host of the heaven, according as it hath been written in the  scroll of the prophets: Slain beasts and sacrifices did ye  offer to Me forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_43" data-id="AC7_43">and ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of  your god Remphan -- the figures that ye made to bow before  them, and I will remove your dwelling beyond Babylon.</span>
