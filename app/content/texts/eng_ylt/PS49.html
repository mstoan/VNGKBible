<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS49_2" data-id="PS49_2">Both low and high, together rich and needy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS49_3" data-id="PS49_3">My mouth speaketh wise things, And the meditations of my  heart [are] things of understanding.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS49_4" data-id="PS49_4">I incline to a simile mine ear, I open with a harp my  riddle:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS49_5" data-id="PS49_5">Why do I fear in days of evil? The iniquity of my  supplanters doth compass me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS49_6" data-id="PS49_6">Those trusting on their wealth, And in the multitude of  their riches, Do shew themselves foolish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS49_7" data-id="PS49_7">A brother doth no one at all ransom, He doth not give to  God his atonement.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS49_11" data-id="PS49_11">Their heart [is]: Their houses [are] to the age, Their  tabernacles to all generations. They proclaimed their names  over the lands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS49_12" data-id="PS49_12">And man in honour doth not remain, He hath been like the  beasts, they have been cut off.</span>
