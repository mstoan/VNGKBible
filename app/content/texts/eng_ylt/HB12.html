<div class="c">12</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_1" data-id="HB12_1">Therefore, we also having so great a cloud of witnesses set  around us, every weight having put off, and the closely  besetting sin, through endurance may we run the contest that  is set before us,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_2" data-id="HB12_2">looking to the author and perfecter of faith -- Jesus, who,  over-against the joy set before him -- did endure a cross,  shame having despised, on the right hand also of the throne of  God did sit down;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_3" data-id="HB12_3">for consider again him who endured such gainsaying from the  sinners to himself, that ye may not be wearied in your souls  -- being faint.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_4" data-id="HB12_4">Not yet unto blood did ye resist -- with the sin striving;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_5" data-id="HB12_5">and ye have forgotten the exhortation that doth speak fully  with you as with sons, `My son, be not despising chastening of  the Lord, nor be faint, being reproved by Him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_6" data-id="HB12_6">for whom the Lord doth love He doth chasten, and He  scourgeth every son whom He receiveth;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_7" data-id="HB12_7">if chastening ye endure, as to sons God beareth Himself to  you, for who is a son whom a father doth not chasten?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_8" data-id="HB12_8">and if ye are apart from chastening, of which all have  become partakers, then bastards are ye, and not sons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_9" data-id="HB12_9">Then, indeed, fathers of our flesh we have had, chastising  [us], and we were reverencing [them]; shall we not much rather  be subject to the Father of the spirits, and live?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_10" data-id="HB12_10">for they, indeed, for a few days, according to what seemed  good to them, were chastening, but He for profit, to be  partakers of His separation;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_11" data-id="HB12_11">and all chastening for the present, indeed, doth not seem  to be of joy, but of sorrow, yet afterward the peaceable fruit  of righteousness to those exercised through it -- it doth  yield.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_12" data-id="HB12_12">Wherefore, the hanging-down hands and the loosened knees  set ye up;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_13" data-id="HB12_13">and straight paths make for your feet, that that which is  lame may not be turned aside, but rather be healed;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_14" data-id="HB12_14">peace pursue with all, and the separation, apart from  which no one shall see the Lord,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_15" data-id="HB12_15">looking diligently over lest any one be failing of the  grace of God, lest any root of bitterness springing up may  give trouble, and through this many may be defiled;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_16" data-id="HB12_16">lest any one be a fornicator, or a profane person, as  Esau, who in exchange for one morsel of food did sell his  birthright,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_17" data-id="HB12_17">for ye know that also afterwards, wishing to inherit the  blessing, he was disapproved of, for a place of reformation he  found not, though with tears having sought it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_18" data-id="HB12_18">For ye came not near to the mount touched and scorched  with fire, and to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_19" data-id="HB12_19">and a sound of a trumpet, and a voice of sayings, which  those having heard did entreat that a word might not be added  to them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_20" data-id="HB12_20">for they were not bearing that which is commanded, `And if  a beast may touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or with an  arrow shot through,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_21" data-id="HB12_21">and, (so terrible was the sight,) Moses said, `I am  fearful exceedingly, and trembling.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_22" data-id="HB12_22">But, ye came to Mount Zion, and to a city of the living  God, to the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of messengers,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_23" data-id="HB12_23">to the company and assembly of the first-born in heaven  enrolled, and to God the judge of all, and to spirits of  righteous men made perfect,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_24" data-id="HB12_24">and to a mediator of a new covenant -- Jesus, and to blood  of sprinkling, speaking better things than that of Abel!</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_25" data-id="HB12_25">See, may ye not refuse him who is speaking, for if those  did not escape who refused him who upon earth was divinely  speaking -- much less we who do turn away from him who  [speaketh] from heaven,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_26" data-id="HB12_26">whose voice the earth shook then, and now hath he  promised, saying, `Yet once -- I shake not only the earth, but  also the heaven;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_27" data-id="HB12_27">and this -- `Yet once' -- doth make evident the removal of  the things shaken, as of things having been made, that the  things not shaken may remain;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_28" data-id="HB12_28">wherefore, a kingdom that cannot be shaken receiving, may  we have grace, through which we may serve God well-pleasingly,  with reverence and religious fear;</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_29" data-id="HB12_29">for also our God [is] a consuming fire.</span>
