<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_2" data-id="IS44_2">Thus said Jehovah, thy Maker, and thy Former, From the womb  He doth help thee; Fear not, my servant Jacob, And Jeshurun,  whom I have fixed on.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_3" data-id="IS44_3">For I pour waters on a thirsty one, And floods on a dry  land, I pour My Spirit on thy seed, And My blessing on thine  offspring.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_4" data-id="IS44_4">And they have sprung up as among grass, As willows by  streams of water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_5" data-id="IS44_5">This [one] saith, For Jehovah I [am], And this calleth  [himself] by the name of Jacob, And this [one] writeth [with]  his hand, `For Jehovah,' and by the name of Israel surnameth  himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_6" data-id="IS44_6">Thus said Jehovah, king of Israel, And his Redeemer,  Jehovah of Hosts: `I [am] the first, and I the last, And  besides Me there is no God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_7" data-id="IS44_7">And who as I, doth call and declare it, And arrange it for  Me, Since My placing the people of antiquity, And things that  are coming, And those that do come, declare they to them?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_8" data-id="IS44_8">Fear not, nor be afraid, Have I not from that time caused  thee to hear, and declared? And ye [are] My witnesses, Is there  a God besides Me? yea, there is none, A Rock I have not known.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_9" data-id="IS44_9">Framers of a graven image [are] all of them emptiness, And  their desirable things do not profit, And their own witnesses  they [are], They see not, nor know, that they may be ashamed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_10" data-id="IS44_10">Who hath formed a god, And a molten image poured out --  not profitable?</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_11" data-id="IS44_11">Lo, all his companions are ashamed, As to artizans -- they  [are] of men, All of them gather together, they stand up, They  fear, they are ashamed together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_12" data-id="IS44_12">He hath wrought iron [with] an axe, And hath wrought with  coals, And with hammers doth form it, And doth work it by his  powerful arm, Yea, he is hungry, and there is no power, He doth  not drink water, and he is wearied.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_13" data-id="IS44_13">He hath wrought [with] wood, He hath stretched out a rule,  He doth mark it out with a line, He maketh it with carving  tools, And with a compass he marketh it out, And maketh it  according to the form of a man, According to the beauty of a  man, To remain in the house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_14" data-id="IS44_14">Cutting down to himself cedars, He taketh also a cypress,  and an oak, And he strengtheneth [it] for himself Among the  trees of a forest, He hath planted an ash, and the shower doth  nourish [it].</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_15" data-id="IS44_15">And it hath been for man to burn, And he taketh of them,  and becometh warm, Yea, he kindleth [it], and hath baked bread,  Yea, he maketh a god, and boweth himself, He hath made it a  graven image, And he falleth down to it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_16" data-id="IS44_16">Half of it he hath burnt in the fire, By [this] half of it  he eateth flesh, He roasteth a roasting, and is satisfied, Yea,  he is warm, and saith: `Aha, I have become warm, I have enjoyed  the light.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_17" data-id="IS44_17">And its remnant for a god he hath made -- For his graven  image, He falleth down to it, and worshippeth, And prayeth unto  it, and he saith, `Deliver me, for my god thou [art].'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_18" data-id="IS44_18">They have not known, nor do they understand, For He hath  daubed their eyes from seeing, Their heart from acting wisely.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_19" data-id="IS44_19">And none doth turn [it] back unto his heart, Nor hath  knowledge nor understanding to say, `Half of it I have burned  in the fire, Yea, also, I have baked bread over its coals, I  roast flesh and I eat, And its remnant for an abomination I  make, To the stock of a tree I fall down.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_20" data-id="IS44_20">Feeding on ashes, the heart is deceived, It hath turned  him aside, And he delivereth not his soul, nor saith: `Is there  not a lie in my right hand?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_21" data-id="IS44_21">Remember these, O Jacob, and Israel, For My servant thou  [art], I formed thee, a servant to Me thou [art], O Israel,  thou dost not forget Me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_22" data-id="IS44_22">I have blotted out, as [by] a thick cloud, Thy  transgressions, And as [by] a cloud thy sins, Return unto Me,  for I have redeemed thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_23" data-id="IS44_23">Sing, O heavens, for Jehovah hath wrought, Shout, O lower  parts of earth, Break forth, O mountains, with singing, Forest,  and every tree in it, For Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob, And in  Israel He doth beautify Himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_24" data-id="IS44_24">Thus said Jehovah, thy redeemer, And thy framer from the  womb: `I [am] Jehovah, doing all things, Stretching out the  heavens by Myself, Spreading out the earth -- who [is] with Me?</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_25" data-id="IS44_25">Making void the tokens of devisers, And diviners it maketh  mad, Turning the wise backward, And their knowledge it maketh  foolish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_26" data-id="IS44_26">Confirming the word of His servant, The counsel of His  messengers it perfecteth, Who is saying of Jerusalem, She is  inhabited, And of cities of Judah, They shall be built, and her  wastes I raise up,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_27" data-id="IS44_27">Who is saying to the deep, Be dry, and thy rivers I cause  to dry up,</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_28" data-id="IS44_28">Who is saying of Cyrus, My shepherd, And all my delight He  doth perfect, So as to say of Jerusalem, Thou art built, And of  the temple, Thou art founded.</span>
