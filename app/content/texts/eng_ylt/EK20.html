<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK20_38" data-id="EK20_38">And cleared out from you the rebels, And them  transgressing against Me, From the land of their sojournings I  bring them out, And unto the land of Israel they come not, And  ye have known that I [am] Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK20_39" data-id="EK20_39">And ye, O house of Israel, thus said the Lord Jehovah:  Each his idols -- go -- serve ye, And, afterwards, if ye are  not hearkening to me, And My holy name ye do not pollute any  more by your gifts, and by your idols.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK20_40" data-id="EK20_40">For, in My holy mountain, In the mountain of the height of  Israel, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah, There serve Me do  all the house of Israel, All of it, in the land -- there I  accept them, And there I do seek your heave-offerings, And with  the first-fruit of your gifts, With all your holy things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK20_41" data-id="EK20_41">With sweet fragrance I do accept you, In My bringing you  out from the peoples, And I have assembled you from the lands  In which ye have been scattered, And I have been sanctified in  you Before the eyes of the nations.</span>

<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK20_43" data-id="EK20_43">And ye have remembered there your ways, And all your  doings, In which ye have been defiled, And ye have been  loathsome in your own faces, For all your evils that ye have  done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK20_44" data-id="EK20_44">And ye have known that I [am] Jehovah, In My dealing with  you for My name's sake, Not according to your evil ways, And  according to your corrupt doings, O house of Israel, An  affirmation of the Lord Jehovah.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK20_45" data-id="EK20_45">And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying,</span>
