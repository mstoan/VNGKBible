<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_2" data-id="T22_2">and the things that thou didst hear from me through many  witnesses, these things be committing to stedfast men, who  shall be sufficient also others to teach;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_3" data-id="T22_3">thou, therefore, suffer evil as a good soldier of Jesus  Christ;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_4" data-id="T22_4">no one serving as a soldier did entangle himself with the  affairs of life, that him who did enlist him he may please;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_5" data-id="T22_5">and if also any one may strive, he is not crowned, except he  may strive lawfully;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_6" data-id="T22_6">the labouring husbandman it behoveth first of the fruits to  partake;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_7" data-id="T22_7">be considering what things I say, for the Lord give to thee  understanding in all things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_8" data-id="T22_8">Remember Jesus Christ, raised out of the dead, of the seed  of David, according to my good news,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_9" data-id="T22_9">in which I suffer evil -- unto bonds, as an evil-doer, but  the word of God hath not been bound;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_10" data-id="T22_10">because of this all things do I endure, because of the  choice ones, that they also salvation may obtain that [is] in  Christ Jesus, with glory age-during.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_11" data-id="T22_11">Stedfast [is] the word: For if we died together -- we also  shall live together;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_12" data-id="T22_12">if we do endure together -- we shall also reign together;  if we deny [him], he also shall deny us;</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_15" data-id="T22_15">be diligent to present thyself approved to God -- a workman  irreproachable, rightly dividing the word of the truth;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_16" data-id="T22_16">and the profane vain talkings stand aloof from, for to more  impiety they will advance,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_17" data-id="T22_17">and their word as a gangrene will have pasture, of whom is  Hymenaeus and Philetus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_18" data-id="T22_18">who concerning the truth did swerve, saying the rising  again to have already been, and do overthrow the faith of  some;</span>

<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_20" data-id="T22_20">And in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and  of silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some to honour,  and some to dishonour:</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_21" data-id="T22_21">if, then, any one may cleanse himself from these, he shall  be a vessel to honour, sanctified and profitable to the master  -- to every good work having been prepared,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_22" data-id="T22_22">and the youthful lusts flee thou, and pursue righteousness,  faith, love, peace, with those calling upon the Lord out of a  pure heart;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_23" data-id="T22_23">and the foolish and uninstructed questions be avoiding,  having known that they beget strife,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_24" data-id="T22_24">and a servant of the Lord it behoveth not to strive, but to  be gentle unto all, apt to teach, patient under evil,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_25" data-id="T22_25">in meekness instructing those opposing -- if perhaps God  may give to them repentance to an acknowledging of the truth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_26" data-id="T22_26">and they may awake out of the devil's snare, having been  caught by him at his will.</span>
