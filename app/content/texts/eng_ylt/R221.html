<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R221_2" data-id="R221_2">And he hath brethren, sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and  Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and  Shephatiah; all these [are] sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R221_3" data-id="R221_3">and their father giveth to them many gifts of silver and of  gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah, and  the kingdom he hath given to Jehoram, for He [is] the  first-born.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R221_4" data-id="R221_4">And Jehoram riseth up over the kingdom of his father, and  strengtheneth himself, and slayeth all his brethren with the  sword, and also -- of the heads of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R221_5" data-id="R221_5">A son of thirty and two years [is] Jehoram in his reigning,  and eight years he hath reigned in Jerusalem,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R221_6" data-id="R221_6">and he walketh in the way of the kings of Israel, as did  the house of Ahab, for a daughter of Ahab hath been to him for  a wife, and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R221_7" data-id="R221_7">and Jehovah hath not been willing to destroy the house of  David, for the sake of the covenant that He made with David,  and as He had said to give to him a lamp, and to his sons --  all the days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R221_8" data-id="R221_8">In his days hath Edom revolted from under the hand of  Judah, and cause a king to reign over them;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v R221_9" data-id="R221_9">and Jehoram passeth over with his heads, and all the  chariots with him, and it cometh to pass, he hath risen by  night and smiteth the Edomites who are coming round against  him, and the princes of the chariots,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v R221_10" data-id="R221_10">and Edom revolteth from under the hand of Judah unto this  day; then doth Libnah revolt at that time from under his hand,  because he hath forsaken Jehovah, God of his fathers,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v R221_11" data-id="R221_11">also, he hath made high places in the mountains of Judah,  and causeth the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit whoredom,  and compelleth Judah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v R221_12" data-id="R221_12">And there cometh in unto him a writing from Elijah the  prophet, saying, `Thus said Jehovah, God of David thy father,  Because that thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat  thy father, and in the ways of Asa king of Judah,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v R221_13" data-id="R221_13">and thou dost walk in the way of the kings of Israel, and  dost cause Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit  whoredom like the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also thy  brethren, the house of thy father, who are better than thyself,  thou hast slain;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v R221_14" data-id="R221_14">lo, Jehovah is smiting -- a great smiting -- among thy  people, and among thy sons, and among thy wives, and among all  thy goods --</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v R221_15" data-id="R221_15">and thou, with many sicknesses, with disease of thy  bowels, till thy bowels come out, by the sickness, day by day.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v R221_16" data-id="R221_16">And Jehovah waketh up against Jehoram the spirit of the  Philistines, and of the Arabians, who [are] beside the Cushim,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v R221_17" data-id="R221_17">and they come up into Judah, and rend it, and take captive  all the substance that is found at the house of the king, and  also his sons, and his wives, and there hath not been left to  him a son except Jehoahaz the youngest of his sons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v R221_18" data-id="R221_18">And after all this hath Jehovah plagued him in his bowels  by a disease for which there is no healing,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v R221_19" data-id="R221_19">and it cometh to pass, from days to days, and at the time  of the going out of the end of two years, his bowels have gone  out with his sickness, and he dieth of sore diseases, and his  people have not made for him a burning like the burning of his  fathers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v R221_20" data-id="R221_20">A son of thirty and two [years] was he in his reigning,  and eight years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and he goeth  without desire, and they bury him in the city of David, and not  in the graves of the kings.</span>
