<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_2" data-id="AC1_2">till the day in which, having given command, through the  Holy Spirit, to the apostles whom he did choose out, he was  taken up,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_3" data-id="AC1_3">to whom also he did present himself alive after his  suffering, in many certain proofs, through forty days being  seen by them, and speaking the things concerning the reign of  God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_4" data-id="AC1_4">And being assembled together with them, he commanded them  not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of  the Father, which, [saith he,] `Ye did hear of me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_5" data-id="AC1_5">because John, indeed, baptized with water, and ye shall be  baptized with the Holy Spirit -- after not many days.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_6" data-id="AC1_6">They, therefore, indeed, having come together, were  questioning him, saying, `Lord, dost thou at this time restore  the reign to Israel?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_7" data-id="AC1_7">and he said unto them, `It is not yours to know times or  seasons that the Father did appoint in His own authority;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_8" data-id="AC1_8">but ye shall receive power at the coming of the Holy Spirit  upon you, and ye shall be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem,  and in all Judea, and Samaria, and unto the end of the earth.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_9" data-id="AC1_9">And these things having said -- they beholding -- he was  taken up, and a cloud did receive him up from their sight;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_10" data-id="AC1_10">and as they were looking stedfastly to the heaven in his  going on, then, lo, two men stood by them in white apparel,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_11" data-id="AC1_11">who also said, `Men, Galileans, why do ye stand gazing into  the heaven? this Jesus who was received up from you into the  heaven, shall so come in what manner ye saw him going on to  the heaven.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_12" data-id="AC1_12">Then did they return to Jerusalem from the mount that is  called of Olives, that is near Jerusalem, a sabbath's journey;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_13" data-id="AC1_13">and when they came in, they went up to the upper room,  where were abiding both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew,  Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James, of  Alphaeus, and Simon the Zelotes, and Judas, of James;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_14" data-id="AC1_14">these all were continuing with one accord in prayer and  supplication, with women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and  with his brethren.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_15" data-id="AC1_15">And in these days, Peter having risen up in the midst of  the disciples, said, (the multitude also of the names at the  same place was, as it were, an hundred and twenty,)</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_16" data-id="AC1_16">`Men, brethren, it behoved this Writing that it be  fulfilled that beforehand the Holy Spirit spake through the  mouth of David, concerning Judas, who became guide to those who  took Jesus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_17" data-id="AC1_17">because he was numbered among us, and did receive the share  in this ministration,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_18" data-id="AC1_18">this one, indeed, then, purchased a field out of the reward  of unrighteousness, and falling headlong, burst asunder in the  midst, and all his bowels gushed forth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_19" data-id="AC1_19">and it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem,  insomuch that that place is called, in their proper dialect,  Aceldama, that is, field of blood,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_20" data-id="AC1_20">for it hath been written in the book of Psalms: Let his  lodging-place become desolate, and let no one be dwelling in  it, and his oversight let another take.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_21" data-id="AC1_21">`It behoveth, therefore, of the men who did go with us  during all the time in which the Lord Jesus went in and went  out among us,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_22" data-id="AC1_22">beginning from the baptism of John, unto the day in which  he was received up from us, one of these to become with us a  witness of his rising again.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_23" data-id="AC1_23">And they set two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed  Justus, and Matthias,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_24" data-id="AC1_24">and having prayed, they said, `Thou, Lord, who art knowing  the heart of all, shew which one thou didst choose of these two</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_25" data-id="AC1_25">to receive the share of this ministration and apostleship,  from which Judas, by transgression, did fall, to go on to his  proper place;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC1_26" data-id="AC1_26">and they gave their lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias,  and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</span>
