<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_2" data-id="GN40_2">and Pharaoh is wroth against his two eunuchs, against the  chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_3" data-id="GN40_3">and giveth them in charge in the house of the chief of the  executioners, unto the round-house, the place where Joseph [is]  a prisoner,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_4" data-id="GN40_4">and the chief of the executioners chargeth Joseph with  them, and he serveth them; and they are days in charge.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_5" data-id="GN40_5">And they dream a dream both of them, each his dream in one  night, each according to the interpretation of his dream, the  butler and the baker whom the king of Egypt hath, who [are]  prisoners in the round-house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_6" data-id="GN40_6">And Joseph cometh in unto them in the morning, and seeth  them, and lo, they [are] morose;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_7" data-id="GN40_7">and he asketh Pharaoh's eunuchs who [are] with him in  charge in the house of his lord, saying, `Wherefore [are] your  faces sad to-day?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_8" data-id="GN40_8">And they say unto him, `A dream we have dreamed, and there  is no interpreter of it;' and Joseph saith unto them, `Are not  interpretations with God? recount, I pray you, to me.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN40_10" data-id="GN40_10">and in the vine [are] three branches, and it [is] as it  were flourishing; gone up hath its blossom, its clusters have  ripened grapes;</span>
