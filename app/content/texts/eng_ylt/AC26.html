<div class="c">26</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_1" data-id="AC26_1">And Agrippa said unto Paul, `It is permitted to thee to  speak for thyself;' then Paul having stretched forth the hand,  was making a defence:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_2" data-id="AC26_2">`Concerning all things of which I am accused by Jews, king  Agrippa, I have thought myself happy, being about to make a  defence before thee to-day,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_3" data-id="AC26_3">especially knowing thee to be acquainted with all things --  both customs and questions -- among Jews; wherefore, I beseech  thee, patiently to hear me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_4" data-id="AC26_4">`The manner of my life then, indeed, from youth -- which  from the beginning was among my nation, in Jerusalem -- know do  all the Jews,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_5" data-id="AC26_5">knowing me before from the first, (if they may be willing  to testify,) that after the most exact sect of our worship, I  lived a Pharisee;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_6" data-id="AC26_6">and now for the hope of the promise made to the fathers by  God, I have stood judged,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_7" data-id="AC26_7">to which our twelve tribes, intently night and day serving,  do hope to come, concerning which hope I am accused, king  Agrippa, by the Jews;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_8" data-id="AC26_8">why is it judged incredible with you, if God doth raise the  dead?</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_9" data-id="AC26_9">`I, indeed, therefore, thought with myself, that against  the name of Jesus of Nazareth it behoved [me] many things to  do,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_10" data-id="AC26_10">which also I did in Jerusalem, and many of the saints I in  prison did shut up, from the chief priests having received the  authority; they also being put to death, I gave my vote against  them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_11" data-id="AC26_11">and in every synagogue, often punishing them, I was  constraining [them] to speak evil, being also exceedingly mad  against them, I was also persecuting [them] even unto strange  cities.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_12" data-id="AC26_12">`In which things, also, going on to Damascus -- with  authority and commission from the chief priests --</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_13" data-id="AC26_13">at mid-day, I saw in the way, O king, out of heaven, above  the brightness of the sun, shining round about me a light --  and those going on with me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_14" data-id="AC26_14">and we all having fallen to the earth, I heard a voice  speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew dialect, Saul, Saul,  why me dost thou persecute? hard for thee against pricks to  kick!</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_15" data-id="AC26_15">`And I said, Who art thou, Lord? and he said, I am Jesus  whom thou dost persecute;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_16" data-id="AC26_16">but rise, and stand upon thy feet, for for this I appeared  to thee, to appoint thee an officer and a witness both of the  things thou didst see, and of the things [in which] I will  appear to thee,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_17" data-id="AC26_17">delivering thee from the people, and the nations, to whom  now I send thee,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_18" data-id="AC26_18">to open their eyes, to turn [them] from darkness to light,  and [from] the authority of the Adversary unto God, for their  receiving forgiveness of sins, and a lot among those having  been sanctified, by faith that [is] toward me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_19" data-id="AC26_19">`Whereupon, king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the  heavenly vision,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_20" data-id="AC26_20">but to those in Damascus first, and to those in Jerusalem,  to all the region also of Judea, and to the nations, I was  preaching to reform, and to turn back unto God, doing works  worthy of reformation;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_21" data-id="AC26_21">because of these things the Jews -- having caught me in  the temple -- were endeavouring to kill [me].</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_22" data-id="AC26_22">`Having obtained, therefore, help from God, till this day,  I have stood witnessing both to small and to great, saying  nothing besides the things that both the prophets and Moses  spake of as about to come,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_23" data-id="AC26_23">that the Christ is to suffer, whether first by a rising  from the dead, he is about to proclaim light to the people and  to the nations.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_24" data-id="AC26_24">And, he thus making a defence, Festus with a loud voice  said, `Thou art mad, Paul; much learning doth turn thee mad;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_25" data-id="AC26_25">and he saith, `I am not mad, most noble Festus, but of  truth and soberness the sayings I speak forth;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_26" data-id="AC26_26">for the king doth know concerning these things, before  whom also I speak boldly, for none of these things, I am  persuaded, are hidden from him; for this thing hath not been  done in a corner;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_27" data-id="AC26_27">thou dost believe, king Agrippa, the prophets? I have  known that thou dost believe!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_28" data-id="AC26_28">And Agrippa said unto Paul, `In a little thou dost  persuade me to become a Christian!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_29" data-id="AC26_29">and Paul said, `I would have wished to God, both in a  little, and in much, not only thee, but also all those hearing  me to-day, to become such as I also am -- except these bonds.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_30" data-id="AC26_30">And, he having spoken these things, the king rose up, and  the governor, Bernice also, and those sitting with them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_31" data-id="AC26_31">and having withdrawn, they were speaking unto one another,  saying -- `This man doth nothing worthy of death or of bonds;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC26_32" data-id="AC26_32">and Agrippa said to Festus, `This man might have been  released if he had not appealed to Caesar.'</span>
