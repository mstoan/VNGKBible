<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC10_2" data-id="ZC10_2">Because the teraphim did speak iniquity, And the diviners  have seen a falsehood, And dreams of the vanity they speak,  [With] vanity they give comfort, Therefore they have journeyed  as a flock, They are afflicted, for there is no shepherd.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC10_3" data-id="ZC10_3">Against the shepherds did Mine anger burn, And against the  he-goats I lay a charge, For inspected hath Jehovah of Hosts  His flock, the house of Judah, And set them as His beauteous  horse in battle.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC10_4" data-id="ZC10_4">From him [is] a corner-stone, From him a nail, from him a  battle-bow, From him goeth forth every exactor together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC10_5" data-id="ZC10_5">And they have been as heroes, Treading in mire of  out-places in battle, And they have fought, for Jehovah [is]  with them, And have put to shame riders of horses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC10_6" data-id="ZC10_6">And I have made mighty the house of Judah, And the house of  Joseph I do save, And I have caused them to dwell, for I have  loved them, And they have been as [if] I had not cast them off,  For I [am] Jehovah their God, And I answer them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC10_7" data-id="ZC10_7">And Ephraim hath been as a hero, And rejoiced hath their  heart as wine, And their sons see, and they have rejoiced,  Rejoice doth their heart in Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC10_8" data-id="ZC10_8">I hist for them, and I gather them, For I have redeemed  them, And they have multiplied as they did multiply.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC10_9" data-id="ZC10_9">And I sow them among peoples, And in far-off places they  remember Me, And they have lived with their sons, And they have  turned back.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC10_10" data-id="ZC10_10">And I have brought them back from the land of Egypt, And  from Asshur I do gather them, And unto the land of Gilead and  Lebanon I do bring them in, And there is not found for them  [space].</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC10_11" data-id="ZC10_11">And He hath passed over through the sea, And hath pressed  and smitten billows in the sea, And dried up have been all  depths of a flood, And brought down hath been the excellency of  Asshur, And the rod of Egypt doth turn aside.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC10_12" data-id="ZC10_12">And I have made them mighty in Jehovah, And in His name  they walk up and down, An affirmation of Jehovah!</span>
