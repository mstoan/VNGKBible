<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU20_2" data-id="NU20_2">And there hath been no water for the company, and they are  assembled against Moses, and against Aaron,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU20_3" data-id="NU20_3">and the people strive with Moses, and speak, saying, `And  oh that we had expired when our brethren expired before  Jehovah!</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU20_4" data-id="NU20_4">and why have ye brought in the assembly of Jehovah unto  this wilderness to die there, we and our beasts?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU20_5" data-id="NU20_5">and why hast thou brought us up out of Egypt to bring us in  unto this evil place? no place of seed, and fig, and vine, and  pomegranate; and water there is none to drink.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU20_6" data-id="NU20_6">And Moses and Aaron go in from the presence of the assembly  unto the opening of the tent of meeting, and fall on their  faces, and the honour of Jehovah is seen by them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU20_7" data-id="NU20_7">And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU20_10" data-id="NU20_10">and Moses and Aaron assemble the assembly unto the front  of the rock, and he saith to them, `Hear, I pray you, O rebels,  from this rock do we bring out to you water?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU20_11" data-id="NU20_11">and Moses lifteth up his hand, and smiteth the rock with  his rod twice; and much water cometh out, and the company  drink, also their beasts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU20_12" data-id="NU20_12">And Jehovah saith unto Moses, and unto Aaron, `Because ye  have not believed in Me to sanctify Me before the eyes of the  sons of Israel, therefore ye do not bring in this assembly unto  the land which I have given to them.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU20_13" data-id="NU20_13">These [are] waters of Meribah, because the sons of Israel  have `striven' with Jehovah, and He is sanctified upon them.</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU20_17" data-id="NU20_17">Let us pass over, we pray thee, through thy land; we pass  not over through a field, or through a vineyard, nor do we  drink waters of a well; the way of the king we go, we turn not  aside -- right or left -- till that we pass over thy border.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU20_18" data-id="NU20_18">And Edom saith unto him, `Thou dost not pass over through  me, lest with sword I come out to meet thee.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU20_20" data-id="NU20_20">And he saith, `Thou dost not pass over;' and Edom cometh  out to meet him with much people, and with a strong hand;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU20_21" data-id="NU20_21">and Edom refuseth to suffer Israel to pass over through  his border, and Israel turneth aside from off him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU20_22" data-id="NU20_22">And the sons of Israel, the whole company, journey from  Kadesh, and come in unto mount Hor,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU20_23" data-id="NU20_23">and Jehovah speaketh unto Moses and unto Aaron in mount  Hor, on the border of the land of Edom, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU20_24" data-id="NU20_24">`Aaron is gathered unto his people, for he doth not go in  unto the land which I have given to the sons of Israel, because  that ye provoked My mouth at the waters of Meribah.</span>

<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU20_27" data-id="NU20_27">And Moses doth as Jehovah hath commanded, and they go up  unto mount Hor before the eyes of all the company,</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU20_28" data-id="NU20_28">and Moses strippeth Aaron of his garments, and clotheth  with them Eleazar his son, and Aaron dieth there on the top of  the mount; and Moses cometh down -- Eleazar also -- from the  mount,</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU20_29" data-id="NU20_29">and all the company see that Aaron hath expired, and they  bewail Aaron thirty days -- all the house of Israel.</span>
