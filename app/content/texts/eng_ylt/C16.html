<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_2" data-id="C16_2">have ye not known that the saints shall judge the world? and  if by you the world is judged, are ye unworthy of the smaller  judgments?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_3" data-id="C16_3">have ye not known that we shall judge messengers? why not  then the things of life?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_4" data-id="C16_4">of the things of life, indeed, then, if ye may have  judgment, those despised in the assembly -- these cause ye to  sit;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_5" data-id="C16_5">unto your shame I speak: so there is not among you one wise  man, not even one, who shall be able to discern in the midst of  his brethren!</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_6" data-id="C16_6">but brother with brother doth go to be judged, and this  before unbelievers!</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_7" data-id="C16_7">Already, indeed, then, there is altogether a fault among  you, that ye have judgments with one another; wherefore do ye  not rather suffer injustice? wherefore be ye not rather  defrauded?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_8" data-id="C16_8">but ye -- ye do injustice, and ye defraud, and these --  brethren!</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_9" data-id="C16_9">have ye not known that the unrighteous the reign of God  shall not inherit? be not led astray; neither whoremongers, nor  idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor sodomites,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_10" data-id="C16_10">nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor  extortioners, the reign of God shall inherit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_11" data-id="C16_11">And certain of you were these! but ye were washed, but ye  were sanctified, but ye were declared righteous, in the name of  the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_12" data-id="C16_12">All things are lawful to me, but all things are not  profitable; all things are lawful to me, but I -- I will not be  under authority by any;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_13" data-id="C16_13">the meats [are] for the belly, and the belly for the meats.  And God both this and these shall make useless; and the body  [is] not for whoredom, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the  body;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_14" data-id="C16_14">and God both the Lord did raise, and us will raise up  through His power.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_15" data-id="C16_15">Have ye not known that your bodies are members of Christ?  having taken, then, the members of the Christ, shall I make  [them] members of an harlot? let it be not!</span>

<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_19" data-id="C16_19">Have ye not known that your body is a sanctuary of the Holy  Spirit in you, which ye have from God? and ye are not your own,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_20" data-id="C16_20">for ye were bought with a price; glorify, then, God in your  body and in your spirit, which are God's.</span>
