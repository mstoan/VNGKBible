<div class="c">9</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC9_1" data-id="EC9_1">But all this I have laid unto my heart, so as to clear up  the whole of this, that the righteous and the wise, and their  works, [are] in the hand of God, neither love nor hatred doth  man know, the whole [is] before them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC9_2" data-id="EC9_2">The whole [is] as to the whole; one event is to the  righteous and to the wicked, to the good, and to the clean, and  to the unclean, and to him who is sacrificing, and to him who  is not sacrificing; as [is] the good, so [is] the sinner, he  who is swearing as he who is fearing an oath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC9_3" data-id="EC9_3">This [is] an evil among all that hath been done under the  sun, that one event [is] to all, and also the heart of the sons  of man is full of evil, and madness [is] in their heart during  their life, and after it -- unto the dead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC9_4" data-id="EC9_4">But [to] him who is joined unto all the living there is  confidence, for to a living dog it [is] better than to the dead  lion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC9_5" data-id="EC9_5">For the living know that they die, and the dead know not  anything, and there is no more to them a reward, for their  remembrance hath been forgotten.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC9_6" data-id="EC9_6">Their love also, their hatred also, their envy also, hath  already perished, and they have no more a portion to the age in  all that hath been done under the sun.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC9_7" data-id="EC9_7">Go, eat with joy thy bread, and drink with a glad heart thy  wine, for already hath God been pleased with thy works.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC9_8" data-id="EC9_8">At all times let thy garments be white, and let not perfume  be lacking on thy head.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC9_9" data-id="EC9_9">See life with the wife whom thou hast loved, all the days of  the life of thy vanity, that He hath given to thee under the  sun, all the days of thy vanity, for it [is] thy portion in  life, even of thy labour that thou art labouring at under the  sun.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC9_10" data-id="EC9_10">All that thy hand findeth to do, with thy power do, for  there is no work, and device, and knowledge, and wisdom in  Sheol whither thou art going.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC9_11" data-id="EC9_11">I have turned so as to see under the sun, that not to the  swift [is] the race, nor to the mighty the battle, nor even to  the wise bread, nor even to the intelligent wealth, nor even to  the skilful grace, for time and chance happen with them all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC9_12" data-id="EC9_12">For even man knoweth not his time; as fish that are taken  hold of by an evil net, and as birds that are taken hold of by  a snare, like these [are] the sons of man snared at an evil  time, when it falleth upon them suddenly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC9_13" data-id="EC9_13">This also I have seen: wisdom under the sun, and it is  great to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC9_14" data-id="EC9_14">A little city, and few men in it, and a great king hath  come unto it, and hath surrounded it, and hath built against it  great bulwarks;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC9_15" data-id="EC9_15">and there hath been found in it a poor wise man, and he  hath delivered the city by his wisdom, and men have not  remembered that poor man!</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC9_16" data-id="EC9_16">And I said, `Better [is] wisdom than might, and the wisdom  of the poor is despised, and his words are not heard.' --</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC9_17" data-id="EC9_17">The words of the wise in quiet are heard, More than the cry  of a ruler over fools.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC9_18" data-id="EC9_18">Better [is] wisdom than weapons of conflict,  And one  sinner destroyeth much good!</span>
