<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV7_2" data-id="RV7_2">and I saw another messenger going up from the rising of the  sun, having a seal of the living God, and he did cry with a  great voice to the four messengers, to whom it was given to  injure the land and the sea, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV7_3" data-id="RV7_3">`Do not injure the land, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we  may seal the servants of our God upon their foreheads.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV7_4" data-id="RV7_4">And I heard the number of those sealed, (144 thousands were  sealed out of all the tribes of the sons of Israel):</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV7_5" data-id="RV7_5">of the tribe of Judah 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe  of Reuben 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Gad 12  thousand were sealed;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV7_6" data-id="RV7_6">of the tribe of Asher 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe  of Naphtali 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Manasseh  12 thousand were sealed;</span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV7_8" data-id="RV7_8">of the tribe of Zebulun 12 thousand were sealed; of the  tribe of Joseph 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of  Benjamin 12 thousand were sealed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV7_9" data-id="RV7_9">After these things I saw, and lo, a great multitude, which  to number no one was able, out of all nations, and tribes, and  peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne, and before  the Lamb, arrayed in white robes, and palms in their hands,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV7_10" data-id="RV7_10">and crying with a great voice, saying, `The salvation [is]  to Him who is sitting upon the throne -- to our God, and to the  Lamb!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV7_11" data-id="RV7_11">And all the messengers stood around the throne, and the  elders and the four living creatures, and they fell upon their  face, and bowed before God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV7_12" data-id="RV7_12">saying, `Amen! the blessing, and the glory, and the wisdom,  and the thanksgiving, and the honour, and the power, and the  strength, [are] to our God -- to the ages of the ages! Amen!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV7_13" data-id="RV7_13">And answer did one of the elders, saying to me, `These, who  have been arrayed with the white robes -- who are they, and  whence came they?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV7_14" data-id="RV7_14">and I have said to him, `Sir, thou hast known;' and he said  to me, `These are those who are coming out of the great  tribulation, and they did wash their robes, and they made their  robes white in the blood of the Lamb;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV7_15" data-id="RV7_15">because of this are they before the throne of God, and they  do service to Him day and night in His sanctuary, and He who is  sitting upon the throne shall tabernacle over them;</span>
