<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_27" data-id="EK1_27">And I see as the colour of copper, as the appearance of  fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins  and upward, and from the appearance of his loins and downward,  I have seen as the appearance of fire, and brightness [is] to  it round about.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK1_28" data-id="EK1_28">As the appearance of the bow that is in a cloud in a day of  rain, so [is] the appearance of the brightness round about.</span>
