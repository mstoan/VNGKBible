<div class="c">13</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_1" data-id="RM13_1">Let every soul to the higher authorities be subject, for  there is no authority except from God, and the authorities  existing are appointed by God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_2" data-id="RM13_2">so that he who is setting himself against the authority,  against God's ordinance hath resisted; and those resisting, to  themselves shall receive judgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_3" data-id="RM13_3">For those ruling are not a terror to the good works, but to  the evil; and dost thou wish not to be afraid of the  authority? that which is good be doing, and thou shalt have  praise from it,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_4" data-id="RM13_4">for of God it is a ministrant to thee for good; and if that  which is evil thou mayest do, be fearing, for not in vain doth  it bear the sword; for of God it is a ministrant, an avenger  for wrath to him who is doing that which is evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_5" data-id="RM13_5">Wherefore it is necessary to be subject, not only because  of the wrath, but also because of the conscience,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_6" data-id="RM13_6">for because of this also pay ye tribute; for servants of  God they are, on this very thing attending continually;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_7" data-id="RM13_7">render, therefore, to all [their] dues; to whom tribute,  the tribute; to whom custom, the custom; to whom fear, the  fear; to whom honour, the honour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_8" data-id="RM13_8">To no one owe anything, except to love one another; for he  who is loving the other -- law he hath fulfilled,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_9" data-id="RM13_9">for, `Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt do no  murder, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false  testimony, Thou shalt not covet;' and if there is any other  command, in this word it is summed up, in this: `Thou shalt  love thy neighbor as thyself;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_10" data-id="RM13_10">the love to the neighbor doth work no ill; the love,  therefore, [is] the fulness of law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_11" data-id="RM13_11">And this, knowing the time, that for us, the hour already  [is] to be aroused out of sleep, for now nearer [is] our  salvation than when we did believe;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_12" data-id="RM13_12">the night did advance, and the day came nigh; let us lay  aside, therefore, the works of the darkness, and let us put on  the armour of the light;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_13" data-id="RM13_13">as in day-time, let us walk becomingly; not in revellings  and drunkennesses, not in chamberings and lasciviousnesses,  not in strife and emulation;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_14" data-id="RM13_14">but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and for the flesh  take no forethought -- for desires.</span>
