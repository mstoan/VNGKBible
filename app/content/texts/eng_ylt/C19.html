<div class="c">9</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_1" data-id="C19_1">Am not I an apostle? am not I free? Jesus Christ our Lord  have I not seen? my work are not ye in the Lord?</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_2" data-id="C19_2">if to others I am not an apostle -- yet doubtless to you I  am; for the seal of my apostleship are ye in the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_3" data-id="C19_3">My defence to those who examine me in this;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_4" data-id="C19_4">have we not authority to eat and to drink?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_5" data-id="C19_5">have we not authority a sister -- a wife -- to lead about,  as also the other apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and  Cephas?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_6" data-id="C19_6">or only I and Barnabas, have we not authority -- not to  work?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_7" data-id="C19_7">who doth serve as a soldier at his own charges at any time?  who doth plant a vineyard, and of its fruit doth not eat? or  who doth feed a flock, and of the milk of the flock doth not  eat?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_8" data-id="C19_8">According to man do I speak these things? or doth not also  the law say these things?</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_9" data-id="C19_9">for in the law of Moses it hath been written, `thou shalt  not muzzle an ox treading out corn;' for the oxen doth God  care?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_10" data-id="C19_10">or because of us by all means doth He say [it]? yes,  because of us it was written, because in hope ought the plower  to plow, and he who is treading [ought] of his hope to partake  in hope.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_11" data-id="C19_11">If we to you the spiritual things did sow -- great [is it]  if we your fleshly things do reap?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_12" data-id="C19_12">if others do partake of the authority over you -- not we  more? but we did not use this authority, but all things we  bear, that we may give no hindrance to the good news of the  Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_13" data-id="C19_13">Have ye not known that those working about the things of  the temple -- of the temple do eat, and those waiting at the  altar -- with the altar are partakers?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_14" data-id="C19_14">so also did the Lord direct to those proclaiming the good  news: of the good news to live.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_15" data-id="C19_15">And I have used none of these things; neither did I write  these things that it may be so done in my case, for [it is]  good for me rather to die, than that any one may make my  glorying void;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_16" data-id="C19_16">for if I may proclaim good news, it is no glorying for me,  for necessity is laid upon me, and wo is to me if I may not  proclaim good news;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_17" data-id="C19_17">for if willing I do this, I have a reward; and if  unwillingly -- with a stewardship I have been entrusted!</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_18" data-id="C19_18">What, then, is my reward? -- that proclaiming good news,  without charge I shall make the good news of the Christ, not to  abuse my authority in the good news;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_19" data-id="C19_19">for being free from all men, to all men I made myself  servant, that the more I might gain;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_20" data-id="C19_20">and I became to the Jews as a Jew, that Jews I might gain;  to those under law as under law, that those under law I might  gain;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_21" data-id="C19_21">to those without law, as without law -- (not being without  law to God, but within law to Christ) -- that I might gain  those without law;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_22" data-id="C19_22">I became to the infirm as infirm, that the infirm I might  gain; to all men I have become all things, that by all means I  may save some.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_23" data-id="C19_23">And this I do because of the good news, that a  fellow-partaker of it I may become;</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_24" data-id="C19_24">have ye not known that those running in a race -- all  indeed run, but one doth receive the prize? so run ye, that ye  may obtain;</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_25" data-id="C19_25">and every one who is striving, is in all things temperate;  these, indeed, then, that a corruptible crown they may receive,  but we an incorruptible;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_26" data-id="C19_26">I, therefore, thus run, not as uncertainly, thus I fight,  as not beating air;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_27" data-id="C19_27">but I chastise my body, and bring [it] into servitude, lest  by any means, having preached to others -- I myself may become  disapproved.</span>
