<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_2" data-id="EK7_2">An end, come hath the end on the four corners of the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_3" data-id="EK7_3">Now [is] the end unto thee, And I have sent Mine anger upon  thee, And judged thee according to thy ways, And set against  thee all thine abominations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_4" data-id="EK7_4">And no pity on thee hath Mine eye, nor do I spare, For thy  ways against thee I do set, And thine abominations are in thy  midst, And ye have known that I [am] Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_5" data-id="EK7_5">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Evil, a single evil, lo, it hath  come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_6" data-id="EK7_6">An end hath come, come hath the end, It hath waked for thee,  lo, it hath come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_7" data-id="EK7_7">Come hath the morning unto thee, O inhabitant of the land!  Come hath the time, near [is] a day of trouble, And not the  shouting of mountains.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_8" data-id="EK7_8">Now, shortly I pour out My fury on thee, And have completed  Mine anger against thee, And judged thee according to thy ways,  And set against thee all thine abominations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_9" data-id="EK7_9">And not pity doth Mine eye, nor do I spare, According to thy  ways unto thee I give, And thine abominations are in thy midst,  And ye have known that I [am] Jehovah the smiter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_10" data-id="EK7_10">Lo, the day, lo, it hath come, Gone forth hath the morning,  Blossomed hath the rod, flourished the pride.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_11" data-id="EK7_11">The violence hath risen to a rod of wickedness, There is  none of them, nor of their multitude, Nor of their noise, nor  is there wailing for them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_12" data-id="EK7_12">Come hath the time, arrived hath the day, The buyer doth  not rejoice, And the seller doth not become a mourner, For  wrath [is] unto all its multitude.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_13" data-id="EK7_13">For the seller to the sold thing turneth not, And yet among  the living [is] their life, For the vision [is] unto all its  multitude, It doth not turn back, And none by his iniquity doth  strengthen his life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_14" data-id="EK7_14">They have blown with a trumpet to prepare the whole, And  none is going to battle, For My wrath [is] unto all its  multitude.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_15" data-id="EK7_15">The sword [is] without, And the pestilence and the famine  within, He who is in a field by sword dieth, And he who is in a  city, Famine and pestilence devour him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_16" data-id="EK7_16">And escaped away have their fugitives, And they have been  on the mountains As doves of the valleys, All of them make a  noising -- each for his iniquity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_17" data-id="EK7_17">All the hands are feeble, and all knees go -- waters.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_18" data-id="EK7_18">And they have girded on sackcloth, And covered them hath  trembling, And unto all faces [is] shame, And on all their  heads -- baldness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_19" data-id="EK7_19">Their silver into out-places they cast, And their gold  impurity becometh. Their silver and their gold is not able to  deliver them, In a day of the wrath of Jehovah, Their soul they  do not satisfy, And their bowels they do not fill, For the  stumbling-block of their iniquity it hath been.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_20" data-id="EK7_20">As to the beauty of his ornament, For excellency He set it,  And the images of their abominations, Their detestable things  -- they made in it, Therefore I have given it to them for  impurity,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_21" data-id="EK7_21">And I have given it into the hand of the strangers for a  prey, And to the wicked of the land for a spoil, And they have  polluted it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_22" data-id="EK7_22">And I have turned My face from them, And they have polluted  My hidden place, Yea, come into it have destroyers, and  polluted it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_23" data-id="EK7_23">Make the chain; for the land Hath been full of bloody  judgments, And the city hath been full of violence.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_24" data-id="EK7_24">And I have brought in the wicked of the nations, And they  have possessed their houses, And I have caused to cease the  excellency of the strong, And polluted have been those  sanctifying them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_25" data-id="EK7_25">Destruction hath come, And they have sought peace, and  there is none.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_26" data-id="EK7_26">Mischief on mischief cometh, and report is on report, And  they have sought a vision from a prophet, And law doth perish  from the priest, And counsel from the elders,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK7_27" data-id="EK7_27">The king doth become a mourner, And a prince putteth on  desolation, And the hands of the people of the land are  troubled, From their own way I deal with them, And with their  own judgments I judge them, And they have known that I [am]  Jehovah!'</span>
