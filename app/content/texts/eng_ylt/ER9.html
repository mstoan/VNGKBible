<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER9_2" data-id="ER9_2">for they have taken of their daughters to them, and to their  sons, and the holy seed have mingled themselves among the  peoples of the lands, and the hand of the heads and of the  seconds have been first in this trespass.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER9_3" data-id="ER9_3">And at my hearing this word, I have rent my garment and my  upper robe, and pluck out of the hair of my head, and of my  beard, and sit astonished,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER9_4" data-id="ER9_4">and unto me are gathered every one trembling at the words of  the God of Israel, because of the trespass of the removal, and  I am sitting astonished till the present of the evening.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER9_5" data-id="ER9_5">And at the present of the evening I have risen from mine  affliction, and at my rending my garment and my upper robe, then  I bow down on my knees, and spread out my hands unto Jehovah my  God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER9_6" data-id="ER9_6">and say, `O my God, I have been ashamed, and have blushed to  lift up, O my God, my face unto Thee, for our iniquities have  increased over the head, and our guilt hath become great unto  the heavens.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER9_7" data-id="ER9_7">`From the days of our fathers we [are] in great guilt unto  this day, and in our iniquities we have been given -- we, our  kings, our priests -- into the hand of the kings of the lands,  with sword, with captivity, and with spoiling, and with shame  of face, as [at] this day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER9_8" data-id="ER9_8">`And now, as a small moment hath grace been from Jehovah our  God, to leave to us an escape, and to give to us a nail in His  holy place, by our God's enlightening our eyes, and by giving  us a little quickening in our servitude;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER9_9" data-id="ER9_9">for servants we [are], and in our servitude our God hath not  forsaken us, and stretcheth out unto us kindness before the  kings of Persia, to give to us a quickening to lift up the  house of our God, and to cause its wastes to cease, and to give  to us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER9_10" data-id="ER9_10">`And now, what do we say, O our God, after this? for we  have forsaken Thy commands,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER9_11" data-id="ER9_11">that Thou hast commanded by the hands of thy servants the  prophets, saying, The land into which ye are going to possess  it, [is] a land of impurity, by the impurity of the people of  the lands, by their abominations with which they have filled it  -- from mouth unto mouth -- by their uncleanness;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER9_12" data-id="ER9_12">and now, your daughters ye do not give to their sons, and  their daughters ye do not take to your sons, and ye do not seek  their peace, and their good -- unto the age, so that ye are  strong, and have eaten the good of the land, and given  possession to your sons unto the age.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER9_13" data-id="ER9_13">`And after all that hath come upon us for our evil works,  and for our great guilt (for Thou, O our God, hast kept back of  the rod from our iniquities, and hast given to us an escape  like this),</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER9_15" data-id="ER9_15">`O Jehovah, God of Israel, righteous [art] Thou, for we  have been left an escape, as [it is] this day; lo, we [are]  before Thee in our guilt, for there is none to stand before  Thee concerning this.'</span>
