<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_2" data-id="HS11_2">They have called to them rightly, They have gone from  before them, To lords they do sacrifice, And to graven images  they make perfume.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_3" data-id="HS11_3">And I have caused Ephraim to go on foot, Taking them by  their arms, And they have not known that I strengthened them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_4" data-id="HS11_4">With cords of man I do draw them, With thick cords of love,  And I am to them as a raiser up of a yoke on their jaws, And I  incline unto him -- I feed [him].</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_5" data-id="HS11_5">He turneth not back unto the land of Egypt, And Asshur --  he [is] his king, For they have refused to return.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_6" data-id="HS11_6">Grievous hath been the sword in his cities, And it hath  ended his bars, and consumed -- from their own counsels.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_7" data-id="HS11_7">And My people are hanging in suspense, about My returning,  And unto the Most High they do call, Together they exalt not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_8" data-id="HS11_8">How do I give thee up, O Ephraim? Do I deliver thee up, O  Israel? How do I make thee as Admah? Do I set thee as Zeboim?  Turned in Me is My heart, kindled together have been My  repentings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_9" data-id="HS11_9">I do not the fierceness of My anger, I turn not back to  destroy Ephraim, For God I [am], and not a man. In thy midst  the Holy One, and I enter not in enmity,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_10" data-id="HS11_10">After Jehovah they go -- as a lion He roareth, When He  doth roar, then tremble do the sons from the west.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_11" data-id="HS11_11">They tremble as a sparrow out of Egypt, And as a dove out  of the land of Asshur, And I have caused them to dwell in their  own houses, An affirmation of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_12" data-id="HS11_12">Compassed Me with feigning hath Ephraim, And with deceit  the house of Israel. And Judah again is ruling with God, And  with the Holy Ones [is] faithful!</span>
