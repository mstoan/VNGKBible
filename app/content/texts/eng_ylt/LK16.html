<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_2" data-id="LK16_2">and having called him, he said to him, What [is] this I  hear about thee? render the account of thy stewardship, for  thou mayest not any longer be steward.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_3" data-id="LK16_3">`And the steward said in himself, What shall I do, because  my lord doth take away the stewardship from me? to dig I am  not able, to beg I am ashamed: --</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_4" data-id="LK16_4">I have known what I shall do, that, when I may be removed  from the stewardship, they may receive me to their houses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_5" data-id="LK16_5">`And having called near each one of his lord's debtors, he  said to the first, How much dost thou owe to my lord?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_6" data-id="LK16_6">and he said, A hundred baths of oil; and he said to him,  Take thy bill, and having sat down write fifty.</span>
