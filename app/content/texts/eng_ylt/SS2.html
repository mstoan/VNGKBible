<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS2_2" data-id="SS2_2">So [is] my friend among the daughters!</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS2_3" data-id="SS2_3">As a citron among trees of the forest, So [is] my beloved  among the sons, In his shade I delighted, and sat down, And his  fruit [is] sweet to my palate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS2_4" data-id="SS2_4">He hath brought me in unto a house of wine, And his banner  over me [is] love,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS2_5" data-id="SS2_5">Sustain me with grape-cakes, Support me with citrons, for I  [am] sick with love.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS2_6" data-id="SS2_6">His left hand [is] under my head, And his right doth embrace  me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS2_7" data-id="SS2_7">I have adjured you, daughters of Jerusalem, By the roes or  by the hinds of the field, Stir not up nor wake the love till  she please!</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS2_8" data-id="SS2_8">The voice of my beloved! lo, this -- he is coming, Leaping  on the mountains, skipping on the hills.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS2_9" data-id="SS2_9">My beloved [is] like to a roe, Or to a young one of the  harts. Lo, this -- he is standing behind our wall, Looking from  the windows, Blooming from the lattice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS2_10" data-id="SS2_10">My beloved hath answered and said to me, `Rise up, my  friend, my fair one, and come away,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS2_11" data-id="SS2_11">For lo, the winter hath passed by, The rain hath passed  away -- it hath gone.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS2_12" data-id="SS2_12">The flowers have appeared in the earth, The time of the  singing hath come, And the voice of the turtle was heard in our  land,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS2_13" data-id="SS2_13">The fig-tree hath ripened her green figs, And the  sweet-smelling vines have given forth fragrance, Rise, come, my  friend, my fair one, yea, come away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS2_14" data-id="SS2_14">My dove, in clefts of the rock, In a secret place of the  ascent, Cause me to see thine appearance, Cause me to hear thy  voice, For thy voice [is] sweet, and thy appearance comely.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS2_15" data-id="SS2_15">Seize ye for us foxes, Little foxes -- destroyers of  vineyards, Even our sweet-smelling vineyards.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS2_16" data-id="SS2_16">My beloved [is] mine, and I [am] his, Who is delighting  among the lilies,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS2_17" data-id="SS2_17">Till the day doth break forth, And the shadows have fled  away, Turn, be like, my beloved, To a roe, or to a young one of  the harts, On the mountains of separation!</span>
