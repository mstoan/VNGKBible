<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB2_2" data-id="JB2_2">And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, `Whence camest thou?'  And the Adversary answereth Jehovah and saith, `From going to  and fro in the land, and from walking up and down in it.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB2_3" data-id="JB2_3">And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, `Hast thou set thy  heart unto My servant Job because there is none like him in the  land, a man perfect and upright, fearing God and turning aside  from evil? and still he is keeping hold on his integrity, and  thou dost move Me against him to swallow him up for nought!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB2_4" data-id="JB2_4">And the Adversary answereth Jehovah and saith, `A skin for a  skin, and all that a man hath he doth give for his life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB2_5" data-id="JB2_5">Yet, put forth, I pray Thee, Thy hand, and strike unto his  bone and unto his flesh -- if not: unto Thy face he doth bless  Thee!'</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB2_7" data-id="JB2_7">And the Adversary goeth forth from the presence of Jehovah,  and smiteth Job with a sore ulcer from the sole of his foot  unto his crown.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB2_8" data-id="JB2_8">And he taketh to him a potsherd to scrape himself with it,  and he is sitting in the midst of the ashes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB2_9" data-id="JB2_9">And his wife saith to him, `Still thou art keeping hold on  thine integrity: bless God and die.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB2_10" data-id="JB2_10">And he saith unto her, `As one of the foolish women  speaketh, thou speakest; yea, the good we receive from God, and  the evil we do not receive.' In all this Job hath not sinned  with his lips.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB2_11" data-id="JB2_11">And three of the friends of Job hear of all this evil that  hath come upon him, and they come in each from his place --  Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the  Naamathite -- and they are met together to come in to bemoan  him, and to comfort him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB2_12" data-id="JB2_12">and they lift up their eyes from afar and have not  discerned him, and they lift up their voice and weep, and rend  each his robe, and sprinkle dust on their heads -- heavenward.</span>
