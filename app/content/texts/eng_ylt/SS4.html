<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_2" data-id="SS4_2">Thy teeth as a row of the shorn ones That have come up from  the washing, For all of them are forming twins, And a bereaved  one is not among them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_3" data-id="SS4_3">As a thread of scarlet [are] thy lips, And thy speech [is]  comely, As the work of the pomegranate [is] thy temple behind  thy veil,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_4" data-id="SS4_4">As the tower of David [is] thy neck, built for an armoury,  The chief of the shields are hung on it, All shields of the  mighty.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_5" data-id="SS4_5">Thy two breasts [are] as two fawns, Twins of a roe, that are  feeding among lilies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_6" data-id="SS4_6">Till the day doth break forth, And the shadows have fled  away, I will get me unto the mountain of myrrh, And unto the  hill of frankincense.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_7" data-id="SS4_7">Thou [art] all fair, my friend, And a blemish there is not  in thee. Come from Lebanon, O spouse,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_8" data-id="SS4_8">Come from Lebanon, come thou in. Look from the top of Amana,  From the top of Shenir and Hermon, From the habitations of  lions, From the mountains of leopards.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_9" data-id="SS4_9">Thou hast emboldened me, my sister-spouse, Emboldened me  with one of thine eyes, With one chain of thy neck.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_10" data-id="SS4_10">How wonderful have been thy loves, my sister-spouse, How  much better have been thy loves than wine, And the fragrance of  thy perfumes than all spices.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_11" data-id="SS4_11">Thy lips drop honey, O spouse, Honey and milk [are] under  thy tongue, And the fragrance of thy garments [Is] as the  fragrance of Lebanon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_12" data-id="SS4_12">A garden shut up [is] my sister-spouse, A spring shut up --  a fountain sealed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_13" data-id="SS4_13">Thy shoots a paradise of pomegranates, With precious  fruits,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_14" data-id="SS4_14">Cypresses with nard -- nard and saffron, Cane and cinnamon,  With all trees of frankincense, Myrrh and aloes, with all chief  spices.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_15" data-id="SS4_15">A fount of gardens, a well of living waters, And flowings  from Lebanon!</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS4_16" data-id="SS4_16">Awake, O north wind, and come, O south, Cause my garden to  breathe forth, its spices let flow, Let my beloved come to his  garden, And eat its pleasant fruits!</span>
