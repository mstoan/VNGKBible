O Jehovah, God of my salvation, Daily I  have cried, nightly before Thee,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS88_2" data-id="PS88_2">My prayer cometh in before Thee, Incline Thine ear to my  loud cry,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS88_3" data-id="PS88_3">For my soul hath been full of evils, And my life hath come  to Sheol.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS88_4" data-id="PS88_4">I have been reckoned with those going down [to] the pit, I  have been as a man without strength.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS88_5" data-id="PS88_5">Among the dead -- free, As pierced ones lying in the grave,  Whom Thou hast not remembered any more, Yea, they by Thy hand  have been cut off.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS88_6" data-id="PS88_6">Thou hast put me in the lowest pit, In dark places, in  depths.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS88_7" data-id="PS88_7">Upon me hath Thy fury lain, And [with] all Thy breakers  Thou hast afflicted. Selah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS88_8" data-id="PS88_8">Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me, Thou hast made  me an abomination to them, Shut up -- I go not forth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS88_9" data-id="PS88_9">Mine eye hath grieved because of affliction, I called Thee,  O Jehovah, all the day, I have spread out unto Thee my hands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS88_10" data-id="PS88_10">To the dead dost Thou do wonders? Do Rephaim rise? do they  thank Thee? Selah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS88_11" data-id="PS88_11">Is Thy kindness recounted in the grave? Thy faithfulness  in destruction?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS88_12" data-id="PS88_12">Are Thy wonders known in the darkness? And Thy  righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS88_13" data-id="PS88_13">And I, unto Thee, O Jehovah, I have cried, And in the  morning doth my prayer come before Thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS88_14" data-id="PS88_14">Why, O Jehovah, castest Thou off my soul? Thou hidest Thy  face from me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS88_15" data-id="PS88_15">I [am] afflicted, and expiring from youth, I have borne  Thy terrors -- I pine away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS88_16" data-id="PS88_16">Over me hath Thy wrath passed, Thy terrors have cut me  off,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS88_17" data-id="PS88_17">They have surrounded me as waters all the day, They have  gone round against me together,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS88_18" data-id="PS88_18">Thou hast put far from me lover and friend, Mine  acquaintance [is] the place of darkness!</span>
