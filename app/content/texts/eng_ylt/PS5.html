<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS5_2" data-id="PS5_2">Be attentive to the voice of my cry, My king and my God, For  unto Thee I pray habitually.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS5_3" data-id="PS5_3">Jehovah, [at] morning Thou hearest my voice, [At] morning I  set in array for Thee, And I look out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS5_4" data-id="PS5_4">For not a God desiring wickedness [art] Thou, Evil  inhabiteth Thee not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS5_5" data-id="PS5_5">The boastful station not themselves before Thine eyes: Thou  hast hated all working iniquity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS5_6" data-id="PS5_6">Thou destroyest those speaking lies, A man of blood and  deceit Jehovah doth abominate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS5_7" data-id="PS5_7">And I, in the abundance of Thy kindness, I enter Thy house,  I bow myself toward Thy holy temple in Thy fear.</span>
