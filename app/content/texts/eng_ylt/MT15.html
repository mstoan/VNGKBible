<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_2" data-id="MT15_2">`Wherefore do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the  elders? for they do not wash their hands when they may eat  bread.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_3" data-id="MT15_3">And he answering said to them, `Wherefore also do ye  transgress the command of God because of your tradition?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_4" data-id="MT15_4">for God did command, saying, Honour thy father and mother;  and, He who is speaking evil of father or mother -- let him die  the death;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_5" data-id="MT15_5">but ye say, Whoever may say to father or mother, An  offering [is] whatever thou mayest be profited by me; --</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_6" data-id="MT15_6">and he may not honour his father or his mother, and ye did  set aside the command of God because of your tradition.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_7" data-id="MT15_7">`Hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_8" data-id="MT15_8">This people doth draw nigh to Me with their mouth, and with  the lips it doth honour Me, but their heart is far off from Me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_9" data-id="MT15_9">and in vain do they worship Me, teaching teachings --  commands of men.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_10" data-id="MT15_10">And having called near the multitude, he said to them,  `Hear and understand:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_11" data-id="MT15_11">not that which is coming into the mouth doth defile the  man, but that which is coming forth from the mouth, this  defileth the man.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_12" data-id="MT15_12">Then his disciples having come near, said to him, `Hast  thou known that the Pharisees, having heard the word, were  stumbled?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_13" data-id="MT15_13">And he answering said, `Every plant that my heavenly  Father did not plant shall be rooted up;</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_15" data-id="MT15_15">And Peter answering said to him, `Explain to us this  simile.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_16" data-id="MT15_16">And Jesus said, `Are ye also yet without understanding?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_17" data-id="MT15_17">do ye not understand that all that is going into the mouth  doth pass into the belly, and into the drain is cast forth?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_18" data-id="MT15_18">but the things coming forth from the mouth from the heart  do come forth, and these defile the man;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_19" data-id="MT15_19">for out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders,  adulteries, whoredoms, thefts, false witnessings, evil  speakings:</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_20" data-id="MT15_20">these are the things defiling the man; but to eat with  unwashen hands doth not defile the man.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_21" data-id="MT15_21">And Jesus having come forth thence, withdrew to the parts  of Tyre and Sidon,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_22" data-id="MT15_22">and lo, a woman, a Canaanitess, from those borders having  come forth, did call to him, saying, `Deal kindly with me, Sir  -- Son of David; my daughter is miserably demonized.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_23" data-id="MT15_23">And he did not answer her a word; and his disciples having  come to him, were asking him, saying -- `Let her away, because  she crieth after us;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_24" data-id="MT15_24">and he answering said, `I was not sent except to the lost  sheep of the house of Israel.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_25" data-id="MT15_25">And having come, she was bowing to him, saying, `Sir, help  me;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_26" data-id="MT15_26">and he answering said, `It is not good to take the  children's bread, and to cast to the little dogs.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_27" data-id="MT15_27">And she said, `Yes, sir, for even the little dogs do eat  of the crumbs that are falling from their lords' table;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_28" data-id="MT15_28">then answering, Jesus said to her, `O woman, great [is]  thy faith, let it be to thee as thou wilt;' and her daughter  was healed from that hour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_29" data-id="MT15_29">And Jesus having passed thence, came nigh unto the sea of  Galilee, and having gone up to the mountain, he was sitting  there,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_30" data-id="MT15_30">and there came to him great multitudes, having with them  lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they did cast  them at the feet of Jesus, and he healed them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_31" data-id="MT15_31">so that the multitudes did wonder, seeing dumb ones  speaking, maimed whole, lame walking, and blind seeing; and  they glorified the God of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_32" data-id="MT15_32">And Jesus having called near his disciples, said, `I have  compassion upon the multitude, because now three days they  continue with me, and they have not what they may eat; and to  let them away fasting I will not, lest they faint in the way.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_33" data-id="MT15_33">And his disciples say to him, `Whence to us, in a  wilderness, so many loaves, as to fill so great a multitude?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_34" data-id="MT15_34">And Jesus saith to them, `How many loaves have ye?' and  they said, `Seven, and a few little fishes.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_35" data-id="MT15_35">And he commanded the multitudes to sit down upon the  ground,</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_36" data-id="MT15_36">and having taken the seven loaves and the fishes, having  given thanks, he did break, and gave to his disciples, and the  disciples to the multitude.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_37" data-id="MT15_37">And they did all eat, and were filled, and they took up  what was over of the broken pieces seven baskets full,</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_38" data-id="MT15_38">and those eating were four thousand men, apart from women  and children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT15_39" data-id="MT15_39">And having let away the multitudes, he went into the boat,  and did come to the borders of Magdala.</span>
