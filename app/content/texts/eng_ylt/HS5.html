<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_2" data-id="HS5_2">And to slaughter sinners have gone deep, And I [am] a fetter  to them all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_3" data-id="HS5_3">I have known Ephraim, And Israel hath not been hid from me,  For now thou hast gone a-whoring, Ephraim, Defiled is Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_4" data-id="HS5_4">They give not up their habitual doings, To turn back unto  their God, For a spirit of whoredoms [is] in their midst, And  Jehovah they have not known.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_5" data-id="HS5_5">And humbled hath been the excellency of Israel to his face,  And Israel and Ephraim stumble by their iniquity, Stumbled also  hath Judah with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_6" data-id="HS5_6">With their flock and with their herd, They go to seek  Jehovah, and do not find, He hath withdrawn from them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_7" data-id="HS5_7">Against Jehovah they dealt treacherously, For strange sons  they have begotten, Now consume them doth a month [with] their  portions.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_8" data-id="HS5_8">Blow ye a cornet in Gibeah, a trumpet in Ramah, Shout, O  Beth-Aven, after thee, O Benjamin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_9" data-id="HS5_9">Ephraim is for a desolation in a day of reproof, Among the  tribes of Israel I have made known a sure thing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_10" data-id="HS5_10">Princes of Judah have been as those removing a border, On  them I do pour out as water My wrath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_11" data-id="HS5_11">Oppressed is Ephraim, broken in judgment, When he pleased he  went after the command.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_12" data-id="HS5_12">And I [am] as a moth to Ephraim, And as a rotten thing to  the house of Judah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_13" data-id="HS5_13">And see doth Ephraim his sickness, and Judah his wound, And  Ephraim goeth unto Asshur, And sendeth unto a warlike king, And  he is not able to give healing to you, Nor doth he remove from  you a scar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_14" data-id="HS5_14">For I [am] as a lion to Ephraim, And as a young lion to the  house of Judah, I -- I tear and go, I bear away, and there is  no deliverer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_15" data-id="HS5_15">I go -- I turn back unto My place, Till that they are  desolate, and have sought My face. In their distress they do  seek Me speedily!'</span>
