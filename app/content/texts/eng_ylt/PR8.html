<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR8_3" data-id="PR8_3">At the side of the gates, at the mouth of the city, The  entrance of the openings, she crieth aloud,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR8_4" data-id="PR8_4">`Unto you, O men, I call, And my voice [is] unto the sons of  men.</span>

<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR8_29" data-id="PR8_29">In His setting for the sea its limit, And the waters  transgress not His command, In His decreeing the foundations of  earth,</span>
