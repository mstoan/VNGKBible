<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER7_24" data-id="ER7_24">`And to you we are making known, that upon any of the  priests and Levites, singers, gatekeepers, Nethinim, and  servants of the house of God, tribute and custom there is no  authority to lift up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER7_25" data-id="ER7_25">`And thou, Ezra, according to the wisdom of thy God, that  [is] in thy hand, appoint magistrates and judges who may be  judges to all the people who are beyond the river, to all  knowing the law of thy God, and he who hath not known ye cause  to know;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER7_26" data-id="ER7_26">and any who doth not do the law of thy God, and the law of  the king, speedily is judgment done upon him, whether to death,  or to banishment, or to confiscation of riches, and to bonds.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER7_27" data-id="ER7_27">Blessed [is] Jehovah, God of our fathers, who hath given  such a thing as this in the heart of the king, to beautify the  house of Jehovah that [is] in Jerusalem,</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER7_28" data-id="ER7_28">and unto me hath stretched out kindness before the king and  his counsellors, and before all the mighty heads of the king:  and I have strengthened myself as the hand of Jehovah my God  [is] upon me, and I gather out of Israel heads to go up with  me.</span>
