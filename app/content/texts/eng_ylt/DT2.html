<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT2_4" data-id="DT2_4">`And the people command thou, saying, Ye are passing over  into the border of your brethren, sons of Esau, who are  dwelling in Seir, and they are afraid of you; and ye have been  very watchful,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT2_5" data-id="DT2_5">ye do not strive with them, for I do not give to you of  their land even the treading of the sole of a foot; for a  possession to Esau I have given mount Seir.</span>
