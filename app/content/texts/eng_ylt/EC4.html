<div class="c">4</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_1" data-id="EC4_1">And I have turned, and I see all the oppressions that are  done under the sun, and lo, the tear of the oppressed, and they  have no comforter; and at the hand of their oppressors [is]  power, and they have no comforter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_2" data-id="EC4_2">And I am praising the dead who have already died above the  living who are yet alive.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_3" data-id="EC4_3">And better than both of them [is] he who hath not yet been,  in that he hath not seen the evil work that hath been done  under the sun.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_4" data-id="EC4_4">And I have seen all the labour, and all the benefit of the  work, because for it a man is the envy of his neighbour. Even  this [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_5" data-id="EC4_5">The fool is clasping his hands, and eating his own flesh:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_6" data-id="EC4_6">`Better [is] a handful [with] quietness, than two handfuls  [with] labour and vexation of spirit.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_7" data-id="EC4_7">And I have turned, and I see a vain thing under the sun:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_8" data-id="EC4_8">There is one, and there is not a second; even son or brother  he hath not, and there is no end to all his labour! His eye  also is not satisfied with riches, and [he saith not], `For  whom am I labouring and bereaving my soul of good?' This also  is vanity, it is a sad travail.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_9" data-id="EC4_9">The two [are] better than the one, in that they have a good  reward by their labour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_10" data-id="EC4_10">For if they fall, the one raiseth up his companion, but wo  to the one who falleth and there is not a second to raise him  up!</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_11" data-id="EC4_11">Also, if two lie down, then they have heat, but how hath  one heat?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_12" data-id="EC4_12">And if the one strengthen himself, the two stand against  him; and the threefold cord is not hastily broken.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_13" data-id="EC4_13">Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish  king, who hath not known to be warned any more.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_14" data-id="EC4_14">For from a house of prisoners he hath come out to reign,  for even in his own kingdom he hath been poor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_15" data-id="EC4_15">I have seen all the living, who are walking under the sun,  with the second youth who doth stand in his place;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_16" data-id="EC4_16">there is no end to all the people, to all who were before  them; also, the latter rejoice not in him. Surely this also is  vanity and vexation of spirit.</span>
