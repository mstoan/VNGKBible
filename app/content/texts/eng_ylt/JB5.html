<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB5_2" data-id="JB5_2">For provocation slayeth the perverse, And envy putteth to  death the simple,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB5_3" data-id="JB5_3">I -- I have seen the perverse taking root, And I mark his  habitation straightway,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB5_4" data-id="JB5_4">Far are his sons from safety, And they are bruised in the  gate, And there is no deliverer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB5_5" data-id="JB5_5">Whose harvest the hungry doth eat, And even from the thorns  taketh it, And the designing swallowed their wealth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB5_6" data-id="JB5_6">For sorrow cometh not forth from the dust, Nor from the  ground springeth up misery.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB5_7" data-id="JB5_7">For man to misery is born, And the sparks go high to fly.</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB5_12" data-id="JB5_12">Making void thoughts of the subtile, And their hands do not  execute wisdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB5_13" data-id="JB5_13">Capturing the wise in their subtilty, And the counsel of  wrestling ones was hastened,</span>
