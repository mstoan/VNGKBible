<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH4_2" data-id="NH4_2">and saith before his brethren and the force of Samaria, yea,  he saith, `What [are] the weak Jews doing? are they left to  themselves? do they sacrifice? do they complete in a day? do  they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish? -- and  they burnt!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH4_3" data-id="NH4_3">And Tobiah the Ammonite [is] by him and saith, `Also, that  which they are building -- if a fox doth go up, then it hath  broken down their stone wall.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH4_4" data-id="NH4_4">Hear, O our God, for we have been despised; and turn back  their reproach on their own head, and give them for a spoil in  a land of captivity;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH4_5" data-id="NH4_5">and do not cover over their iniquity, and their sin from  before Thee let not be blotted out, for they have provoked to  anger -- over-against those building.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH4_6" data-id="NH4_6">And we build the wall, and all the wall is joined -- unto  its half, and the people have a heart to work.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH4_7" data-id="NH4_7">And it cometh to pass, when Sanballat hath heard, and  Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the  Ashdodites, that lengthening hath gone up to the walls of  Jerusalem, that the breeches have begun to be stopped, then it  is very displeasing to them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH4_8" data-id="NH4_8">and they conspire, all of them together, to come in to fight  against Jerusalem, and to do to it injury.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH4_9" data-id="NH4_9">And we pray unto our God, and appoint a watch against them,  by day and by night, because of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH4_10" data-id="NH4_10">And Judah saith, `The power of the burden-bearers hath  become feeble, and the rubbish [is] abundant, and we are not  able to build on the wall.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH4_11" data-id="NH4_11">And our adversaries say, `They do not know, nor see, till  that we come in to their midst, and have slain them, and caused  the work to cease.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH4_12" data-id="NH4_12">And it cometh to pass, when the Jews have come who are  dwelling near them, that they say to us ten times from all the  places whither ye return -- [they are] against us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH4_13" data-id="NH4_13">And I appoint at the lowest of the places, at the back of  the wall, in the clear places, yea, I appoint the people, by  their families, with their swords, their spears, and their  bows.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH4_14" data-id="NH4_14">And I see, and rise up, and say unto the freemen, and unto  the prefects, and unto the rest of the people, `Be not afraid  of them; the Lord, the great and the fearful, remember ye, and  fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your  wives, and your houses.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH4_15" data-id="NH4_15">And it cometh to pass, when our enemies have heard that it  hath been known to us, and God doth frustrate their counsel,  and we turn back, all of us, unto the wall, each unto his work;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH4_16" data-id="NH4_16">yea, it cometh to pass, from that day, half of my servants  are working in the business, and half of them are keeping hold  of both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of  mail; and the heads [are] behind all the house of Judah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH4_17" data-id="NH4_17">The builders on the wall, and the bearers of the burden,  those lading, [each] with one of his hands is working in the  business, and one is laying hold of the missile.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH4_18" data-id="NH4_18">And the builders [are] each with his sword, girded on his  loins, and building, and he who is blowing with a trumpet [is]  beside me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH4_19" data-id="NH4_19">And I say unto the freemen, and unto the prefects, and unto  the rest of the people, `The work is abundant, and large, and  we are separated on the wall, far off one from another;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH4_20" data-id="NH4_20">in the place that ye hear the voice of the trumpet thither  ye are gathered unto us; our God doth fight for us.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH4_21" data-id="NH4_21">And we are working in the business, and half of them are  keeping hold of the spears, from the going up of the dawn till  the coming forth of the stars.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH4_22" data-id="NH4_22">Also, at that time I said to the people, `Let each with his  servant lodge in the midst of Jerusalem, and they have been to  us by night a guard, and by day [for] the work:'</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH4_23" data-id="NH4_23">and there are none -- I and my brethren and my servants,  the men of the guard who [are] after me -- there are none of us  putting off our garments, each [hath] his vessel of water.</span>
