<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS33_2" data-id="IS33_2">O Jehovah, favour us, for thee we have waited, Be their  arm, in the mornings, Yea, our salvation in time of adversity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS33_3" data-id="IS33_3">From the voice of a multitude fled have peoples, From thine  exaltation scattered have been nations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS33_4" data-id="IS33_4">And gathered hath been your spoil, A gathering of the  caterpillar, As a running to and fro of locusts is he running  on it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS33_5" data-id="IS33_5">Set on high is Jehovah, for He is dwelling on high, He  filled Zion [with] judgment and righteousness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS33_6" data-id="IS33_6">And hath been the stedfastness of thy times, The strength  of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge, Fear of Jehovah -- it [is]  His treasure.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS33_7" data-id="IS33_7">Lo, `Their Ariel,' they have cried without, Messengers of  peace do weep bitterly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS33_8" data-id="IS33_8">Desolated have been highways, Ceased hath he who passeth  along the path, He hath broken covenant, He hath despised  enemies, He hath not esteemed a man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS33_9" data-id="IS33_9">Mourned, languished hath the land, Confounded hath been  Lebanon, Withered hath been Sharon as a wilderness, And shaking  are Bashan and Carmel.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS33_14" data-id="IS33_14">Afraid in Zion have been sinners, Seized hath trembling  the profane: Who doth dwell for us -- consuming fire, Who doth  dwell for us -- burnings of the age?</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS33_15" data-id="IS33_15">Whoso is walking righteously, And is speaking uprightly,  Kicking against gain of oppressions, Shaking his hands from  taking hold on a bribe, Stopping his ear from hearing of blood,  And shutting his eyes from looking on evil,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS33_16" data-id="IS33_16">He high places doth inhabit, Strongholds of rock [are] his  high tower, His bread hath been given, his waters stedfast.</span>

<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS33_19" data-id="IS33_19">The strong people thou seest not, A people deeper of lip  than to be understood, Of a scorned tongue, there is no  understanding.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS33_20" data-id="IS33_20">See Zion, the city of our meetings, Thine eyes see  Jerusalem a quiet habitation, A tent not taken down, Not  removed are its pins for ever, And none of its cords are  broken.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS33_21" data-id="IS33_21">But there mighty [is] Jehovah for us, A place of rivers --  streams broad of sides, No ship with oars doth go into it, And  a mighty ship doth not pass over it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS33_22" data-id="IS33_22">For Jehovah our judge, Jehovah our lawgiver, Jehovah our  king -- He doth save us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS33_23" data-id="IS33_23">Left have been thy ropes, They strengthen not rightly  their mast, They have not spread out a sail, Then apportioned  hath been a prey of much spoil, The lame have taken spoil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS33_24" data-id="IS33_24">Nor doth an inhabitant say, `I was sick,' The people that  is dwelling in it, is forgiven of iniquity!</span>
