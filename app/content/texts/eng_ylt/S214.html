<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S214_3" data-id="S214_3">and thou hast gone unto the king, and spoken unto him,  according to this word;' and Joab putteth the words into her  mouth.</span>

<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v S214_25" data-id="S214_25">And like Absalom there was no man [so] fair in all Israel,  to praise greatly; from the sole of his foot even unto his  crown there was no blemish in him;</span>

<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v S214_27" data-id="S214_27">And there are born to Absalom three sons, and one  daughter, and her name [is] Tamar; she was a woman of a fair  appearance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v S214_28" data-id="S214_28">And Absalom dwelleth in Jerusalem two years of days, and  the face of the king he hath not seen;</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v S214_29" data-id="S214_29">and Absalom sendeth unto Joab, to send him unto the king,  and he hath not been willing to come unto him; and he sendeth  again a second time, and he hath not been willing to come.</span>
