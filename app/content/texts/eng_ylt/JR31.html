<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_2" data-id="JR31_2">Thus said Jehovah: Found grace in the wilderness Hath a  people remaining from the sword Going to cause it to rest --  Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_3" data-id="JR31_3">From afar Jehovah hath appeared to me, With love age-during  I have loved thee, Therefore I have drawn thee [with] kindness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_4" data-id="JR31_4">Again do I build thee, And thou hast been built, O virgin  of Israel, Again thou puttest on thy tabrets, And hast gone out  in the chorus of the playful.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_5" data-id="JR31_5">Again thou dost plant vineyards In mountains of Samaria,  Planters have planted, and made common.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_6" data-id="JR31_6">For there is a day, Cried have watchmen on mount Ephraim,  `Rise, and we go up to Zion, unto Jehovah our God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_7" data-id="JR31_7">For thus said Jehovah: Sing, O ye to Jacob, [with] joy, And  cry aloud at the head of the nations, Sound ye, praise ye, and  say, Save, O Jehovah, thy people, the remnant of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_8" data-id="JR31_8">Lo, I am bringing them in from the north country, And have  gathered them from the sides of the earth, Among them [are]  blind and lame, Conceiving and travailing one -- together, A  great assembly -- they turn back hither.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_9" data-id="JR31_9">With weeping they come in, And with supplications I bring  them, I cause them to go unto streams of waters, In a right way  -- they stumble not in it, For I have been to Israel for a  father, And Ephraim -- My first-born [is] he.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_10" data-id="JR31_10">Hear a word of Jehovah, O nations, And declare ye among  isles afar off, and say: He who is scattering Israel doth  gather him, And hath kept him as a shepherd [doth] his flock,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_11" data-id="JR31_11">For Jehovah hath ransomed Jacob, And redeemed him from a  hand stronger than he.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_12" data-id="JR31_12">And they have come in, And have sung in the high place of  Zion, And flowed unto the goodness of Jehovah, For wheat, and  for new wine, and for oil, And for the young of the flock and  herd, And their soul hath been as a watered garden, And they  add not to grieve any more.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_13" data-id="JR31_13">Then rejoice doth a virgin in a chorus, Both young men and  old men -- together, And I have turned their mourning to joy,  And have comforted them, And gladdened them above their sorrow,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_14" data-id="JR31_14">And satisfied the soul of the priests [with] fatness, And  My people with My goodness are satisfied, An affirmation of  Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_15" data-id="JR31_15">Thus said Jehovah, A voice in Ramah is heard, wailing,  weeping most bitter, Rachel is weeping for her sons, She hath  refused to be comforted for her sons, because they are not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_16" data-id="JR31_16">Thus said Jehovah: Withhold thy voice from weeping, and  thine eyes from tears, For there is a reward for thy work, An  affirmation of Jehovah, And they have turned back from the land  of the enemy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_17" data-id="JR31_17">And there is hope for thy latter end, An affirmation of  Jehovah, And the sons have turned back [to] their border.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_18" data-id="JR31_18">I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself, `Thou hast  chastised me, And I am chastised, as a heifer not taught, Turn  me back, and I turn back, For thou [art] Jehovah my God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_19" data-id="JR31_19">For after my turning back I repented, And after my being  instructed I struck on the thigh, I have been ashamed, I have  also blushed, For I have borne the reproach of my youth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_20" data-id="JR31_20">A precious son is Ephraim to Me? A child of delights? For  since My speaking against him, I do thoroughly remember him  still, Therefore have My bowels been moved for him, I do  greatly love him, An affirmation of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_21" data-id="JR31_21">Set up for thee signs, make for thee heaps, Set thy heart  to the highway, the way thou wentest, Turn back, O virgin of  Israel, Turn back unto these thy cities.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_22" data-id="JR31_22">Till when dost thou withdraw thyself, O backsliding  daughter? For Jehovah hath prepared a new thing in the land,  Woman doth compass man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_23" data-id="JR31_23">Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, Still they say  this word in the land of Judah, And in its cities, In My  turning back [to] their captivity, Jehovah doth bless thee,  habitation of righteousness, Mountain of holiness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_24" data-id="JR31_24">And dwelt in Judah have husbandmen, and in all its cities  together, And they have journeyed in order.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_25" data-id="JR31_25">For I have satiated the weary soul, And every grieved soul  I have filled.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_26" data-id="JR31_26">On this I have awaked, and I behold, and my sleep hath  been sweet to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_27" data-id="JR31_27">Lo, days are coming, an affirmation of Jehovah, And I have  sown the house of Israel, And the house of Judah, With seed of  man, and seed of beast.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_28" data-id="JR31_28">And it hath been, as I watched over them to pluck up, And  to break down, and to throw down, And to destroy, and to  afflict; So do I watch over them to build, and to plant, An  affirmation of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_29" data-id="JR31_29">In those days they do not say any more: Fathers have eaten  unripe fruit, And the sons' teeth are blunted.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_30" data-id="JR31_30">But -- each for his own iniquity doth die, Every man who  is eating the unripe fruit, Blunted are his teeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_31" data-id="JR31_31">Lo, days are coming, an affirmation of Jehovah, And I have  made with the house of Israel And with the house of Judah a new  covenant,</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_32" data-id="JR31_32">Not like the covenant that I made with their fathers, In  the day of My laying hold on their hand, To bring them out of  the land of Egypt, In that they made void My covenant, And I  ruled over them -- an affirmation of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_33" data-id="JR31_33">For this [is] the covenant that I make, With the house of  Israel, after those days, An affirmation of Jehovah, I have  given My law in their inward part, And on their heart I do  write it, And I have been to them for God, And they are to me  for a people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_34" data-id="JR31_34">And they do not teach any more Each his neighbour, and  each his brother, Saying, Know ye Jehovah, For they all know  Me, from their least unto their greatest, An affirmation of  Jehovah; For I pardon their iniquity, And of their sin I make  mention no more.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_35" data-id="JR31_35">Thus said Jehovah, Who is giving the sun for a light by  day, The statutes of moon and stars for a light by night,  Quieting the sea when its billows roar, Jehovah of Hosts [is]  His name:</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_36" data-id="JR31_36">If these statutes depart from before Me, An affirmation of  Jehovah, Even the seed of Israel doth cease From being a nation  before Me all the days.</span>

<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_38" data-id="JR31_38">Lo, days [are coming], an affirmation of Jehovah, And the  city hath been built to Jehovah, From the tower of Hananeel to  the gate of the corner.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_39" data-id="JR31_39">And gone out again hath the measuring line Over-against  it, unto the height of Gareb, And it hath compassed to Goah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_40" data-id="JR31_40">And all the valley of the carcases and of the ashes, And  all the fields unto the brook Kidron, Unto the corner of the  horse-gate eastward, [Are] holy to Jehovah, it is not plucked  up, Nor is it thrown down any more to the age!</span>
