<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_2" data-id="MK16_2">and early in the morning of the first of the sabbaths, they  come unto the sepulchre, at the rising of the sun,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_3" data-id="MK16_3">and they said among themselves, `Who shall roll away for us  the stone out of the door of the sepulchre?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_4" data-id="MK16_4">And having looked, they see that the stone hath been rolled  away -- for it was very great,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_5" data-id="MK16_5">and having entered into the sepulchre, they saw a young man  sitting on the right hand, arrayed in a long white robe, and  they were amazed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_6" data-id="MK16_6">And he saith to them, `Be not amazed, ye seek Jesus the  Nazarene, the crucified: he did rise -- he is not here; lo,  the place where they laid him!</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_7" data-id="MK16_7">and go, say to his disciples, and Peter, that he doth go  before you to Galilee; there ye shall see him, as he said to  you.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_8" data-id="MK16_8">And, having come forth quickly, they fled from the  sepulchre, and trembling and amazement had seized them, and to  no one said they anything, for they were afraid.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_9" data-id="MK16_9">And he, having risen in the morning of the first of the  sabbaths, did appear first to Mary the Magdalene, out of whom  he had cast seven demons;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_10" data-id="MK16_10">she having gone, told those who had been with him,  mourning and weeping;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_11" data-id="MK16_11">and they, having heard that he is alive, and was seen by  her, did not believe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_12" data-id="MK16_12">And after these things, to two of them, as they are going  into a field, walking, he was manifested in another form,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_13" data-id="MK16_13">and they having gone, told to the rest; not even them did  they believe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_14" data-id="MK16_14">Afterwards, as they are reclining (at meat), he was  manifested to the eleven, and did reproach their unbelief and  stiffness of heart, because they believed not those having  seen him being raised;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_15" data-id="MK16_15">and he said to them, `Having gone to all the world,  proclaim the good news to all the creation;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_16" data-id="MK16_16">he who hath believed, and hath been baptized, shall be  saved; and he who hath not believed, shall be condemned.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_17" data-id="MK16_17">`And signs shall accompany those believing these things;  in my name demons they shall cast out; with new tongues they  shall speak;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_18" data-id="MK16_18">serpents they shall take up; and if any deadly thing they  may drink, it shall not hurt them; on the ailing they shall  lay hands, and they shall be well.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_19" data-id="MK16_19">The Lord, then, indeed, after speaking to them, was  received up to the heaven, and sat on the right hand of God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_20" data-id="MK16_20">and they, having gone forth, did preach everywhere, the  Lord working with [them], and confirming the word, through the  signs following. Amen.</span>
