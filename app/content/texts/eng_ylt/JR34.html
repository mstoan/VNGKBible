<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR34_2" data-id="JR34_2">`Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel: Go, and thou hast spoken  unto Zedekiah king of Judah, and hast said unto him, Thus said  Jehovah: Lo, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of  Babylon, and he hath burned it with fire,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR34_3" data-id="JR34_3">and thou, thou dost not escape out of his hand, for thou  art certainly caught, and into his hand thou art given, and  thine eyes see the eyes of the king of Babylon, and his mouth  with thy mouth speaketh, and Babylon thou enterest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR34_4" data-id="JR34_4">`Only, hear a word of Jehovah, O Zedekiah king of Judah,  Thus said Jehovah unto thee: Thou dost not die by sword,</span>
