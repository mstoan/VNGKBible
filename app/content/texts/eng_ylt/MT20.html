<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_2" data-id="MT20_2">and having agreed with the workmen for a denary a day, he  sent them into his vineyard.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_3" data-id="MT20_3">`And having gone forth about the third hour, he saw others  standing in the market-place idle,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_4" data-id="MT20_4">and to these he said, Go ye -- also ye -- to the vineyard,  and whatever may be righteous I will give you;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_5" data-id="MT20_5">and they went away. `Again, having gone forth about the  sixth and the ninth hour, he did in like manner.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_6" data-id="MT20_6">And about the eleventh hour, having gone forth, he found  others standing idle, and saith to them, Why here have ye stood  all the day idle?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_7" data-id="MT20_7">they say to him, Because no one did hire us; he saith to  them, Go ye -- ye also -- to the vineyard, and whatever may be  righteous ye shall receive.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_8" data-id="MT20_8">`And evening having come, the lord of the vineyard saith to  his steward, Call the workmen, and pay them the reward, having  begun from the last -- unto the first.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_9" data-id="MT20_9">And they of about the eleventh hour having come, did  receive each a denary.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_10" data-id="MT20_10">`And the first having come, did suppose that they shall  receive more, and they received, they also, each a denary,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_11" data-id="MT20_11">and having received [it], they were murmuring against the  householder, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_12" data-id="MT20_12">that These, the last, wrought one hour, and thou didst  make them equal to us, who were bearing the burden of the day  -- and the heat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_13" data-id="MT20_13">`And he answering said to one of them, Comrade, I do no  unrighteousness to thee; for a denary didst not thou agree with  me?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_14" data-id="MT20_14">take that which is thine, and go; and I will to give to  this, the last, also as to thee;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_15" data-id="MT20_15">is it not lawful to me to do what I will in mine own? is  thine eye evil because I am good?</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_16" data-id="MT20_16">So the last shall be first, and the first last, for many  are called, and few chosen.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_17" data-id="MT20_17">And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples  by themselves in the way, and said to them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_18" data-id="MT20_18">`Lo, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man shall be  delivered to the chief priests and scribes,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_19" data-id="MT20_19">and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him  to the nations to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify, and the  third day he will rise again.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_20" data-id="MT20_20">Then came near to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee,  with her sons, bowing and asking something from him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_21" data-id="MT20_21">and he said to her, `What wilt thou?' She saith to him,  `Say, that they may sit -- these my two sons -- one on thy  right hand, and one on the left, in thy reign.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_22" data-id="MT20_22">And Jesus answering said, `Ye have not known what ye ask  for yourselves; are ye able to drink of the cup that I am about  to drink? and with the baptism that I am baptized with, to be  baptized?' They say to him, `We are able.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_23" data-id="MT20_23">And he saith to them, `Of my cup indeed ye shall drink,  and with the baptism that I am baptized with ye shall be  baptized; but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not  mine to give, but -- to those for whom it hath been prepared by  my father.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_24" data-id="MT20_24">And the ten having heard, were much displeased with the  two brothers,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_25" data-id="MT20_25">and Jesus having called them near, said, `Ye have known  that the rulers of the nations do exercise lordship over them,  and those great do exercise authority over them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_26" data-id="MT20_26">but not so shall it be among you, but whoever may will  among you to become great, let him be your ministrant;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_27" data-id="MT20_27">and whoever may will among you to be first, let him be  your servant;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_28" data-id="MT20_28">even as the Son of Man did not come to be ministered to,  but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_29" data-id="MT20_29">And they going forth from Jericho, there followed him a  great multitude,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_30" data-id="MT20_30">and lo, two blind men sitting by the way, having heard  that Jesus doth pass by, cried, saying, `Deal kindly with us,  sir -- Son of David.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_31" data-id="MT20_31">And the multitude charged them that they might be silent,  and they cried out the more, saying, `Deal kindly with us sir  -- Son of David.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_32" data-id="MT20_32">And having stood, Jesus called them, and said, `What will  ye [that] I may do to you?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_33" data-id="MT20_33">they say to him, `Sir, that our eyes may be opened;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT20_34" data-id="MT20_34">and having been moved with compassion, Jesus touched their  eyes, and immediately their eyes received sight, and they  followed him.</span>
