<div class="c">2</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET2_1" data-id="ET2_1">After these things, at the ceasing of the fury of the king  Ahasuerus, he hath remembered Vashti, and that which she did,  and that which hath been decreed concerning her;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET2_2" data-id="ET2_2">and servants of the king, his ministers, say, `Let them seek  for the king young women, virgins, of good appearance,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET2_3" data-id="ET2_3">and the king doth appoint inspectors in all provinces of his  kingdom, and they gather every young woman -- virgin, of good  appearance -- unto Shushan the palace, unto the house of the  women, unto the hand of Hege eunuch of the king, keeper of the  women, and to give their purifications,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET2_4" data-id="ET2_4">and the young woman who is good in the eyes of the king doth  reign instead of Vashti;' and the thing is good in the eyes of  the king, and he doth so.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET2_5" data-id="ET2_5">A man, a Jew, there hath been in Shushan the palace, and his  name [is] Mordecai son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a  Benjamite --</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET2_6" data-id="ET2_6">who had been removed from Jerusalem with the removal that  was removed with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar  king of Babylon removed --</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET2_7" data-id="ET2_7">and he is supporting Hadassah -- she [is] Esther -- daughter  of his uncle, for she hath neither father nor mother, and the  young woman [is] of fair form, and of good appearance, and at  the death of her father and her mother hath Mordecai taken her  to him for a daughter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET2_8" data-id="ET2_8">And it cometh to pass, in the word of the king, even his  law, being heard, and in many young women being gathered unto  Shushan the palace, unto the hand of Hegai, that Esther is  taken unto the house of the king, unto the hand of Hegai,  keeper of the women,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET2_9" data-id="ET2_9">and the young woman is good in his eyes, and she receiveth  kindness before him, and he hasteneth her purifications and her  portions -- to give to her, and the seven young women who are  provided -- to give to her, from the house of the king, and he  changeth her and her young women to a good [place in] the house  of the women.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET2_10" data-id="ET2_10">Esther hath not declared her people, and her kindred, for  Mordecai hath laid a charge on her that she doth not declare  [it];</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET2_11" data-id="ET2_11">and during every day Mordecai is walking up and down before  the court of the house of the women to know the welfare of  Esther, and what is done with her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET2_12" data-id="ET2_12">And in the drawing nigh of the turn of each young woman to  come in unto the king Ahasuerus, at the end of there being to  her -- according to the law of the women -- twelve months, for  so they fulfil the days of their purifications; six months with  oil of myrrh, and six months with spices, and with the  purifications of women,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET2_13" data-id="ET2_13">and with this the young woman hath come in unto the king,  all that she saith is given to her, to go in with her, out of  the house of the women, unto the house of the king;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET2_14" data-id="ET2_14">in the evening she hath gone in, and in the morning she  hath turned back unto the second house of the women, unto the  hand of Shaashgaz eunuch of the king, keeper of the concubines;  she cometh not in any more unto the king except the king hath  delighted in her, and she hath been called by name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET2_15" data-id="ET2_15">And in the drawing nigh of the turn of Esther -- daughter  of Abihail, uncle of Mordecai, whom he had taken to him for a  daughter -- to come in unto the king, she hath not sought a  thing except that which Hegai eunuch of the king, keeper of the  women, saith, and Esther is receiving grace in the eyes of all  seeing her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET2_16" data-id="ET2_16">And Esther is taken unto the king Ahasuerus, unto his royal  house, in the tenth month -- it [is] the month of Tebeth -- in  the seventh year of his reign,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET2_17" data-id="ET2_17">and the king loveth Esther above all the women, and she  receiveth grace and kindness before him above all the virgins,  and he setteth a royal crown on her head, and causeth her to  reign instead of Vashti,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET2_18" data-id="ET2_18">and the king maketh a great banquet to all his heads and  his servants -- the banquet of Esther -- and a release to the  provinces hath made, and giveth gifts as a memorial of the  king.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET2_19" data-id="ET2_19">And in the virgins being gathered a second time, then  Mordecai is sitting in the gate of the king;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET2_20" data-id="ET2_20">Esther is not declaring her kindred and her people, as  Mordecai hath laid a charge upon her, and the saying of  Mordecai Esther is doing as when she was truly with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET2_21" data-id="ET2_21">In those days, when Mordecai is sitting in the gate of the  king, hath Bigthan been wroth, and Teresh, (two of the eunuchs  of the king, the keepers of the threshold,) and they seek to  put forth a hand on king Ahasuerus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET2_22" data-id="ET2_22">and the thing is known to Mordecai, and he declareth [it]  to Esther the queen, and Esther speaketh to the king in the  name of Mordecai,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET2_23" data-id="ET2_23">and the thing is sought out, and found, and they are hanged  both of them on a tree, and it is written in the book of the  Chronicles before the king.</span>
