<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_3" data-id="T21_3">I am thankful to God, whom I serve from progenitors in a  pure conscience, that unceasingly I have remembrance  concerning thee in my supplications night and day,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_4" data-id="T21_4">desiring greatly to see thee, being mindful of thy tears,  that with joy I may be filled,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_5" data-id="T21_5">taking remembrance of the unfeigned faith that is in thee,  that dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother  Eunice, and I am persuaded that also in thee.</span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_10" data-id="T21_10">and was made manifest now through the manifestation of our  Saviour Jesus Christ, who indeed did abolish death, and did  enlighten life and immortality through the good news,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_11" data-id="T21_11">to which I was placed a preacher and an apostle, and a  teacher of nations,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_12" data-id="T21_12">for which cause also these things I suffer, but I am not  ashamed, for I have known in whom I have believed, and have  been persuaded that he is able that which I have committed to  him to guard -- to that day.</span>
