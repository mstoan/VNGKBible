<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_2" data-id="PS73_2">As nothing, have my steps slipped, For I have been envious  of the boastful,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_3" data-id="PS73_3">The peace of the wicked I see, That there are no bands at  their death,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_4" data-id="PS73_4">And their might [is] firm.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_5" data-id="PS73_5">In the misery of mortals they are not, And with common men  they are not plagued.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_6" data-id="PS73_6">Therefore hath pride encircled them, Violence covereth them  as a dress.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_7" data-id="PS73_7">Their eye hath come out from fat. The imaginations of the  heart transgressed;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_8" data-id="PS73_8">They do corruptly, And they speak in the wickedness of  oppression, From on high they speak.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_9" data-id="PS73_9">They have set in the heavens their mouth, And their tongue  walketh in the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_10" data-id="PS73_10">Therefore do His people return hither, And waters of  fulness are wrung out to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_11" data-id="PS73_11">And they have said, `How hath God known? And is there  knowledge in the Most High?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_12" data-id="PS73_12">Lo, these [are] the wicked and easy ones of the age, They  have increased strength.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_13" data-id="PS73_13">Only -- a vain thing! I have purified my heart, And I wash  in innocency my hands,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_14" data-id="PS73_14">And I am plagued all the day, And my reproof [is] every  morning.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_15" data-id="PS73_15">If I have said, `I recount thus,' Lo, a generation of Thy  sons I have deceived.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_16" data-id="PS73_16">And I think to know this, Perverseness it [is] in mine  eyes,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_17" data-id="PS73_17">Till I come in to the sanctuaries of God, I attend to  their latter end.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_18" data-id="PS73_18">Only, in slippery places Thou dost set them, Thou hast  caused them to fall to desolations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_19" data-id="PS73_19">How have they become a desolation as in a moment, They  have been ended -- consumed from terrors.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_20" data-id="PS73_20">As a dream from awakening, O Lord, In awaking, their image  Thou despisest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_21" data-id="PS73_21">For my heart doth show itself violent, And my reins prick  themselves,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_22" data-id="PS73_22">And I am brutish, and do not know. A beast I have been  with Thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_23" data-id="PS73_23">And I [am] continually with Thee, Thou hast laid hold on  my right hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_24" data-id="PS73_24">With Thy counsel Thou dost lead me, And after honour dost  receive me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_25" data-id="PS73_25">Whom have I in the heavens? And with Thee none I have  desired in earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_26" data-id="PS73_26">Consumed hath been my flesh and my heart, The rock of my  heart and my portion [is] God to the age.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_27" data-id="PS73_27">For, lo, those far from Thee do perish, Thou hast cut off  every one, Who is going a whoring from Thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS73_28" data-id="PS73_28">And I -- nearness of God to me [is] good, I have placed in  the Lord Jehovah my refuge, To recount all Thy works!</span>
