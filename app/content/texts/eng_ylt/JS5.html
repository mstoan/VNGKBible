<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS5_2" data-id="JS5_2">At that time said Jehovah unto Joshua, `Make for thee knives  of flint, and turn back, circumcise the sons of Israel a second  time;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS5_3" data-id="JS5_3">and Joshua maketh for him knives of flint, and circumciseth  the sons of Israel at the height of the foreskins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS5_4" data-id="JS5_4">And this [is] the thing [for] which Joshua circumciseth  [them]: all the people who are coming out of Egypt, who are males,  all the men of war have died in the wilderness, in the way, in  their coming out of Egypt,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS5_5" data-id="JS5_5">for all the people who are coming out were circumcised, and  all the people who [are] born in the wilderness, in the way, in  their coming out from Egypt, they have not circumcised;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS5_6" data-id="JS5_6">for forty years have the sons of Israel gone in the  wilderness, till all the nation of the men of war who are  coming out of Egypt, who hearkened not to the voice of Jehovah,  to whom Jehovah hath sworn not to show them the land which  Jehovah sware to their fathers to give to us, a land flowing  with milk and honey, are consumed;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS5_7" data-id="JS5_7">and their sons He raised up in their stead, them hath Joshua  circumcised, for they have been uncircumcised, for they have  not circumcised them in the way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS5_8" data-id="JS5_8">And it cometh to pass when all the nation have completed to  be circumcised, that they abide in their places in the camp  till their recovering;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS5_9" data-id="JS5_9">and Jehovah saith unto Joshua, `To-day I have rolled the  reproach of Egypt from off you;' and [one] calleth the name of  that place Gilgal unto this day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS5_10" data-id="JS5_10">And the sons of Israel encamp in Gilgal, and make the  passover on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, in the  plains of Jericho;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS5_11" data-id="JS5_11">and they eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow of  the passover, unleavened things and roasted [corn], in this  self-same day;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS5_12" data-id="JS5_12">and the manna doth cease on the morrow in their eating of  the old corn of the land, and there hath been no more manna to  the sons of Israel, and they eat of the increase of the land of  Canaan in that year.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS5_13" data-id="JS5_13">And it cometh to pass in Joshua's being by Jericho, that he  lifteth up his eyes, and looketh, and lo, one standing  over-against him, and his drawn sword in his hand, and Joshua  goeth unto him, and saith to him, `Art thou for us or for our  adversaries?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS5_14" data-id="JS5_14">And He saith, `No, for I [am] Prince of Jehovah's host; now  I have come;' and Joshua falleth on his face to the earth, and  doth obeisance, and saith to Him, `What is my Lord speaking  unto His servant?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS5_15" data-id="JS5_15">And the Prince of Jehovah's host saith unto Joshua, `Cast  off thy shoe from off thy foot, for the place on which thou art  standing is holy;' and Joshua doth so;</span>
