<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C116_2" data-id="C116_2">on every first [day] of the week, let each one of you lay  by him, treasuring up whatever he may have prospered, that when  I may come then collections may not be made;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C116_3" data-id="C116_3">and whenever I may come, whomsoever ye may approve, through  letters, these I will send to carry your favour to Jerusalem;</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C116_16" data-id="C116_16">that ye also be subject to such, and to every one who is  working with [us] and labouring;</span>
