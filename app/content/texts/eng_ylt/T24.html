<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_2" data-id="T24_2">preach the word; be earnest in season, out of season,  convict, rebuke, exhort, in all long-suffering and teaching,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_3" data-id="T24_3">for there shall be a season when the sound teaching they  will not suffer, but according to their own desires to  themselves they shall heap up teachers -- itching in the  hearing,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_4" data-id="T24_4">and indeed, from the truth the hearing they shall turn away,  and to the fables they shall be turned aside.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_5" data-id="T24_5">And thou -- watch in all things; suffer evil; do the work of  one proclaiming good news; of thy ministration make full  assurance,</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_7" data-id="T24_7">the good strife I have striven, the course I have finished,  the faith I have kept,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_8" data-id="T24_8">henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of the  righteousness that the Lord -- the Righteous Judge -- shall  give to me in that day, and not only to me, but also to all  those loving his manifestation.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_11" data-id="T24_11">Lukas only is with me; Markus having taken, bring with  thyself, for he is profitable to me for ministration;</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_17" data-id="T24_17">and the Lord stood by me, and did strengthen me, that  through me the preaching might be fully assured, and all the  nations might hear, and I was freed out of the mouth of a lion,</span>
