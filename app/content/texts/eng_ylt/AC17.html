<div class="c">17</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_1" data-id="AC17_1">And having passed through Amphipolis, and Apollonia, they  came to Thessalonica, where was the synagogue of the Jews,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_2" data-id="AC17_2">and according to the custom of Paul, he went in unto them,  and for three sabbaths he was reasoning with them from the  Writings,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_3" data-id="AC17_3">opening and alleging, `That the Christ it behoved to  suffer, and to rise again out of the dead, and that this is  the Christ -- Jesus whom I proclaim to you.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_4" data-id="AC17_4">And certain of them did believe, and attached themselves to  Paul and to Silas, also of the worshipping Greeks a great  multitude, of the principal women also not a few.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_5" data-id="AC17_5">And the unbelieving Jews, having been moved with envy, and  having taken to them of the loungers certain evil men, and  having made a crowd, were setting the city in an uproar; having  assailed also the house of Jason, they were seeking them to  bring [them] to the populace,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_6" data-id="AC17_6">and not having found them, they drew Jason and certain  brethren unto the city rulers, calling aloud -- `These, having  put the world in commotion, are also here present,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_7" data-id="AC17_7">whom Jason hath received; and these all do contrary to the  decrees of Caesar, saying another to be king -- Jesus.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_8" data-id="AC17_8">And they troubled the multitude and the city rulers,  hearing these things,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_9" data-id="AC17_9">and having taking security from Jason and the rest, they  let them go.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_10" data-id="AC17_10">And the brethren immediately, through the night, sent  forth both Paul and Silas to Berea, who having come, went to  the synagogue of the Jews;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_11" data-id="AC17_11">and these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, they  received the word with all readiness of mind, every day  examining the Writings whether those things were so;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_12" data-id="AC17_12">many, indeed, therefore, of them did believe, and of the  honourable Greek women and men not a few.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_13" data-id="AC17_13">And when the Jews from Thessalonica knew that also in  Berea was the word of God declared by Paul, they came thither  also, agitating the multitudes;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_14" data-id="AC17_14">and then immediately the brethren sent forth Paul, to go  on as it were to the sea, but both Silas and Timothy were  remaining there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_15" data-id="AC17_15">And those conducting Paul, brought him unto Athens, and  having received a command unto Silas and Timotheus that with  all speed they may come unto him, they departed;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_16" data-id="AC17_16">and Paul waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was  stirred in him, beholding the city wholly given to idolatry,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_17" data-id="AC17_17">therefore, indeed, he was reasoning in the synagogue with  the Jews, and with the worshipping persons, and in the  market-place every day with those who met with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_18" data-id="AC17_18">And certain of the Epicurean and of the Stoic  philosophers, were meeting together to see him, and some were  saying, `What would this seed picker wish to say?' and others,  `Of strange demons he doth seem to be an announcer;' because  Jesus and the rising again he did proclaim to them as good  news,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_19" data-id="AC17_19">having also taken him, unto the Areopagus they brought  [him], saying, `Are we able to know what [is] this new teaching  that is spoken by thee,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_20" data-id="AC17_20">for certain strange things thou dost bring to our ears? we  wish, then, to know what these things would wish to be;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_21" data-id="AC17_21">and all Athenians, and the strangers sojourning, for  nothing else were at leisure but to say something, and to hear  some newer thing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_22" data-id="AC17_22">And Paul, having stood in the midst of the Areopagus,  said, `Men, Athenians, in all things I perceive you as  over-religious;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_23" data-id="AC17_23">for passing through and contemplating your objects of  worship, I found also an erection on which had been inscribed:  To God -- unknown; whom, therefore -- not knowing -- ye do  worship, this One I announce to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_24" data-id="AC17_24">`God, who did make the world, and all things in it, this  One, of heaven and of earth being Lord, in temples made with  hands doth not dwell,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_25" data-id="AC17_25">neither by the hands of men is He served -- needing  anything, He giving to all life, and breath, and all things;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_26" data-id="AC17_26">He made also of one blood every nation of men, to dwell  upon all the face of the earth -- having ordained times before  appointed, and the bounds of their dwellings --</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_27" data-id="AC17_27">to seek the Lord, if perhaps they did feel after Him and  find, -- though, indeed, He is not far from each one of us,</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_28" data-id="AC17_28">for in Him we live, and move, and are; as also certain of  your poets have said: For of Him also we are offspring.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_29" data-id="AC17_29">`Being, therefore, offspring of God, we ought not to think  the Godhead to be like to gold, or silver, or stone, graving of  art and device of man;</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_30" data-id="AC17_30">the times, indeed, therefore, of the ignorance God having  overlooked, doth now command all men everywhere to reform,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_31" data-id="AC17_31">because He did set a day in which He is about to judge the  world in righteousness, by a man whom He did ordain, having  given assurance to all, having raised him out of the dead.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_32" data-id="AC17_32">And having heard of a rising again of the dead, some,  indeed, were mocking, but others said, `We will hear thee again  concerning this;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_33" data-id="AC17_33">and so Paul went forth from the midst of them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_34" data-id="AC17_34">and certain men having cleaved to him, did believe, among  whom [is] also Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman, by name  Damaris, and others with them.</span>
