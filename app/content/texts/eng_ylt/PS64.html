<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS64_2" data-id="PS64_2">Hidest me from the secret counsel of evil doers, From the  tumult of workers of iniquity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS64_3" data-id="PS64_3">Who sharpened as a sword their tongue, They directed their  arrow -- a bitter word.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS64_4" data-id="PS64_4">To shoot in secret places the perfect, Suddenly they shoot  him, and fear not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS64_5" data-id="PS64_5">They strengthen for themselves an evil thing, They recount  of the hiding of snares, They have said, `Who doth look at it?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS64_6" data-id="PS64_6">They search out perverse things, `We perfected a searching  search,' And the inward part of man, and the heart [are] deep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS64_7" data-id="PS64_7">And God doth shoot them [with] an arrow, Sudden have been  their wounds,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS64_8" data-id="PS64_8">And they cause him to stumble, Against them [is] their own  tongue, Every looker on them fleeth away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS64_9" data-id="PS64_9">And all men fear, and declare the work of God, And His deed  they have considered wisely.</span>
