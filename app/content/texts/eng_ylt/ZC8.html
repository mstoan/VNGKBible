<div class="c">8</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC8_1" data-id="ZC8_1">And there is a word of Jehovah of Hosts, saying:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC8_2" data-id="ZC8_2">`Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: I have been zealous for Zion  with great zeal, With great heat I have been zealous for her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC8_3" data-id="ZC8_3">Thus said Jehovah: I have turned back unto Zion, And I have  dwelt in the midst of Jerusalem, And Jerusalem hath been called  `The city of truth,' And the mountain of Jehovah of Hosts, `The  holy mountain.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC8_4" data-id="ZC8_4">Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Again dwell do old men and old  women, In broad places of Jerusalem, And each his staff in his  hand, Because of abundance of days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC8_5" data-id="ZC8_5">And broad places of the city are full of boys and girls,  Playing in its broad places.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC8_6" data-id="ZC8_6">Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Surely it is wonderful in the  eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, Also in Mine  eyes it is wonderful, An affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC8_7" data-id="ZC8_7">Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Lo, I am saving My people from  the land of the rising, And from the land of the going in, of  the sun,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC8_8" data-id="ZC8_8">And I have brought them in, They have dwelt in the midst of  Jerusalem, And they have been to Me for a people, And I am to  them for God, In truth and in righteousness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC8_9" data-id="ZC8_9">Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Let your hands be strong, Ye who  are hearing in these days these words from the mouth of the  prophets, That in the day the house of Jehovah of Hosts Hath  been founded, the temple [is] to be built.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC8_10" data-id="ZC8_10">For, before those days there hath been no hiring of man,  Yea, a hiring of beasts there is none; And to him who is going  out, And to him who is coming in, There is no peace because of  the adversary, And I send all men -- each against his  neighbour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC8_11" data-id="ZC8_11">And now, not as [in] the former days [am] I to the remnant  of this people, An affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC8_12" data-id="ZC8_12">Because of the sowing of peace, The vine doth give her  fruit, And the earth doth give her increase, And the heavens do  give their dew, And I have caused the remnant of this people To  inherit all these.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC8_13" data-id="ZC8_13">And it hath come to pass, As ye have been a reviling among  nations, O house of Judah, and house of Israel, So I save you,  and ye have been a blessing, Do not fear, let your hands be  strong.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC8_14" data-id="ZC8_14">For, thus said Jehovah of Hosts, As I did purpose to do  evil to you, When your fathers made Me wroth, Said Jehovah of  Hosts, and I did not repent,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC8_15" data-id="ZC8_15">So I have turned back, I have purposed, in these days, To  do good with Jerusalem, And with the house of Judah -- fear  not!</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC8_16" data-id="ZC8_16">These [are] the things that ye do: Speak ye truth each with  his neighbour, Truth and peaceful judgment judge in your gates,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC8_17" data-id="ZC8_17">And each the evil of his neighbour ye do not devise in your  heart, And a false oath ye do not love, For all these [are]  things that I have hated, An affirmation of Jehovah.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC8_18" data-id="ZC8_18">And there is a word of Jehovah of Hosts unto me, saying:</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC8_19" data-id="ZC8_19">`Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: The fast of the fourth, and  the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the  fast of the tenth [months], are to the house of Judah for joy  and for rejoicing, and for pleasant appointed seasons, and the  truth and the peace they have loved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC8_20" data-id="ZC8_20">Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Yet come do peoples, and  inhabitants of many cities,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC8_21" data-id="ZC8_21">Yea, gone have inhabitants of one To another, saying: We go  diligently, To appease the face of Jehovah, To seek Jehovah of  Hosts -- I go, even I.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC8_22" data-id="ZC8_22">Yea, come in have many peoples, and mighty nations, To seek  Jehovah of Hosts in Jerusalem, And to appease the face of  Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC8_23" data-id="ZC8_23">Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: In those days take hold do ten  men of all languages of the nations, Yea, they have taken hold  on the skirt of a man, a Jew, saying: We go with you, for we  heard God [is] with you!</span>
