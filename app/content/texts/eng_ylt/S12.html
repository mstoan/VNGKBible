<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_3" data-id="S12_3">Ye multiply not -- ye speak haughtily -- The old saying goeth  out from your mouth, For a God of knowledge [is] Jehovah, And  by Him actions are weighed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_4" data-id="S12_4">Bows of the mighty are broken, And the stumbling have girded  on strength.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_5" data-id="S12_5">The satiated for bread hired themselves, And the hungry have  ceased. While the barren hath borne seven, And she abounding  with sons hath languished.</span>

<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_26" data-id="S12_26">And the youth Samuel is going on and growing up, and [is]  good both with Jehovah, and also with men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_27" data-id="S12_27">And there cometh a man of God unto Eli, and saith unto him,  `Thus said Jehovah, Was I really revealed unto the house of thy  father in their being in Egypt, before Pharaoh's house,</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_28" data-id="S12_28">even to choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to Me  for a priest, to go up on Mine altar, to make a perfume, to  bear an ephod before Me, and I give to the house of thy father  all the fire-offerings of the sons of Israel?</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_29" data-id="S12_29">Why do ye kick at My sacrifice, and at Mine offering which  I commanded [in] My habitation, and dost honour thy sons above  Me, to make yourselves fat from the first part of every  offering of Israel, of My people?</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_30" data-id="S12_30">`Therefore -- the affirmation of Jehovah, God of Israel -- I  certainly said, Thy house and the house of thy father, do walk  up and down before Me to the age; and now -- the affirmation of  Jehovah -- Far be it from Me! for he who is honouring Me, I  honour, and those despising Me, are lightly esteemed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_31" data-id="S12_31">`Lo, days [are] coming, and I have cut off thine arm, and  the arm of the house of thy father, that an old man is not in  thy house;</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_32" data-id="S12_32">and thou hast beheld an adversary [in My] habitation, in  all that He doth good with Israel, and there is not an old man  in thy house all the days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_33" data-id="S12_33">`And the man I cut not off of thine from Mine altar, [is]  to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thy soul; and all the  increase of thy house do die men;</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_34" data-id="S12_34">and this [is] to thee the sign that cometh unto thy two  sons, unto Hophni and Phinehas -- in one day they die both of  them;</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_35" data-id="S12_35">and I have raised up for Me a stedfast priest; as in My  heart and in My soul he doth do; and I have built for him a  stedfast house, and he hath walked up and down before Mine  anointed all the days;</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_36" data-id="S12_36">and it hath been, every one who is left in thy house doth  come in to bow himself to him, for a wage of silver, and a cake  of bread, and hath said, Admit me, I pray thee, unto one of the  priest's offices, to eat a morsel of bread.'</span>
