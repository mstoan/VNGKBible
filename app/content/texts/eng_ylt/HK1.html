<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_2" data-id="HK1_2">Till when, O Jehovah, have I cried, And Thou dost not hear?  I cry unto Thee -- `Violence,' and Thou dost not save.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_3" data-id="HK1_3">Why dost Thou shew me iniquity, And perversity dost cause to  behold? And spoiling and violence [are] before me, And there is  strife, and contention doth lift [itself] up,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_4" data-id="HK1_4">Therefore doth law cease, And judgment doth not go forth for  ever, For the wicked is compassing the righteous, Therefore  wrong judgment goeth forth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_5" data-id="HK1_5">Look ye on nations, and behold and marvel greatly. For a  work He is working in your days, Ye do not believe though it is  declared.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_6" data-id="HK1_6">For, lo, I am raising up the Chaldeans, The bitter and hasty  nation, That is going to the broad places of earth, To occupy  tabernacles not its own.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_7" data-id="HK1_7">Terrible and fearful it [is], From itself its judgment and  its excellency go forth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_8" data-id="HK1_8">Swifter than leopards have been its horses, And sharper than  evening wolves, And increased have its horsemen, Even its  horsemen from afar come in, They fly as an eagle, hasting to  consume.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_9" data-id="HK1_9">Wholly for violence it doth come in, Their faces swallowing  up the east wind, And it doth gather as the sand a captivity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_10" data-id="HK1_10">And at kings it doth scoff, And princes [are] a laughter to  it, At every fenced place it doth laugh, And it heapeth up  dust, and captureth it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_11" data-id="HK1_11">Then passed on hath the spirit, Yea, he doth transgress,  And doth ascribe this his power to his god.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_12" data-id="HK1_12">Art not Thou of old, O Jehovah, my God, my Holy One? We do  not die, O Jehovah, For judgment Thou hast appointed it, And,  O Rock, for reproof Thou hast founded it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_13" data-id="HK1_13">Purer of eyes than to behold evil, To look on perverseness  Thou art not able, Why dost Thou behold the treacherous? Thou  keepest silent when the wicked Doth swallow the more righteous  than he,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_14" data-id="HK1_14">And Thou makest man as fishes of the sea, As a creeping  thing -- none ruling over him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_15" data-id="HK1_15">Each of them with a hook he hath brought up, He doth catch  it in his net, and gathereth it in his drag, Therefore he doth  joy and rejoice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_16" data-id="HK1_16">Therefore he doth sacrifice to his net, And doth make  perfume to his drag, For by them [is] his portion fertile, and  his food fat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK1_17" data-id="HK1_17">Doth he therefore empty his net, And continually to slay  nations spare not?</span>
