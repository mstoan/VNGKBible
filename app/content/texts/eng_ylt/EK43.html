<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_2" data-id="EK43_2">And lo, the honour of the God of Israel hath come from the  way of the east, and His voice [is] as the noise of many  waters, and the earth hath shone from His honour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_3" data-id="EK43_3">And according to the appearance [is] the appearance that I  saw, as the appearance that I saw in my coming in to destroy  the city, and the appearances [are] as the appearance that I  saw at the river Chebar, and I fall on my face.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_4" data-id="EK43_4">And the honour of Jehovah hath come in unto the house, the  way of the gate whose face [is] eastward.</span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_8" data-id="EK43_8">In their putting their threshold with My threshold, And  their door-post near My door-post, And the wall between Me and  them, And they have defiled My holy name, By their abominations  that they have done, And I consume them in Mine anger.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_9" data-id="EK43_9">Now do they put far off their whoredom, And the carcases of  their kings -- from Me, And I have dwelt in their midst to the  age.</span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_18" data-id="EK43_18">And He saith unto me, `Son of man, Thus said the Lord  Jehovah: These [are] statutes of the altar in the day of its  being made to cause burnt-offering to go up on it, and to  sprinkle on it blood.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_19" data-id="EK43_19">And thou hast given unto the priests, the Levites, who  [are] of the seed of Zadok -- who are near unto Me, an  affirmation of the Lord Jehovah, to serve Me -- a calf from the  herd, for a sin-offering.</span>

<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_24" data-id="EK43_24">And thou hast brought them near before Jehovah, and the  priests have cast upon them salt, and have caused them to go  up, a burnt-offering to Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_25" data-id="EK43_25">Seven days thou dost prepare a goat for a sin-offering  daily, and a bullock, a son of the herd, and a ram out of the  flock, perfect ones, do they prepare.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_26" data-id="EK43_26">Seven days they purify the altar, and have cleansed it,  and filled their hand.</span>
