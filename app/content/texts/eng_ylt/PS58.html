<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS58_2" data-id="PS58_2">Even in heart ye work iniquities, In the land the violence  of your hands ye ponder.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS58_3" data-id="PS58_3">The wicked have been estranged from the womb, They have  erred from the belly, speaking lies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS58_4" data-id="PS58_4">Their poison [is] as poison of a serpent, As a deaf asp  shutting its ear,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS58_5" data-id="PS58_5">Which hearkeneth not to the voice of whisperers, A charmer  of charms most skilful.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS58_6" data-id="PS58_6">O God, break their teeth in their mouth, The jaw-teeth of  young lions break down, O Jehovah.</span>
