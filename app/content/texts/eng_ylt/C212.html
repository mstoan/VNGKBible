<div class="c">12</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_1" data-id="C212_1">To boast, really, is not profitable for me, for I will come  to visions and revelations of the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_2" data-id="C212_2">I have known a man in Christ, fourteen years ago -- whether  in the body I have not known, whether out of the body I have  not known, God hath known -- such an one being caught away unto  the third heaven;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_3" data-id="C212_3">and I have known such a man -- whether in the body, whether  out of the body, I have not known, God hath known, --</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_4" data-id="C212_4">that he was caught away to the paradise, and heard  unutterable sayings, that it is not possible for man to speak.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_5" data-id="C212_5">Of such an one I will boast, and of myself I will not  boast, except in my infirmities,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_6" data-id="C212_6">for if I may wish to boast, I shall not be a fool, for  truth I will say; but I forebear, lest any one in regard to me  may think anything above what he doth see me, or doth hear  anything of me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_7" data-id="C212_7">and that by the exceeding greatness of the revelations I  might not be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a thorn in  the flesh, a messenger of the Adversary, that he might buffet  me, that I might not be exalted overmuch.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_8" data-id="C212_8">Concerning this thing thrice the Lord did I call upon, that  it might depart from me,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_9" data-id="C212_9">and He said to me, `Sufficient for thee is My grace, for My  power in infirmity is perfected;' most gladly, therefore, will  I rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of the Christ  may rest on me:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_10" data-id="C212_10">wherefore I am well pleased in infirmities, in damages, in  necessities, in persecutions, in distresses -- for Christ; for  whenever I am infirm, then I am powerful;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_11" data-id="C212_11">I have become a fool -- boasting; ye -- ye did compel me;  for I ought by you to have been commended, for in nothing was I  behind the very chiefest apostles -- even if I am nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_12" data-id="C212_12">The signs, indeed, of the apostle were wrought among you  in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_13" data-id="C212_13">for what is there in which ye were inferior to the rest of  the assemblies, except that I myself was not a burden to you?  forgive me this injustice!</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_14" data-id="C212_14">Lo, a third time I am ready to come unto you, and I will  not be a burden to you, for I seek not yours, but you, for the  children ought not for the parents to lay up, but the parents  for the children,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_15" data-id="C212_15">and I most gladly will spend and be entirely spent for  your souls, even if, more abundantly loving you, less I am  loved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_16" data-id="C212_16">And be it [so], I -- I did not burden you, but being  crafty, with guile I did take you;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_17" data-id="C212_17">any one of those whom I have sent unto you -- by him did I  take advantage of you?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_18" data-id="C212_18">I entreated Titus, and did send with [him] the brother;  did Titus take advantage of you? in the same spirit did we not  walk? -- did we not in the same steps?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_19" data-id="C212_19">Again, think ye that to you we are making defence? before  God in Christ do we speak; and the all things, beloved, [are]  for your up-building,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_20" data-id="C212_20">for I fear lest, having come, not such as I wish I may  find you, and I -- I may be found by you such as ye do not  wish, lest there be strifes, envyings, wraths, revelries,  evil-speakings, whisperings, puffings up, insurrections,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_21" data-id="C212_21">lest again having come, my God may humble me in regard to  you, and I may bewail many of those having sinned before, and  not having reformed concerning the uncleanness, and whoredom,  and lasciviousness, that they did practise.</span>
