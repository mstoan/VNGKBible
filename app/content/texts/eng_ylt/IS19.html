Lo, Jehovah is riding on a swift thick  cloud, And He hath entered Egypt, And moved have been the idols  of Egypt at His presence, And the heart of Egypt melteth in its  midst.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS19_2" data-id="IS19_2">And I armed Egyptians against Egyptians, And they fought,  each against his brother, And each against his neighbour, City  against city, kingdom against kingdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS19_3" data-id="IS19_3">And emptied out hath been in its midst the spirit of Egypt.  And its counsel I swallow up, And they have sought unto the  idols, And unto the charmers, And unto those having familiar  spirits, And unto the wizards.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS19_4" data-id="IS19_4">And I have delivered the Egyptians Into the hand of a hard  lord, And a strong king doth rule over them, An affirmation of  the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS19_5" data-id="IS19_5">And failed have waters from the sea, And a river is wasted  and dried up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS19_6" data-id="IS19_6">And they have turned away the flowings, Weak and dried up  have been brooks of the bulwark, Reed and flag have withered.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS19_7" data-id="IS19_7">Exposed things by the brook, by the edge of the brook, And  every sown thing of the brook, hath withered, It hath been  driven away, and is not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS19_8" data-id="IS19_8">And lamented have the fishers, And mourned have all casting  angle into a brook, And those spreading nets on the face of the  waters have languished.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS19_9" data-id="IS19_9">And ashamed have been makers of fine flax, And weavers of  net-works.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS19_10" data-id="IS19_10">And its foundations have been smitten, All making wages  [are] afflicted in soul.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS19_11" data-id="IS19_11">Only, fools [are] the princes of Zoan, The counsel of the  wise ones of the counsellors of Pharaoh hath become brutish.  How say ye unto Pharaoh, `A son of the wise am I, a son of  kings of antiquity?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS19_12" data-id="IS19_12">Where [are] they now, thy wise ones? Yea, let them tell to  thee, I pray thee, And they know what Jehovah of Hosts hath  counselled against Egypt!</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS19_13" data-id="IS19_13">Foolish have been princes of Zoan, Lifted up have been  princes of Noph, And they have caused Egypt to err, The chief  of her tribes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS19_14" data-id="IS19_14">Jehovah hath mingled in her midst A spirit of  perverseness, And they have caused Egypt to err in all its  work, As a drunkard erreth in his vomit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS19_15" data-id="IS19_15">And there is no work to Egypt, That head or tail, branch  or reed, may do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS19_16" data-id="IS19_16">In that day is Egypt like women, And it hath mourned, and  been afraid, Because of the waving of the hand of Jehovah of  Hosts, That He is waving over it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS19_17" data-id="IS19_17">And the land of Judah hath been to Egypt for a cause of  staggering, Every one who doth mention it, for himself feareth,  Because of the counsel of Jehovah of Hosts, That He is  counselling against it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS19_18" data-id="IS19_18">In that day there are five cities in the land of Egypt,  Speaking the lip of Canaan, And swearing to Jehovah of Hosts,  `The city of destruction,' is said of one.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS19_19" data-id="IS19_19">In that day there is an altar to Jehovah In the midst of  the land of Egypt, And a standing pillar near its border to  Jehovah,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS19_20" data-id="IS19_20">And it hath been for a sign and for a testimony, To  Jehovah of Hosts in the land of Egypt, For they cry unto  Jehovah from the face of oppressors, And He sendeth to them a  saviour, Even a great one, and hath delivered them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS19_21" data-id="IS19_21">And known hath been Jehovah to Egypt, And the Egyptians  have known Jehovah in that day, And done sacrifice and present,  And vowed a vow to Jehovah, and completed [it].</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS19_22" data-id="IS19_22">And Jehovah hath smitten Egypt, smiting and healing, And  they have turned back unto Jehovah, And He hath been entreated  of them, And hath healed them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS19_23" data-id="IS19_23">In that day is a highway out of Egypt to Asshur, And come  in have the Assyrians to Egypt, And the Egyptians into Asshur,  And the Egyptians have served with the Assyrians.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS19_24" data-id="IS19_24">In that day is Israel third, After Egypt, and after  Asshur, A blessing in the heart of the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS19_25" data-id="IS19_25">In that Jehovah of Hosts did bless it, saying, `Blessed  [is] My people -- Egypt, And the work of My hands -- Asshur,  And Mine inheritance -- Israel!'</span>
