<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB15_3" data-id="JB15_3">To reason with a word not useful? And speeches -- no profit  in them?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB15_4" data-id="JB15_4">Yea, thou dost make reverence void, And dost diminish  meditation before God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB15_5" data-id="JB15_5">For thy mouth teacheth thine iniquity, And thou chooseth  the tongue of the subtile.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB15_6" data-id="JB15_6">Thy mouth declareth thee wicked, and not I, And thy lips  testify against thee.</span>

<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB15_33" data-id="JB15_33">He shaketh off as a vine his unripe fruit, And casteth off  as an olive his blossom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB15_34" data-id="JB15_34">For the company of the profane [is] gloomy, And fire hath  consumed tents of bribery.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB15_35" data-id="JB15_35">To conceive misery, and to bear iniquity, Even their heart  doth prepare deceit.</span>
