<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS10_3" data-id="PS10_3">Because the wicked hath boasted Of the desire of his soul,  And a dishonest gainer he hath blessed, He hath despised  Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS10_4" data-id="PS10_4">The wicked according to the height of his face, inquireth  not. `God is not!' [are] all his devices.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS10_5" data-id="PS10_5">Pain do his ways at all times, On high [are] Thy judgments  before him, All his adversaries -- he puffeth at them.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS10_7" data-id="PS10_7">Of oaths his mouth is full, And deceits, and fraud: Under  his tongue [is] perverseness and iniquity,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS10_8" data-id="PS10_8">He doth sit in an ambush of the villages, In secret places  he doth slay the innocent. His eyes for the afflicted watch  secretly,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS10_9" data-id="PS10_9">He lieth in wait in a secret place, as a lion in a covert.  He lieth in wait to catch the poor, He catcheth the poor,  drawing him into his net.</span>
