<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_2" data-id="EK47_2">And he causeth me to go out the way of the gate northward,  and causeth me to turn round the way without, unto the gate  that [is] without, the way that is looking eastward, and lo,  water is coming forth from the right side.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_3" data-id="EK47_3">In the going out of the man eastward, and a line in his  hand, then he measureth a thousand by the cubit, and he causeth  me to pass over into water -- water to the ankles.</span>

<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_5" data-id="EK47_5">And he measureth a thousand -- a stream that I am not able  to pass over; for risen have the waters -- waters to swim in --  a stream that is not passed over.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK47_6" data-id="EK47_6">And he saith unto me, `Hast thou seen, son of man?' and he  leadeth me, and bringeth me back unto the edge of the stream.</span>
