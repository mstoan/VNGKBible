<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM6_2" data-id="AM6_2">Pass ye over [to] Calneh and see, And go thence [to] Hamath  the great, And go down [to] Gath of the Philistines, Are [they]  better than these kingdoms? Greater [is] their border than your  border?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM6_3" data-id="AM6_3">Who are putting away the day of evil, And ye bring nigh the  seat of violence,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM6_4" data-id="AM6_4">Who are lying down on beds of ivory, And are spread out on  their couches, And are eating lambs from the flock, And calves  from the midst of the stall,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM6_5" data-id="AM6_5">Who are taking part according to the psaltery, Like David  they invented for themselves instruments of music;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM6_6" data-id="AM6_6">Who are drinking with bowls of wine, And [with] chief  perfumes anoint [themselves], And have not been pained for the  breach of Joseph.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM6_7" data-id="AM6_7">Therefore now they remove at the head of the captives, And  turned aside is the mourning-feast of stretched-out ones.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM6_8" data-id="AM6_8">Sworn hath the Lord Jehovah by Himself, An affirmation of  Jehovah, God of Hosts: I am abominating the excellency of  Jacob, And his high places I have hated, And I have delivered  up the city and its fulness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM6_9" data-id="AM6_9">And if there are left ten persons in one house, It hath come  to pass -- that they have died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM6_10" data-id="AM6_10">And lifted him up hath his loved one, even his burner, To  bring forth the bones from the house, And he said to him who  [is] in the sides of the house, `Is there yet with thee?' And  he said, `None,' then he said, `Hush! Save to make mention of  the name of Jehovah.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM6_11" data-id="AM6_11">For lo, Jehovah is commanding, And He hath smitten the  great house [with] breaches, And the little house [with]  clefts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM6_12" data-id="AM6_12">Do horses run on a rock? Doth one plough [it] with oxen?  For ye have turned to gall judgment, And the fruit of  righteousness to wormwood.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM6_13" data-id="AM6_13">O ye who are rejoicing at nothing, Who are saying, `Have we  not by our strength taken to ourselves horns?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM6_14" data-id="AM6_14">Surely, lo, I am raising against you a nation, O house of  Israel, An affirmation of Jehovah, God of Hosts, And they have  oppressed you from the coming in to Hamath, Unto the stream of  the desert.</span>
