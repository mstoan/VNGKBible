<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC13_2" data-id="ZC13_2">And it hath come to pass, in that day, An affirmation of  Jehovah of Hosts, I cut off the names of the idols from the  land, And they are not remembered any more, And also the  prophets and the spirit of uncleanness I cause to pass away  from the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC13_3" data-id="ZC13_3">And it hath been, when one prophesieth again, That said  unto him have his father and his mother, his parents, `Thou  dost not live, For falsehood thou hast spoken in the name of  Jehovah,' And pierced him through have his father and his  mother, his parents, in his prophesying.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC13_4" data-id="ZC13_4">And it hath come to pass, in that day, Ashamed are the  prophets, each of his vision, in his prophesying, And they put  not on a hairy robe to deceive.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC13_5" data-id="ZC13_5">And [one] hath said, `I am not a prophet, A man, a tiller  of ground I am, For ground [is] my possession from my youth.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC13_6" data-id="ZC13_6">And [one] hath said unto him, `What [are] these wounds in  thy hands?' And he hath said, `Because I was smitten [at] home  by my lovers.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC13_7" data-id="ZC13_7">Sword, awake against My shepherd, And against a hero -- My  fellow, An affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts. Smite the shepherd,  and scattered is the flock, And I have put back My hand on the  little ones.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC13_8" data-id="ZC13_8">And it hath come to pass, In all the land, an affirmation  of Jehovah, Two parts in it are cut off -- they expire, And the  third is left in it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC13_9" data-id="ZC13_9">And I have brought the third into fire, And refined them  like a refining of silver, And have tried them like a trying of  gold, It doth call in My name, and I answer it, I have said,  `My people it [is],' And it saith, `Jehovah [is] my God!'</span>
