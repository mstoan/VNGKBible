<div class="c">2</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_1" data-id="JM2_1">My brethren, hold not, in respect of persons, the faith of  the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_2" data-id="JM2_2">for if there may come into your synagogue a man with gold  ring, in gay raiment, and there may come in also a poor man in  vile raiment,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_3" data-id="JM2_3">and ye may look upon him bearing the gay raiment, and may  say to him, `Thou -- sit thou here well,' and to the poor man  may say, `Thou -- stand thou there, or, Sit thou here under my  footstool,' --</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_4" data-id="JM2_4">ye did not judge fully in yourselves, and did become  ill-reasoning judges.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_5" data-id="JM2_5">Hearken, my brethren beloved, did not God choose the poor of  this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the reign that He  promised to those loving Him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_6" data-id="JM2_6">and ye did dishonour the poor one; do not the rich oppress  you and themselves draw you to judgment-seats;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_7" data-id="JM2_7">do they not themselves speak evil of the good name that was  called upon you?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_8" data-id="JM2_8">If, indeed, royal law ye complete, according to the Writing,  `Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,' -- ye do well;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_9" data-id="JM2_9">and if ye accept persons, sin ye do work, being convicted by  the law as transgressors;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_10" data-id="JM2_10">for whoever the whole law shall keep, and shall stumble in  one [point], he hath become guilty of all;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_11" data-id="JM2_11">for He who is saying, `Thou mayest not commit adultery,'  said also, `Thou mayest do no murder;' and if thou shalt not  commit adultery, and shalt commit murder, thou hast become a  transgressor of law;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_12" data-id="JM2_12">so speak ye and so do, as about by a law of liberty to be  judged,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_13" data-id="JM2_13">for the judgment without kindness [is] to him not having  done kindness, and exult doth kindness over judgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_14" data-id="JM2_14">What [is] the profit, my brethren, if faith, any one may  speak of having, and works he may not have? is that faith able  to save him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_15" data-id="JM2_15">and if a brother or sister may be naked, and may be  destitute of the daily food,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_16" data-id="JM2_16">and any one of you may say to them, `Depart ye in peace, be  warmed, and be filled,' and may not give to them the things  needful for the body, what [is] the profit?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_17" data-id="JM2_17">so also the faith, if it may not have works, is dead by  itself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_18" data-id="JM2_18">But say may some one, Thou hast faith, and I have works,  shew me thy faith out of thy works, and I will shew thee out of  my works my faith:</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_19" data-id="JM2_19">thou -- thou dost believe that God is one; thou dost well,  and the demons believe, and they shudder!</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_20" data-id="JM2_20">And dost thou wish to know, O vain man, that the faith  apart from the works is dead?</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_21" data-id="JM2_21">Abraham our father -- was not he declared righteous out of  works, having brought up Isaac his son upon the altar?</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_22" data-id="JM2_22">dost thou see that the faith was working with his works,  and out of the works the faith was perfected?</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_23" data-id="JM2_23">and fulfilled was the Writing that is saying, `And Abraham  did believe God, and it was reckoned to him -- to  righteousness;' and, `Friend of God' he was called.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_24" data-id="JM2_24">Ye see, then, that out of works is man declared righteous,  and not out of faith only;</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_25" data-id="JM2_25">and in like manner also Rahab the harlot -- was she not out  of works declared righteous, having received the messengers,  and by another way having sent forth?</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_26" data-id="JM2_26">for as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also the  faith apart from the works is dead.</span>
