<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_2" data-id="H15_2">for yourselves have known thoroughly that the day of the  Lord as a thief in the night doth so come,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_3" data-id="H15_3">for when they may say, Peace and surety, then sudden  destruction doth stand by them, as the travail [doth] her who  is with child, and they shall not escape;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_4" data-id="H15_4">and ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day may  catch you as a thief;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_5" data-id="H15_5">all ye are sons of light, and sons of day; we are not of  night, nor of darkness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_6" data-id="H15_6">so, then, we may not sleep as also the others, but watch and  be sober,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_7" data-id="H15_7">for those sleeping, by night do sleep, and those making  themselves drunk, by night are drunken,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_8" data-id="H15_8">and we, being of the day -- let us be sober, putting on a  breastplate of faith and love, and an helmet -- a hope of  salvation,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_9" data-id="H15_9">because God did not appoint us to anger, but to the  acquiring of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_10" data-id="H15_10">who did die for us, that whether we wake -- whether we  sleep -- together with him we may live;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_11" data-id="H15_11">wherefore, comfort ye one another, and build ye up, one the  one, as also ye do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_12" data-id="H15_12">And we ask you, brethren, to know those labouring among  you, and leading you in the Lord, and admonishing you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_13" data-id="H15_13">and to esteem them very abundantly in love, because of  their work; be at peace among yourselves;</span>
