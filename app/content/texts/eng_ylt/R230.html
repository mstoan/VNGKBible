<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_2" data-id="R230_2">And the king taketh counsel, and his heads, and all the  assembly in Jerusalem, to make the passover in the second  month,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_3" data-id="R230_3">for they have not been able to make it at that time, for  the priests have not sanctified themselves sufficiently, and  the people have not been gathered to Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_4" data-id="R230_4">And the thing is right in the eyes of the king, and in the  eyes of all the assembly,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_5" data-id="R230_5">and they establish the thing, to cause to pass over an  intimation into all Israel, from Beer-Sheba even unto Dan, to  come in to make a passover to Jehovah, God of Israel, in  Jerusalem, for not for a long time had they done as it is  written.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_6" data-id="R230_6">And the runners go with letters from the hand of the king  and his heads, into all Israel and Judah, even according to the  command of the king, saying, `O sons of Israel, turn back unto  Jehovah, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and He doth turn  back unto the escaped part that is left of you from the hand of  the kings of Asshur;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_7" data-id="R230_7">and do not be like your fathers, and like your brethren,  who trespassed against Jehovah, God of their fathers, and He  giveth them to desolation, as ye do see.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_8" data-id="R230_8">`Now, harden not your neck like your fathers, give a hand  to Jehovah, and come in to His sanctuary, that He hath  sanctified to the age, and serve Jehovah your God, and the  fierceness of His anger doth turn back from you;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_9" data-id="R230_9">for in your turning back unto Jehovah, your brethren and  your sons have mercies before their captors, even to return to  this land, for gracious and merciful [is] Jehovah your God, and  He doth not turn aside the face from you, if ye turn back unto  Him.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_10" data-id="R230_10">And the runners are passing over from city to city, in the  land of Ephraim and Manasseh, even unto Zebulun: and they are  laughing at them, and mocking at them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_11" data-id="R230_11">only, certain from Asher, and Manasseh, and from Zebulun,  have been humbled, and come in to Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_12" data-id="R230_12">Also, in Judah hath the hand of God been to give to them  one heart to do the command of the king and of the heads, in  the matter of Jehovah;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_13" data-id="R230_13">and much people are gathered to Jerusalem, to make the  feast of unleavened things in the second month -- a mighty  assembly for multitude.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_14" data-id="R230_14">And they arise and turn aside the altars that [are] in  Jerusalem, and all the perfume altars they have turned aside,  and cast [them] to the brook Kidron;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_15" data-id="R230_15">and they slaughter the passover-offering on the fourteenth  of the second month, and the priests and the Levites have been  ashamed, and sanctify themselves, and bring in burnt-offerings  to the house of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_16" data-id="R230_16">And they stand on their station according to their  ordinance; according to the law of Moses the man of God the  priests are sprinkling the blood out of the hand of the  Levites,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_17" data-id="R230_17">for many [are] in the assembly who have not sanctified  themselves, and the Levites [are] over the slaughtering of the  passover-offerings for every one not clean, to sanctify [him]  to Jehovah:</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_18" data-id="R230_18">for a multitude of the people, many from Ephraim and  Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, have not been cleansed, but  have eaten the passover otherwise than it is written; but  Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, `Jehovah, who [is] good, doth  receive atonement for every one</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_19" data-id="R230_19">who hath prepared his heart to seek God -- Jehovah, God of  his fathers -- yet not according to the cleansing of the  sanctuary;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_20" data-id="R230_20">and Jehovah hearkeneth unto Hezekiah, and healeth the  people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_21" data-id="R230_21">And the sons of Israel, those found in Jerusalem, make the  feast of unleavened things seven days with great joy; and  giving praise to Jehovah day by day are the Levites and the  priests, with instruments of praise before Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_22" data-id="R230_22">And Hezekiah speaketh unto the heart of all the Levites,  those giving good understanding concerning Jehovah, and they  eat the appointed thing seven days; sacrificing sacrifices of  peace-offerings, and making confession to Jehovah, God of their  fathers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_23" data-id="R230_23">And all the assembly take counsel to keep other seven  days, and they keep seven days [with] joy;</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_24" data-id="R230_24">for Hezekiah king of Judah hath presented to the assembly  a thousand bullocks, and seven thousand sheep; and the heads  have presented to the assembly bullocks a thousand, and sheep  ten thousand; and priests sanctify themselves in abundance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_25" data-id="R230_25">And all the assembly of Judah rejoice, and the priests,  and the Levites, and all the assembly, those coming in from  Israel, and the sojourners, those coming in from the land of  Israel, and those dwelling in Judah,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_26" data-id="R230_26">and there is great joy in Jerusalem; for from the days of  Solomon son of David king of Israel there is not like this in  Jerusalem,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v R230_27" data-id="R230_27">and the priests, the Levites, rise and bless the people,  and their voice is heard, and their prayer cometh in to His  holy habitation, to the heavens.</span>
