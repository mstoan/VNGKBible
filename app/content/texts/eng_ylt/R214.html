<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_2" data-id="R214_2">And Asa doth that which is good, and that which is right,  in the eyes of Jehovah his God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_3" data-id="R214_3">and turneth aside the altars of the stranger, and the high  places, and breaketh the standing-pillars, and cutteth down the  shrines,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_4" data-id="R214_4">and saith to Judah to seek Jehovah, God of their fathers,  and to do the law and the command;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_5" data-id="R214_5">and he turneth aside out of all cities of Judah the high  places and the images, and the kingdom is quiet before him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_6" data-id="R214_6">And he buildeth cities of bulwarks in Judah, for the land  hath quiet, and there is no war with him in these years,  because Jehovah hath given rest to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_7" data-id="R214_7">And he saith to Judah, `Let us build these cities, and  compass [them] with wall, and towers, two-leaved doors, and  bars, while the land [is] before us, because we have sought  Jehovah our God, we have sought, and He giveth rest to us round  about;' and they build and prosper.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_8" data-id="R214_8">And there is to Asa a force bearing target and spear, out  of Judah three hundred thousand, and out of Benjamin, bearing  shield and treading bow, two hundred and eighty thousand: all  these [are] mighty of valour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_9" data-id="R214_9">And come out unto them doth Zerah the Cushite with a force  of a thousand thousand, and chariots three hundred, and he  cometh in unto Mareshah,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_10" data-id="R214_10">and Asa goeth out before him, and they set battle in array  in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_11" data-id="R214_11">And Asa calleth unto Jehovah his God, and saith, `Jehovah!  it is nothing with Thee to help, between the mighty and those  who have no power; help us, O Jehovah, our God, for on Thee we  have leant, and in Thy name we have come against this  multitude; O Jehovah, our God thou [art]; let him not prevail  with Thee -- mortal man!</span>
