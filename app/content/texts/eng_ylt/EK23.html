<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_2" data-id="EK23_2">Two women were daughters of one mother,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_3" data-id="EK23_3">And they go a-whoring in Egypt, In their youth they have  gone a-whoring, There they have bruised their breasts, And  there they have dealt with the loves of their virginity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_4" data-id="EK23_4">And their names [are] Aholah the elder, And Aholibah her  sister, And they are Mine, and bear sons and daughters. As to  their names -- Samaria [is] Aholah, And Jerusalem [is]  Aholibah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_5" data-id="EK23_5">And go a-whoring doth Aholah under Me, And she doteth on  her lovers, On the neighbouring Assyrians,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_6" data-id="EK23_6">Clothed with blue -- governors and prefects, Desirable  young men all of them, Horsemen, riding on horses,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_7" data-id="EK23_7">And she giveth her whoredoms on them, The choice of the  sons of Asshur, All of them -- even all on whom she doted, By  all their idols she hath been defiled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_8" data-id="EK23_8">And her whoredoms out of Egypt she hath not forsaken, For  with her they lay in her youth, And they dealt with the loves  of her virginity, And they pour out their whoredoms on her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_9" data-id="EK23_9">Therefore I have given her into the hand of her lovers,  Into the hand of sons of Asshur on whom she doted.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_10" data-id="EK23_10">They have uncovered her nakedness, Her sons and her  daughters they have taken, And her by sword they have slain,  And she is a name for women, And judgments they have done with  her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_11" data-id="EK23_11">And see doth her sister Aholibah, And she maketh her  doting love more corrupt than she, And her whoredoms than the  whoredoms of her sister.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_12" data-id="EK23_12">On sons of Asshur she hath doted, Governors and prefects,  Neighbouring ones -- clothed in perfection, Horsemen, riding on  horses, Desirable young men all of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_13" data-id="EK23_13">And I see that she hath been defiled, One way [is] to them  both.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_14" data-id="EK23_14">And she doth add unto her whoredoms, And she seeth graved  men on the wall, Pictures of Chaldeans, graved with red lead,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_15" data-id="EK23_15">Girded with a girdle on their loins, Dyed attire spread  out on their heads, The appearance of rulers -- all of them,  The likeness of sons of Babylon, Chaldea is the land of their  birth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_16" data-id="EK23_16">And she doteth on them at the sight of her eyes, And  sendeth messengers to them, to Chaldea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_17" data-id="EK23_17">And come in unto her do sons of Babylon, To the bed of  loves, And they defile her with their whoredoms, And she is  defiled with them, And her soul is alienated from them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_18" data-id="EK23_18">And she revealeth her whoredoms, And she revealeth her  nakedness, And alienated is My soul from off her, As alienated  was My soul from off her sister.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_19" data-id="EK23_19">And she multiplieth her whoredoms, To remember the days of  her youth, When she went a-whoring in the land of Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_20" data-id="EK23_20">And she doteth on their paramours, Whose flesh [is] the  flesh of asses, And the issue of horses -- their issue.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_21" data-id="EK23_21">Thou lookest after the wickedness of thy youth, In dealing  out of Egypt thy loves, For the sake of the breasts of thy  youth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_22" data-id="EK23_22">Therefore, O Aholibah, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I  am stirring up thy lovers against thee, From whom thy soul hath  been alienated, And have brought them in against thee from  round about.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_23" data-id="EK23_23">Sons of Babylon, and of all Chaldea, Pekod, and Shoa, and  Koa, All the sons of Asshur with them, Desirable young men,  governors and prefects, All of them -- rulers and proclaimed  ones, Riding on horses, all of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_24" data-id="EK23_24">And they have come in against thee, With arms, rider, and  wheel, And with an assembly of peoples; Target, and shield, and  helmet, They do set against thee round about, And I have set  before them judgment, They have judged thee in their Judgments.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_25" data-id="EK23_25">And I have set My jealousy against thee, And they have  dealt with thee in fury, Thy nose and thine ears they turn  aside, And thy posterity by sword falleth, They, thy sons and  thy daughters do take away, And thy posterity is devoured by  fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_26" data-id="EK23_26">And they have stripped thee of thy garments, And have  taken thy beauteous jewels.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_27" data-id="EK23_27">And I have caused thy wickedness to cease from thee, And  thy whoredoms out of the land of Egypt, And thou liftest not up  thine eyes unto them, And Egypt thou dost not remember again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_28" data-id="EK23_28">For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I am giving thee into  a hand that thou hast hated, Into a hand from which thou wast  alienated.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_29" data-id="EK23_29">And they have dealt with thee in hatred, And they have  taken all thy labour, And they have left thee naked and bare,  And revealed hath been the nakedness of thy whoredoms, And the  wickedness of thy whoredoms.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_30" data-id="EK23_30">To do these things to thee, In thy going a-whoring after  nations, Because thou hast been defiled with their idols,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_31" data-id="EK23_31">In the way of thy sister thou hast walked, And I have  given her cup into thy hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_32" data-id="EK23_32">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: The cup of thy sister thou  dost drink, The deep and the wide one, (Thou art for laughter  and for scorn,) Abundant to contain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_33" data-id="EK23_33">With drunkenness and sorrow thou art filled, A cup of  astonishment and desolation, The cup of thy sister Samaria.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_34" data-id="EK23_34">And thou hast drunk it, and hast drained [it], And its  earthen ware thou dost gnaw, And thine own breasts thou  pluckest off, For I have spoken, An affirmation of the Lord  Jehovah,</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_35" data-id="EK23_35">Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast  forgotten Me, And thou dost cast Me behind thy back, Even thou  also bear thy wickedness and thy whoredoms.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_36" data-id="EK23_36">And Jehovah saith unto me, `Son of man, Dost thou judge  Aholah and Aholibah? Declare then to them their abominations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_37" data-id="EK23_37">For they have committed adultery, And blood [is] in their  hands, With their idols they committed adultery, And also their  sons whom they bore to Me, They caused to pass over to them for  food.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_38" data-id="EK23_38">Again, this they have done to Me, They defiled My  sanctuary in that day, And My sabbaths they have polluted.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_39" data-id="EK23_39">And in their slaughtering their sons to their idols They  also come in unto My sanctuary in that day to pollute it, And  lo, thus they have done in the midst of My house,</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_40" data-id="EK23_40">And also that they send to men coming from afar, Unto whom  a messenger is sent, And lo, they have come in for whom thou  hast washed, Painted thine eyes, and put on adornment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_41" data-id="EK23_41">And thou hast sat on a couch of honour, And a table  arrayed before it, And My perfume and My oil placed on it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_42" data-id="EK23_42">And the voice of a multitude at ease [is] with her, And  unto men of the common people are brought in Sabeans from the  wilderness, And they put bracelets on their hands, And a  beauteous crown on their heads.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_43" data-id="EK23_43">And I say of the worn-out one in adulteries, Now they  commit her whoredoms -- she also!</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_44" data-id="EK23_44">And they come in unto her, As the coming in unto a whorish  woman, So they have come in unto Aholah, And unto Aholibah --  the wicked women.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_45" data-id="EK23_45">As to righteous men, they judge them with the judgment of  adulteresses, And the judgment of women shedding blood, For  they [are] adulteresses, And blood [is] in their hands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_46" data-id="EK23_46">For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Bring up against them an  assembly, And give them to trembling and to spoiling.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_47" data-id="EK23_47">And they have cast at them the stone of the assembly, And  cut them with their swords, Their sons and their daughters they  do slay, And their houses with fire they burn.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_48" data-id="EK23_48">And I have caused wickedness to cease from the land, And  instructed have been all the women, And they do not according  to your wickedness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_49" data-id="EK23_49">And they have put your wickedness on you, And the sins of  your idols ye bear, And ye have known that I [am] the Lord  Jehovah!</span>
