<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_2" data-id="GN37_2">These [are] births of Jacob: Joseph, a son of seventeen  years, hath been enjoying himself with his brethren among the  flock, (and he [is] a youth,) with the sons of Bilhah, and with  the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives, and Joseph bringeth in  an account of their evil unto their father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_3" data-id="GN37_3">And Israel hath loved Joseph more than any of his sons, for  he [is] a son of his old age, and hath made for him a long  coat;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_4" data-id="GN37_4">and his brethren see that their father hath loved him more  than any of his brethren, and they hate him, and have not been  able to speak [to] him peaceably.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_5" data-id="GN37_5">And Joseph dreameth a dream, and declareth to his brethren,  and they add still more to hate him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_6" data-id="GN37_6">And he saith unto them, `Hear ye, I pray you, this dream  which I have dreamed:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_7" data-id="GN37_7">that, lo, we are binding bundles in the midst of the field,  and lo, my bundle hath arisen, and hath also stood up, and lo,  your bundles are round about, and bow themselves to my bundle.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_8" data-id="GN37_8">And his brethren say to him, `Dost thou certainly reign  over us? dost thou certainly rule over us?' and they add still  more to hate him, for his dreams, and for his words.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_9" data-id="GN37_9">And he dreameth yet another dream, and recounteth it to his  brethren, and saith, `Lo, I have dreamed a dream again, and lo,  the sun and the moon, and eleven stars, are bowing themselves  to me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_10" data-id="GN37_10">And he recounteth unto his father, and unto his brethren;  and his father pusheth against him, and saith to him, `What  [is] this dream which thou hast dreamt? do we certainly come --  I, and thy mother, and thy brethren -- to bow ourselves to  thee, to the earth?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_11" data-id="GN37_11">and his brethren are zealous against him, and his father  hath watched the matter.</span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_13" data-id="GN37_13">and Israel saith unto Joseph, `Are not thy brethren  feeding in Shechem? come, and I send thee unto them;' and he  saith to him, `Here [am] I;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_14" data-id="GN37_14">and he saith to him, `Go, I pray thee, see the peace of  thy brethren, and the peace of the flock, and bring me back  word;' and he sendeth him from the valley of Hebron, and he  cometh to Shechem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_15" data-id="GN37_15">And a man findeth him, and lo, he is wandering in the  field, and the man asketh him, saying, `What seekest thou?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_16" data-id="GN37_16">and he saith, `My brethren I am seeking, declare to me, I  pray thee, where they are feeding?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_17" data-id="GN37_17">And the man saith, `They have journeyed from this, for I  have heard some saying, Let us go to Dothan,' and Joseph goeth  after his brethren, and findeth them in Dothan.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_18" data-id="GN37_18">And they see him from afar, even before he draweth near  unto them, and they conspire against him to put him to death.</span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_22" data-id="GN37_22">and Reuben saith unto them, `Shed no blood; cast him into  this pit which [is] in the wilderness, and put not forth a hand  upon him,' -- in order to deliver him out of their hand, to  bring him back unto his father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_23" data-id="GN37_23">And it cometh to pass, when Joseph hath come unto his  brethren, that they strip Joseph of his coat, the long coat  which [is] upon him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_24" data-id="GN37_24">and take him and cast him into the pit, and the pit [is]  empty, there is no water in it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_25" data-id="GN37_25">And they sit down to eat bread, and they lift up their  eyes, and look, and lo, a company of Ishmaelites coming from  Gilead, and their camels bearing spices, and balm, and myrrh,  going to take [them] down to Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_26" data-id="GN37_26">And Judah saith unto his brethren, `What gain when we slay  our brother, and have concealed his blood?</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_27" data-id="GN37_27">Come, and we sell him to the Ishmaelites, and our hands  are not on him, for he [is] our brother -- our flesh;' and his  brethren hearken.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_28" data-id="GN37_28">And Midianite merchantmen pass by and they draw out and  bring up Joseph out of the pit, and sell Joseph to the  Ishmaelites for twenty silverlings, and they bring Joseph into  Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_29" data-id="GN37_29">And Reuben returneth unto the pit, and lo, Joseph is not  in the pit, and he rendeth his garments,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_30" data-id="GN37_30">and he returneth unto his brethren, and saith, `The lad is  not, and I -- whither am I going?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_31" data-id="GN37_31">And they take the coat of Joseph, and slaughter a kid of  the goats, and dip the coat in the blood,</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_32" data-id="GN37_32">and send the long coat, and they bring [it] in unto their  father, and say, `This have we found; discern, we pray thee,  whether it [is] thy son's coat or not?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_33" data-id="GN37_33">And he discerneth it, and saith, `My son's coat! an evil  beast hath devoured him; torn -- torn is Joseph!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN37_34" data-id="GN37_34">And Jacob rendeth his raiment, and putteth sackcloth on  his loins, and becometh a mourner for his son many days,</span>
