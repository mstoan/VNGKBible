<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_2" data-id="S13_2">And it cometh to pass, at that time, that Eli is lying down  in his place, and his eyes have begun to be dim -- he is not able  to see.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_3" data-id="S13_3">And the lamp of God is not yet extinguished, and Samuel is  lying down in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God [is],</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_9" data-id="S13_9">And Eli saith to Samuel, `Go, lie down, and it hath been, if  He doth call unto thee, that thou hast said, Speak, Jehovah,  for Thy servant is hearing;' and Samuel goeth and lieth down in  his place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_10" data-id="S13_10">And Jehovah cometh, and stationeth Himself, and calleth as  time by time, `Samuel, Samuel;' and Samuel saith, `Speak, for  Thy servant if hearing.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_14" data-id="S13_14">and therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli: the  iniquity of the house of Eli is not atoned for, by sacrifice,  and by offering -- unto the age.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_15" data-id="S13_15">And Samuel lieth till the morning, and openeth the doors of  the house of Jehovah, and Samuel is afraid of declaring the  vision unto Eli.</span>
