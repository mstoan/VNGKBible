<div class="c">5</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_1" data-id="C25_1">For we have known that if our earthly house of the  tabernacle may be thrown down, a building from God we have, an  house not made with hands -- age-during -- in the heavens,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_2" data-id="C25_2">for also in this we groan, with our dwelling that is from  heaven earnestly desiring to clothe ourselves,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_3" data-id="C25_3">if so be that, having clothed ourselves, we shall not be  found naked,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_4" data-id="C25_4">for we also who are in the tabernacle do groan, being  burdened, seeing we wish not to unclothe ourselves, but to  clothe ourselves, that the mortal may be swallowed up of the  life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_5" data-id="C25_5">And He who did work us to this self-same thing [is] God, who  also did give to us the earnest of the Spirit;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_6" data-id="C25_6">having courage, then, at all times, and knowing that being  at home in the body, we are away from home from the Lord, --</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_7" data-id="C25_7">for through faith we walk, not through sight --</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_8" data-id="C25_8">we have courage, and are well pleased rather to be away from  the home of the body, and to be at home with the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_9" data-id="C25_9">Wherefore also we are ambitious, whether at home or away  from home, to be well pleasing to him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_10" data-id="C25_10">for all of us it behoveth to be manifested before the  tribunal of the Christ, that each one may receive the things  [done] through the body, in reference to the things that he  did, whether good or evil;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_11" data-id="C25_11">having known, therefore, the fear of the Lord, we persuade  men, and to God we are manifested, and I hope also in your  consciences to have been manifested;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_12" data-id="C25_12">for not again ourselves do we recommend to you, but we are  giving occasion to you of glorifying in our behalf, that ye may  have [something] in reference to those glorifying in face and  not in heart;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_13" data-id="C25_13">for whether we were beside ourselves, [it was] to God;  whether we be of sound mind -- [it is] to you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_14" data-id="C25_14">for the love of the Christ doth constrain us, having judged  thus: that if one for all died, then the whole died,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_15" data-id="C25_15">and for all he died, that those living, no more to  themselves may live, but to him who died for them, and was  raised again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_16" data-id="C25_16">So that we henceforth have known no one according to the  flesh, and even if we have known Christ according to the flesh,  yet now we know him no more;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_17" data-id="C25_17">so that if any one [is] in Christ -- [he is] a new  creature; the old things did pass away, lo, become new have the  all things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_18" data-id="C25_18">And the all things [are] of God, who reconciled us to  Himself through Jesus Christ, and did give to us the  ministration of the reconciliation,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_19" data-id="C25_19">how that God was in Christ -- a world reconciling to  Himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses; and having put  in us the word of the reconciliation,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_20" data-id="C25_20">in behalf of Christ, then, we are ambassadors, as if God  were calling through us, we beseech, in behalf of Christ, `Be  ye reconciled to God;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_21" data-id="C25_21">for him who did not know sin, in our behalf He did make  sin, that we may become the righteousness of God in him.</span>
