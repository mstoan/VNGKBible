<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_2" data-id="C15_2">and ye are having been puffed up, and did not rather mourn,  that he may be removed out of the midst of you who did this  work,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_3" data-id="C15_3">for I indeed, as being absent as to the body, and present as  to the spirit, have already judged, as being present, him who  so wrought this thing:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_4" data-id="C15_4">in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ -- ye being gathered  together, also my spirit -- with the power of our Lord Jesus  Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_5" data-id="C15_5">to deliver up such a one to the Adversary for the  destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the  day of the Lord Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_6" data-id="C15_6">Not good [is] your glorying; have ye not known that a little  leaven the whole lump doth leaven?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_7" data-id="C15_7">cleanse out, therefore, the old leaven, that ye may be a new  lump, according as ye are unleavened, for also our passover for  us was sacrificed -- Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_8" data-id="C15_8">so that we may keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with  the leaven of evil and wickedness, but with unleavened food of  sincerity and truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_9" data-id="C15_9">I did write to you in the epistle, not to keep company with  whoremongers --</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_10" data-id="C15_10">and not certainly with the whoremongers of this world, or  with the covetous, or extortioners, or idolaters, seeing ye  ought then to go forth out of the world --</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_11" data-id="C15_11">and now, I did write to you not to keep company with [him],  if any one, being named a brother, may be a whoremonger, or  covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an  extortioner -- with such a one not even to eat together;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_12" data-id="C15_12">for what have I also those without to judge? those within  do ye not judge?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_13" data-id="C15_13">and those without God doth judge; and put ye away the evil  from among yourselves.</span>
