<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK35_2" data-id="EK35_2">`Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy  against it,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK35_3" data-id="EK35_3">and thou hast said to it: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I  [am] against thee, O mount Seir, And have stretched out My hand  against thee, And made thee a desolation and an astonishment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK35_4" data-id="EK35_4">Thy cities a waste I make, and thou art a desolation, And  thou hast known that I [am] Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK35_5" data-id="EK35_5">Because of thy having an enmity age-during, And thou dost  saw the sons of Israel, By the hands of the sword, In the time  of their calamity, In the time of the iniquity of the end:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK35_6" data-id="EK35_6">Therefore, I live -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah,  Surely for blood I do appoint thee, And blood doth pursue thee,  If blood thou hast not hated, Blood also doth pursue thee.</span>
