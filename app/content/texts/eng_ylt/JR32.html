<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_2" data-id="JR32_2">And then the forces of the king of Babylon are laying siege  against Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet hath been shut up  in the court of the prison that [is] in the house of the king  of Judah,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_3" data-id="JR32_3">Where Zedekiah king of Judah hath shut him up, saying,  `Wherefore art thou prophesying, saying, Thus said Jehovah, Lo,  I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and  he hath captured it;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_4" data-id="JR32_4">And Zedekiah king of Judah doth not escape out of the hand  of the Chaldeans, but is certainly given into the hand of the  king of Babylon, and his mouth hath spoken with his mouth, and  his eyes see his eyes,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_5" data-id="JR32_5">And [to] Babylon he leadeth Zedekiah, and there he is till  My inspecting him, -- an affirmation of Jehovah -- because ye  fight with the Chaldeans, ye do not prosper.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_6" data-id="JR32_6">And Jeremiah saith, `A word of Jehovah hath been unto me  saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_7" data-id="JR32_7">Lo, Hanameel son of Shallum, thine uncle, is coming unto  thee, saying, Buy for thee my field that [is] in Anathoth, for  thine [is] the right of redemption -- to buy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_8" data-id="JR32_8">And Hanameel, my uncle's son, cometh in unto me, according  to the word of Jehovah, unto the court of the prison, and saith  unto me, `Buy, I pray thee, my field that [is] in Anathoth,  that [is] in the land of Benjamin, for thine [is] the right of  possession, and thine of redemption -- buy for thee.' And I  know that it [is] the word of Jehovah,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_9" data-id="JR32_9">And I buy the field, that [is] in Anathoth, from Hanameel,  my uncle's son, and I weigh to him the money -- seventeen  shekels of silver.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_10" data-id="JR32_10">And I write in a book, and seal, and cause witnesses to  testify, and weigh the silver in balances;</span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_13" data-id="JR32_13">And I charge Baruch before their eyes, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_14" data-id="JR32_14">`Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, Take these  books, this purchase-book, both the sealed one and the open  one, and thou hast put them in an earthen vessel, that they may  remain many days;</span>

<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_24" data-id="JR32_24">`Lo, the mounts -- they have come in to the city to  capture it, and the city hath been given into the hand of the  Chaldeans who are fighting against it, because of the sword,  and the famine, and the pestilence; and that which Thou hast  spoken hath come to pass, and lo, Thou art seeing;</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_25" data-id="JR32_25">Yet Thou hast said unto me, O Lord Jehovah, Buy for thee  the field with money, and cause witnesses to testify -- and the  city hath been given into the hand of the Chaldeans!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_26" data-id="JR32_26">And the word of Jehovah is unto Jeremiah, saying:</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_27" data-id="JR32_27">`Lo, I [am] Jehovah, God of all flesh: For Me is anything  too wonderful?</span>

<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_29" data-id="JR32_29">And come in have the Chaldeans who are fighting against  this city, and they have set this city on fire, and have burned  it, and the houses on whose roofs they made perfume to Baal,  and poured out libations to other gods, so as to provoke Me to  anger.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_30" data-id="JR32_30">For the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah have been  only doing evil in Mine eyes, from their youth; for the sons of  Israel are only provoking Me with the work of their hands -- an  affirmation of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_31" data-id="JR32_31">`For a cause of Mine anger, and a cause of My fury, hath  this city been to Me, even from the day that they built it, and  unto this day -- to turn it aside from before My face,</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_32" data-id="JR32_32">Because of all the evil of the sons of Israel, and of the  sons of Judah that they have done, so as to provoke Me -- they,  their kings, their heads, their priests, and their prophets,  and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_33" data-id="JR32_33">And they turn unto Me the neck, and not the face, and  teaching them, rising early and teaching, and they are not  hearkening to accept instruction.</span>

<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_40" data-id="JR32_40">and I have made for them a covenant age-during, in that I  turn not back from after them for My doing them good, and My  fear I put in their heart, so as not to turn aside from me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_41" data-id="JR32_41">and I have rejoiced over them to do them good, and have  planted them in this land in truth, with all my heart, and with  all My soul.</span>
