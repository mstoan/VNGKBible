<div class="c">15</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_1" data-id="RM15_1">And we ought -- we who are strong -- to bear the  infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_2" data-id="RM15_2">for let each one of us please the neighbor for good, unto  edification,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_3" data-id="RM15_3">for even the Christ did not please himself, but, according  as it hath been written, `The reproaches of those reproaching  Thee fell upon me;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_4" data-id="RM15_4">for, as many things as were written before, for our  instruction were written before, that through the endurance,  and the exhortation of the Writings, we might have the hope.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_5" data-id="RM15_5">And may the God of the endurance, and of the exhortation,  give to you to have the same mind toward one another,  according to Christ Jesus;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_6" data-id="RM15_6">that with one accord -- with one mouth -- ye may glorify  the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_7" data-id="RM15_7">wherefore receive ye one another, according as also the  Christ did receive us, to the glory of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_8" data-id="RM15_8">And I say Jesus Christ to have become a ministrant of  circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises to  the fathers,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_9" data-id="RM15_9">and the nations for kindness to glorify God, according as  it hath been written, `Because of this I will confess to Thee  among nations, and to Thy name I will sing praise,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_10" data-id="RM15_10">and again it saith, `Rejoice ye nations, with His people;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_11" data-id="RM15_11">and again, `Praise the Lord, all ye nations; and laud Him,  all ye peoples;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_12" data-id="RM15_12">and again, Isaiah saith, `There shall be the root of  Jesse, and he who is rising to rule nations -- upon him shall  nations hope;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_13" data-id="RM15_13">and the God of the hope shall fill you with all joy and  peace in the believing, for your abounding in the hope in power  of the Holy Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_14" data-id="RM15_14">And I am persuaded, my brethren -- I myself also --  concerning you, that ye yourselves also are full of goodness,  having been filled with all knowledge, able also one another to  admonish;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_15" data-id="RM15_15">and the more boldly I did write to you, brethren, in part,  as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to  me by God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_16" data-id="RM15_16">for my being a servant of Jesus Christ to the nations,  acting as priest in the good news of God, that the offering up  of the nations may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy  Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_17" data-id="RM15_17">I have, then, a boasting in Christ Jesus, in the things  pertaining to God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_18" data-id="RM15_18">for I will not dare to speak anything of the things that  Christ did not work through me, to obedience of nations, by  word and deed,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_19" data-id="RM15_19">in power of signs and wonders, in power of the Spirit of  God; so that I, from Jerusalem, and in a circle as far as  Illyricum, have fully preached the good news of the Christ;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_20" data-id="RM15_20">and so counting it honour to proclaim good news, not where  Christ was named -- that upon another's foundation I might not  build --</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_21" data-id="RM15_21">but according as it hath been written, `To whom it was not  told concerning him, they shall see; and they who have not  heard, shall understand.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_22" data-id="RM15_22">Wherefore, also, I was hindered many times from coming  unto you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_23" data-id="RM15_23">and now, no longer having place in these parts, and having  a longing to come unto you for many years,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_24" data-id="RM15_24">when I may go on to Spain I will come unto you, for I hope  in going through, to see you, and by you to be set forward  thither, if of you first, in part, I shall be filled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_25" data-id="RM15_25">And, now, I go on to Jerusalem, ministering to the saints;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_26" data-id="RM15_26">for it pleased Macedonia and Achaia well to make a certain  contribution for the poor of the saints who [are] in  Jerusalem;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_27" data-id="RM15_27">for it pleased well, and their debtors they are, for if in  their spiritual things the nations did participate, they ought  also, in the fleshly things, to minister to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_28" data-id="RM15_28">This, then, having finished, and having sealed to them  this fruit, I will return through you, to Spain;</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_29" data-id="RM15_29">and I have known that coming unto you -- in the fulness of  the blessing of the good news of Christ I shall come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_30" data-id="RM15_30">And I call upon you, brethren, through our Lord Jesus  Christ, and through the love of the Spirit, to strive together  with me in the prayers for me unto God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_31" data-id="RM15_31">that I may be delivered from those not believing in Judea,  and that my ministration, that [is] for Jerusalem, may become  acceptable to the saints;</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_32" data-id="RM15_32">that in joy I may come unto you, through the will of God,  and may be refreshed with you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_33" data-id="RM15_33">and the God of the peace [be] with you all. Amen.</span>
