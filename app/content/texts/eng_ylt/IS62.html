<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS62_2" data-id="IS62_2">And nations have seen thy righteousness, And all kings  thine honour, And He is giving to thee a new name, That the  mouth of Jehovah doth define.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS62_3" data-id="IS62_3">And thou hast been a crown of beauty in the hand of  Jehovah, And a diadem of royalty in the hand of thy God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS62_4" data-id="IS62_4">It is not said of thee any more, `Forsaken!' And of thy  land it is not said any more, `Desolate,' For to thee is cried,  `My delight [is] in her,' And to thy land, `Married,' For  Jehovah hath delighted in thee, And thy land is married.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS62_5" data-id="IS62_5">For a young man doth marry a virgin, Thy Builders do marry  thee, With the joy of a bridegroom over a bride, Rejoice over  thee doth thy God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS62_6" data-id="IS62_6">`On thy walls, O Jerusalem, I have appointed watchmen, All  the day, and all the night, Continually, they are not silent.'  O ye remembrancers of Jehovah, Keep not silence for yourselves,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS62_7" data-id="IS62_7">And give not silence to Him, Till He establish, and till He  make Jerusalem A praise in the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS62_8" data-id="IS62_8">Sworn hath Jehovah by His right hand, Even by the arm of  His strength: `I give not thy corn any more [as] food for thine  enemies, Nor do sons of a stranger drink thy new wine, For  which thou hast laboured.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS62_9" data-id="IS62_9">For, those gathering it do eat it, and have praised  Jehovah, And those collecting it do drink it in My holy  courts.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS62_10" data-id="IS62_10">Pass ye on, pass on through the gates, Prepare ye the way  of the people, Raise up, raise up the highway, clear it from  stones, Lift up an ensign over the peoples.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS62_11" data-id="IS62_11">Lo, Jehovah hath proclaimed unto the end of the earth:  `Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Lo, thy salvation hath come,'  Lo, his hire [is] with him, and his wage before him.</span>
