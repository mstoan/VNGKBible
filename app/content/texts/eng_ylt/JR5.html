<div class="c">5</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_1" data-id="JR5_1">Go to and fro in streets of Jerusalem, And see, I pray you,  and know, And seek in her broad places, if ye find a man, If  there be one doing judgment, seeking stedfastness -- Then am I  propitious to her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_2" data-id="JR5_2">And if they say, `Jehovah liveth,' Surely to a falsehood  they swear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_3" data-id="JR5_3">Jehovah, Thine eyes, are they not on stedfastness? Thou hast  smitten them, and they have not grieved, Thou hast consumed  them, They have refused to receive instruction, They made their  faces harder than a rock, They have refused to turn back.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_4" data-id="JR5_4">And I -- I said, `Surely these [are] poor, They have been  foolish, For they have not known the way of Jehovah, The  judgment of their God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_5" data-id="JR5_5">I get me to the great, and I speak with them, For they have  known the way of Jehovah, The judgment of their God.' Surely  they together have broken the yoke, They have drawn away the  bands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_6" data-id="JR5_6">Therefore smitten them hath a lion out of the forest, A wolf  of the deserts doth spoil them, A leopard is watching over  their cities, Every one who is going out of them is torn, For  many have been their transgressions, Mighty have been their  backslidings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_7" data-id="JR5_7">For this I am not propitious to thee, Thy sons have forsaken  Me, And are satisfied by that which is not god, I satisfy them,  and they commit adultery, And at the house of a harlot They  gather themselves together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_8" data-id="JR5_8">Fed horses -- they have been early risers, Each to the wife  of his neighbour they neigh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_9" data-id="JR5_9">For these do I not lay a charge? An affirmation of Jehovah,  And on a nation such as this, Doth not My soul avenge itself?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_10" data-id="JR5_10">Go ye up on her walls, and destroy, And a completion make  not, Turn aside her branches, for they [are] not Jehovah's,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_11" data-id="JR5_11">For dealt treacherously against Me have the house of  Israel, And the house of Judah, an affirmation of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_12" data-id="JR5_12">They have lied against Jehovah, And they say, `[It is] not  He, Nor come in against us doth evil, Yea, sword and famine we  do not see.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_13" data-id="JR5_13">And the prophets become wind, And the word is not in them,'  -- thus it is done by them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_14" data-id="JR5_14">Therefore, thus said Jehovah, God of Hosts, Because of your  speaking this word, Lo, I am making My words in thy mouth  become fire, And this people wood, and it hath devoured them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_15" data-id="JR5_15">Lo, I am bringing against you a nation from afar, O house  of Israel, an affirmation of Jehovah, A nation -- strong it  [is], a nation -- from of old it [is], A nation -- thou knowest  not its tongue, Nor understandest what it speaketh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_16" data-id="JR5_16">Its quiver [is] as an open sepulchre, All of them -- mighty  ones.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_17" data-id="JR5_17">And it hath consumed thy harvest and thy bread, They  consume thy sons, and thy daughters, It consumeth thy flock,  and thy herd, It consumeth thy vine, and thy fig-tree, It  maketh poor thy fenced cities, In which thou art trusting -- by  the sword.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_18" data-id="JR5_18">And even in those days, an affirmation of Jehovah, I do not  make you a completion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_19" data-id="JR5_19">And it hath come to pass, when ye say, `For what hath  Jehovah our God done to us all these?' That thou hast said unto  them, `As ye have forsaken Me, And serve the gods of a  foreigner in your land, So do ye serve strangers in a land not  yours.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_20" data-id="JR5_20">Declare ye this in the house of Jacob, And sound ye it in  Judah, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_21" data-id="JR5_21">Hear ye, I pray you, this, O people, foolish and without  heart, Eyes they have, and they see not, Ears they have, and  they hear not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_22" data-id="JR5_22">Me do ye not fear, an affirmation of Jehovah? From My  presence are ye not pained? Who hath made sand the border of  the sea, A limit age-during, and it passeth not over it, They  shake themselves, and they are not able, Yea, sounded have its  billows, and they pass not over.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_23" data-id="JR5_23">And this people hath an apostate and rebellious heart, They  have turned aside, and they go on.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_24" data-id="JR5_24">And they have not said in their heart, `Let us fear, we  pray you, Jehovah our God, who is giving rain, The sprinkling  and the gathered, in its season, The appointed weeks of harvest  He keepeth for us.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_25" data-id="JR5_25">Your iniquities have turned these away, And your sins have  kept the good from you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_26" data-id="JR5_26">For the wicked have been found among My people. It looketh  about the covering of snares, They have set up a trap -- men  they capture.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_27" data-id="JR5_27">As a cage full of fowls, So their houses are full of  deceit, Therefore they have been great, and are rich.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_28" data-id="JR5_28">They have been fat, they have shone, Yea, they have  overpassed the acts of the evil, Judgment they have not judged,  The judgment of the fatherless -- and they prosper, And the  judgment of the needy they have not judged.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_29" data-id="JR5_29">For these do not I inspect, an affirmation of Jehovah, On a  nation such as this, Doth not My soul avenge itself?</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_30" data-id="JR5_30">An astonishing and horrible thing hath been in the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR5_31" data-id="JR5_31">The prophets have prophesied falsely, And the priests bear  rule by their means, And My people have loved [it] so, And what  do they at its latter end?</span>
