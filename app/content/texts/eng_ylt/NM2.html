<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM2_2" data-id="NM2_2">For turned back hath Jehovah to the excellency of Jacob, As  [to] the excellency of Israel, For emptied them out have  emptiers, And their branches they have marred.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM2_3" data-id="NM2_3">The shield of his mighty ones is become red, Men of might  [are in] scarlet, With fiery torches [is] the chariot in a day  of his preparation, And the firs have been caused to tremble.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM2_4" data-id="NM2_4">In out-places shine do the chariots, They go to and fro in  broad places, Their appearances [are] like torches, As  lightnings they run.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM2_5" data-id="NM2_5">He doth remember his honourable ones, They stumble in their  goings, They hasten [to] its wall, and prepared is the  covering.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM2_6" data-id="NM2_6">Gates of the rivers have been opened, And the palace is  dissolved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM2_7" data-id="NM2_7">And it is established -- she hath removed, She hath been  brought up, And her handmaids are leading as the voice of  doves, Tabering on their hearts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM2_8" data-id="NM2_8">And Nineveh [is] as a pool of waters, From of old it [is] --  and they are fleeing! `Stand ye, stand;' and none is turning!</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM2_9" data-id="NM2_9">Seize ye silver, seize ye gold, And there is no end to the  prepared things, [To] the abundance of all desirable vessels.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM2_10" data-id="NM2_10">She is empty, yea, emptiness and waste, And the heart hath  melted, And the knees have smitten together, And great pain  [is] in all loins, And the faces of all of them have gathered  paleness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM2_11" data-id="NM2_11">Where [is] the habitation of lionesses? And a feeding-place  it [is] for young lions Where walked hath a lion, an old lion,  A lion's whelp, and there is none troubling.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM2_12" data-id="NM2_12">The lion is tearing parts [for] his whelps, And is  strangling for his lionesses, And he doth fill [with] prey his  holes, And his habitations [with] rapine.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM2_13" data-id="NM2_13">Lo, I [am] against thee, An affirmation of Jehovah of  Hosts, And I have burned in smoke its chariot, And thy young  lions consume doth a sword, And I have cut off from the land  thy prey, And not heard any more is the voice of thy  messengers!</span>
