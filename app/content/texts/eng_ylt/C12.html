<div class="c">2</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_1" data-id="C12_1">And I, having come unto you, brethren, came -- not in  superiority of discourse or wisdom -- declaring to you the  testimony of God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_2" data-id="C12_2">for I decided not to know any thing among you, except Jesus  Christ, and him crucified;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_3" data-id="C12_3">and I, in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling, was  with you;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_4" data-id="C12_4">and my word and my preaching was not in persuasive words of  human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power  --</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_5" data-id="C12_5">that your faith may not be in the wisdom of men, but in the  power of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_6" data-id="C12_6">And wisdom we speak among the perfect, and wisdom not of  this age, nor of the rulers of this age -- of those becoming  useless,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_7" data-id="C12_7">but we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a secret, that God  foreordained before the ages to our glory,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_8" data-id="C12_8">which no one of the rulers of this age did know, for if they  had known, the Lord of the glory they would not have crucified;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_9" data-id="C12_9">but, according as it hath been written, `What eye did not  see, and ear did not hear, and upon the heart of man came not  up, what God did prepare for those loving Him --'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_10" data-id="C12_10">but to us did God reveal [them] through His Spirit, for the  Spirit all things doth search, even the depths of God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_11" data-id="C12_11">for who of men hath known the things of the man, except the  spirit of the man that [is] in him? so also the things of God  no one hath known, except the Spirit of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_12" data-id="C12_12">And we the spirit of the world did not receive, but the  Spirit that [is] of God, that we may know the things conferred  by God on us,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_13" data-id="C12_13">which things also we speak, not in words taught by human  wisdom, but in those taught by the Holy Spirit, with spiritual  things spiritual things comparing,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_14" data-id="C12_14">and the natural man doth not receive the things of the  Spirit of God, for to him they are foolishness, and he is not  able to know [them], because spiritually they are discerned;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_15" data-id="C12_15">and he who is spiritual, doth discern indeed all things,  and he himself is by no one discerned;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_16" data-id="C12_16">for who did know the mind of the Lord that he shall  instruct Him? and we -- we have the mind of Christ.</span>
