<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_2" data-id="TT1_2">upon hope of life age-during, which God, who doth not lie,  did promise before times of ages,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_3" data-id="TT1_3">(and He manifested in proper times His word,) in preaching,  which I was entrusted with, according to a charge of God our  Saviour,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_4" data-id="TT1_4">to Titus -- true child according to a common faith: Grace,  kindness, peace, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ  our Saviour!</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_5" data-id="TT1_5">For this cause left I thee in Crete, that the things lacking  thou mayest arrange, and mayest set down in every city elders,  as I did appoint to thee;</span>
