<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC1_2" data-id="MC1_2">Hear, O peoples, all of them! Attend, O earth, and its  fulness, And the Lord Jehovah is against you for a witness, The  Lord from His holy temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC1_3" data-id="MC1_3">For lo, Jehovah is going out from His place, And He hath  come down, And hath trodden on high places of earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC1_4" data-id="MC1_4">Melted have been the mountains under Him, And the valleys do  rend themselves, As wax from the presence of fire, As waters  cast down by a slope.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC1_5" data-id="MC1_5">For the transgression of Jacob [is] all this, And for the  sins of the house of Israel. What [is] the transgression of  Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what the high places of Judah? Is  it not Jerusalem?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC1_6" data-id="MC1_6">And I have set Samaria for a heap of the field, For  plantations of a vineyard, And poured out into a valley her  stones, And her foundations I uncover.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC1_7" data-id="MC1_7">And all her graven images are beaten down, And all her gifts  are burnt with fire, And all her idols I make a desolation,  For, from the hire of a harlot she gathered, and unto the hire  of a harlot they return.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC1_8" data-id="MC1_8">For this I lament and howl, I go spoiled and naked, I make a  lamentation like dragons, And a mourning like daughters of an  ostrich.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC1_9" data-id="MC1_9">For mortal [are] her wounds, For it hath come unto Judah, It  hath come to a gate of My people -- to Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC1_10" data-id="MC1_10">In Gath tell ye not -- in Acco weep not, In Beth-Aphrah, in  dust roll thyself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC1_11" data-id="MC1_11">Pass over for thee, O inhabitant of Shaphir, Naked one of  shame. Not gone out hath the inhabitant of Zaanan, The  lamentation of Beth-Ezel doth take from you its standing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC1_12" data-id="MC1_12">For stayed for good hath the inhabitant of Maroth, For evil  hath come down from Jehovah to the gate of Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC1_13" data-id="MC1_13">Bind the chariot to a swift beast, O inhabitant of Lachish,  The beginning of sin [is] she to the daughter of Zion, For in  thee have been found the transgressions of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC1_14" data-id="MC1_14">Therefore thou givest presents to Moresheth-Gath, The  houses of Achzib become a lying thing to the kings of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC1_15" data-id="MC1_15">Yet the possessor I do bring in to thee, O inhabitant of  Mareshah, To Adullam come in doth the honour of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC1_16" data-id="MC1_16">Make bald and shave, for thy delightful sons, Enlarge thy  baldness as an eagle, For they have removed from thee!</span>
