<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR40_2" data-id="JR40_2">And the chief of the executioners taketh Jeremiah, and  saith unto him, `Jehovah thy God hath spoken this evil  concerning this place,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR40_3" data-id="JR40_3">and Jehovah bringeth [it] in, and doth as He spake, because  ye have sinned against Jehovah, and have not hearkened to His  voice, even this thing hath been to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR40_4" data-id="JR40_4">`And now, lo, I have loosed thee to-day from the chains  that [are] on thy hand; if good in thine eyes to come with me  [to] Babylon, come, and I keep mine eye upon thee: and if evil  in thine eyes to come with me to Babylon, forbear; see, all the  land [is] before thee, whither [it be] good, and whither [it  be] right in thine eyes to go -- go.' --</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR40_5" data-id="JR40_5">and while he doth not reply -- `Or turn back unto Gedaliah  son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath  appointed over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him in the  midst of the people, or whithersoever it is right in thine eyes  to go -- go.' And the chief of the executioners giveth to him  for the way, and a gift, and sendeth him away,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR40_6" data-id="JR40_6">and Jeremiah cometh in unto Gedaliah son of Ahikam, to  Mizpah, and dwelleth with him, in the midst of the people who  are left in the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR40_7" data-id="JR40_7">And all the heads of the forces that [are] in the field  hear, they and their men, that the king of Babylon hath  appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam over the land, and that he  hath charged him [with] men, and women, and infants, and of the  poor of the land, of those who have not been removed to  Babylon;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR40_8" data-id="JR40_8">and they come in unto Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael son  of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan sons of Kareah, and  Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the  Netophathite, and Jezaniah son of the Maachathite, they and  their men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR40_9" data-id="JR40_9">And swear to them doth Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of  Shaphan, and to their men, saying, `Be not afraid of serving  the Chaldeans, abide in the land, and serve the king of  Babylon, and it is well for you;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR40_10" data-id="JR40_10">and I, lo, I am dwelling in Mizpah, to stand before the  Chaldeans who are come in unto us, and ye, gather ye wine, and  summer fruit, and oil, and put in your vessels, and dwell in  your cities that ye have taken.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR40_11" data-id="JR40_11">And also all the Jews who [are] in Moab, and among the  sons of Ammon, and in Edom, and who [are] in all the lands,  have heard that the king of Babylon hath given a remnant to  Judah, and that he hath appointed over them Gedaliah son of  Ahikam, son of Shaphan,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR40_12" data-id="JR40_12">and all the Jews from all the places whither they have  been driven, turn back and enter the land of Judah, unto  Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and they gather wine and summer fruit --  very much.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR40_13" data-id="JR40_13">And Johanan son of Kareah, and all the heads of the forces  that [are] in the field, have come in unto Gedaliah to Mizpah,</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR40_15" data-id="JR40_15">And Johanan son of Kareah hath spoken unto Gedaliah in  secret, in Mizpah, saying, `Let me go, I pray thee, and I smite  Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no one doth know; why doth he  smite thy soul? and scattered have been all Judah who are  gathered unto thee, and perished hath the remnant of Judah.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR40_16" data-id="JR40_16">And Gedaliah son of Ahikam saith unto Johanan son of  Kareah, `Thou dost not do this thing, for falsehood thou art  speaking concerning Ishmael.'</span>
