<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS17_2" data-id="JS17_2">And there is for the sons of Manasseh who are left, for  their families; for the sons of Abiezer, and for the sons of  Helek, and for the sons of Asriel, and for the sons of Shechem,  and for the sons of Hepher, and for the sons of Shemida; these  [are] the children of Manasseh son of Joseph -- the males -- by  their families.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS17_3" data-id="JS17_3">As to Zelophehad, son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of  Machir, son of Manasseh, he hath no children except daughters,  and these [are] the names of his daughters: Mahlah, and Noah,  Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS17_4" data-id="JS17_4">and they draw near before Eleazar the priest, and  before Joshua son of Nun, and before the princes,  saying, `Jehovah commanded Moses to give to us an inheritance  in the midst of our brethren;' and he giveth to them, at the  command of Jehovah, an inheritance in the midst of the brethren  of their father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS17_5" data-id="JS17_5">And ten portions fall [to] Manasseh, apart from the land of  Gilead and Bashan, which [are] beyond the Jordan;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS17_6" data-id="JS17_6">for the daughters of Manasseh have inherited an inheritance  in the midst of his sons, and the land of Gilead hath been to  the sons of Manasseh who are left.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS17_7" data-id="JS17_7">And the border of Manasseh is from Asher to Michmethah,  which [is] on the front of Shechem, and the border hath gone on  unto the right, unto the inhabitants of En-Tappuah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS17_8" data-id="JS17_8">To Manasseh hath been the land of Tappuah, and Tappuah unto  the border of Manasseh is to the sons of Ephraim.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS17_9" data-id="JS17_9">And the border hath come down [to] the brook of Kanah,  southward of the brook; these cities of Ephraim [are] in the  midst of the cities of Manasseh, and the border of Manasseh  [is] on the north of the brook, and its outgoings are at the  sea.</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS17_12" data-id="JS17_12">And the sons of Manasseh have not been able to occupy  these cities, and the Canaanite is desirous to dwell in this  land,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS17_13" data-id="JS17_13">and it cometh to pass when the sons of Israel have been  strong, that they put the Canaanite to tribute, and have not  utterly dispossessed him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS17_14" data-id="JS17_14">And the sons of Joseph speak with Joshua, saying,  `Wherefore hast thou given to me an inheritance -- one lot and  one portion, and I a numerous people? hitherto hath Jehovah  blessed me.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS17_17" data-id="JS17_17">And Joshua speaketh unto the house of Joseph, to Ephraim  and to Manasseh, saying, `Thou [art] a numerous people, and  hast great power; thou hast not one lot [only],</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS17_18" data-id="JS17_18">because the mountain is thine; because it [is] a forest --  thou hast prepared it, and its outgoings have been thine;  because thou dost dispossess the Canaanite, though it hath  chariots of iron -- though it [is] strong.'</span>
