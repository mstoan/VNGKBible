<div class="c">13</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_1" data-id="NH13_1">On that day there was read in the book of Moses, in the  ears of the people, and it hath been found written in it that  an Ammonite and Moabite doth not come into the assembly of God  -- unto the age,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_2" data-id="NH13_2">because they have not come before the sons of Israel with  bread and with water, and hire against them Balaam to revile  them, and our God turneth the reviling into a blessing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_3" data-id="NH13_3">And it cometh to pass, at their hearing the law, that they  separate all the mixed people from Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_4" data-id="NH13_4">And before this Eliashib the priest, appointed over  chambers of the house of our God, [is] a relation of Tobiah,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_5" data-id="NH13_5">and he maketh for him a great chamber, and there they were  formerly putting the present, the frankincense, and the  vessels, and the tithe of the corn, the new wine, and the oil  -- the commanded thing of the Levites, and the singers, and the  gatekeepers -- and the heave-offering of the priests.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_6" data-id="NH13_6">And during all this I was not in Jerusalem, for in the  thirty and second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon did I come  unto the king, and at the end of days I have asked of the king,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_7" data-id="NH13_7">and I come in to Jerusalem, and understand concerning the  evil that Eliashib hath done for Tobiah, to make to him a  chamber in the courts of the house of God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_8" data-id="NH13_8">and it is very displeasing to me, and I cast all the  vessels of the house of Tobiah without, out of the chamber,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_9" data-id="NH13_9">and I speak, and they cleanse the chambers, and I bring  back thither the vessels of the house of God with the present  and the frankincense.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_10" data-id="NH13_10">And I know that the portions of the Levites have not been  given, and they flee each to his field -- the Levites and the  singers, doing the work.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_11" data-id="NH13_11">And I strive with the prefects, and say, `Wherefore hath  the house of God been forsaken?' and I gather them, and set  them on their station;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_12" data-id="NH13_12">and all Judah have brought in the tithe of the corn, and  of the new wine, and of the oil, to the treasuries.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_13" data-id="NH13_13">And I appoint treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah  the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites;  and by their hand [is] Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah,  for stedfast they have been reckoned, and on them [it is] to  give a portion to their brethren.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_14" data-id="NH13_14">Be mindful of me, O my God, for this, and do not blot out  my kind acts that I have done, for the house of my God, and for  its charges.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_15" data-id="NH13_15">In those days I have seen in Judah those treading  wine-vats on sabbath, and bringing in the sheaves, and lading  on the asses, and also, wine, grapes, and figs, and every  burden, yea, they are bringing in to Jerusalem on the  sabbath-day, and I testify in the day of their selling  provision.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_16" data-id="NH13_16">And the Tyrians have dwelt in it, bringing in fish, and  every ware, and selling on sabbath to the sons of Judah and in  Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_17" data-id="NH13_17">And I strive with the freemen of Judah, and say to them,  `What [is] this evil thing that ye are doing, and polluting the  sabbath-day?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_18" data-id="NH13_18">Thus did not your fathers do? and our God bringeth in on  us all this evil, and on this city, and ye are adding  fierceness on Israel, to pollute the sabbath.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_19" data-id="NH13_19">And it cometh to pass, when the gates of Jerusalem have  been dark before the sabbath, that I speak, and the doors are  shut, and I say, that they do not open them till after the  sabbath; and of my servants I have stationed at the gates;  there doth not come in a burden on the sabbath-day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_20" data-id="NH13_20">And they lodge -- the merchants and sellers of all ware --  at the outside of Jerusalem, once or twice,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_21" data-id="NH13_21">and I testify against them, and say unto them, `Wherefore  are ye lodging over-against the wall? if ye repeat [it], a hand  I put forth upon you;' from that time they have not come in on  the sabbath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_22" data-id="NH13_22">And I say to the Levites, that they be cleansed, and,  coming in, keeping the gates, to sanctify the sabbath-day.  Also, this, remember for me, O my God, and have pity on me,  according to the abundance of Thy kindness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_23" data-id="NH13_23">Also, in those days, I have seen the Jews [who] have  settled women of Ashdod, of Ammon, of Moab.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_24" data-id="NH13_24">And of their sons, half are speaking Ashdoditish -- and  are not knowing to speak Jewish -- and according to the  language of people and people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_25" data-id="NH13_25">And I strive with them, and declare them vile, and smite  certain of them, and pluck off their hair, and cause them to  swear by God, `Ye do not give your daughters to their sons, nor  do ye take of their daughters to your sons, and to yourselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_26" data-id="NH13_26">`By these did not Solomon king of Israel sin? and among  the many nations there was no king like him, and beloved by his  God he was, and God maketh him king over all Israel -- even him  did the strange women cause to sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_27" data-id="NH13_27">And to you do we hearken to do all this great evil, to  trespass against our God, to settle strange women?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_28" data-id="NH13_28">And [one] of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib the high  priest, [is] son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite, and I cause  him to flee from off me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_29" data-id="NH13_29">Be mindful of them, O my God, for the redeemed of the  priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the  Levites.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_30" data-id="NH13_30">And I have cleansed them from every stranger, and appoint  charges to priests and to Levites, each in his work,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH13_31" data-id="NH13_31">and for the wood-offering at appointed times, and for  first-fruits. Be mindful of me, O my God, for good.</span>
