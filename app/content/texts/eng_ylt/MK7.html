<div class="c">7</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_1" data-id="MK7_1">And gathered together unto him are the Pharisees, and  certain of the scribes, having come from Jerusalem,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_2" data-id="MK7_2">and having seen certain of his disciples with defiled hands  -- that is, unwashed -- eating bread, they found fault;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_3" data-id="MK7_3">for the Pharisees, and all the Jews, if they do not wash the  hands to the wrist, do not eat, holding the tradition of the  elders,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_4" data-id="MK7_4">and, [coming] from the market-place, if they do not baptize  themselves, they do not eat; and many other things there are  that they received to hold, baptisms of cups, and pots, and  brazen vessels, and couches.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_5" data-id="MK7_5">Then question him do the Pharisees and the scribes,  `Wherefore do thy disciples not walk according to the  tradition of the elders, but with unwashed hands do eat the  bread?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_6" data-id="MK7_6">and he answering said to them -- `Well did Isaiah prophesy  concerning you, hypocrites, as it hath been written, This  people with the lips doth honor Me, and their heart is far from  Me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_7" data-id="MK7_7">and in vain do they worship Me, teaching teachings, commands  of men;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_8" data-id="MK7_8">for, having put away the command of God, ye hold the  tradition of men, baptisms of pots and cups; and many other  such like things ye do.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_9" data-id="MK7_9">And he said to them, `Well do ye put away the command of God  that your tradition ye may keep;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_10" data-id="MK7_10">for Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, He  who is speaking evil of father or mother -- let him die the  death;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_11" data-id="MK7_11">and ye say, If a man may say to father or to mother, Korban  (that is, a gift), [is] whatever thou mayest be profited out of  mine,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_12" data-id="MK7_12">and no more do ye suffer him to do anything for his father  or for his mother,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_13" data-id="MK7_13">setting aside the word of God for your tradition that ye  delivered; and many such like things ye do.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_14" data-id="MK7_14">And having called near all the multitude, he said to them,  `Hearken to me, ye all, and understand;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_15" data-id="MK7_15">there is nothing from without the man entering into him  that is able to defile him, but the things coming out from him,  those are the things defiling the man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_16" data-id="MK7_16">If any hath ears to hear -- let him hear.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_17" data-id="MK7_17">And when he entered into a house from the multitude, his  disciples were questioning him about the simile,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_18" data-id="MK7_18">and he saith to them, `So also ye are without  understanding! Do ye not perceive that nothing from without  entering into the man is able to defile him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_19" data-id="MK7_19">because it doth not enter into his heart, but into the  belly, and into the drain it doth go out, purifying all the  meats.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_20" data-id="MK7_20">And he said -- `That which is coming out from the man, that  doth defile the man;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_21" data-id="MK7_21">for from within, out of the heart of men, the evil  reasonings do come forth, adulteries, whoredoms, murders,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_22" data-id="MK7_22">thefts, covetous desires, wickedness, deceit, arrogance, an  evil eye, evil speaking, pride, foolishness;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_23" data-id="MK7_23">all these evils do come forth from within, and they defile  the man.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_24" data-id="MK7_24">And from thence having risen, he went away to the borders  of Tyre and Sidon, and having entered into the house, he  wished none to know, and he was not able to be hid,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_25" data-id="MK7_25">for a woman having heard about him, whose little daughter  had an unclean spirit, having come, fell at his feet, --</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_26" data-id="MK7_26">and the woman was a Greek, a Syro-Phenician by nation --  and was asking him, that the demon he may cast forth out of her  daughter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_27" data-id="MK7_27">And Jesus said to her, `Suffer first the children to be  filled, for it is not good to take the children's bread, and  to cast [it] to the little dogs.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_28" data-id="MK7_28">And she answered and saith to him, `Yes, sir; for the  little dogs also under the table do eat of the children's  crumbs.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_29" data-id="MK7_29">And he said to her, `Because of this word go; the demon  hath gone forth out of thy daughter;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_30" data-id="MK7_30">and having come away to her house, she found the demon gone  forth, and the daughter laid upon the couch.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_31" data-id="MK7_31">And again, having gone forth from the coasts of Tyre and  Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of  the coasts of Decapolis,</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_32" data-id="MK7_32">and they bring to him a deaf, stuttering man, and they call  on him that he may put the hand on him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_33" data-id="MK7_33">And having taken him away from the multitude by himself, he  put his fingers to his ears, and having spit, he touched his  tongue,</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_34" data-id="MK7_34">and having looked to the heaven, he sighed, and saith to  him, `Ephphatha,' that is, `Be thou opened;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_35" data-id="MK7_35">and immediately were his ears opened, and the string of his  tongue was loosed, and he was speaking plain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_36" data-id="MK7_36">And he charged them that they may tell no one, but the more  he was charging them, the more abundantly they were  proclaiming [it],</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_37" data-id="MK7_37">and they were being beyond measure astonished, saying,  `Well hath he done all things; both the deaf he doth make to  hear, and the dumb to speak.'</span>
