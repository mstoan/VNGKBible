<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_2" data-id="JN8_2">and all the people were coming unto him, and having sat  down, he was teaching them;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_3" data-id="JN8_3">and the scribes and the Pharisees bring unto him a woman  having been taken in adultery, and having set her in the  midst,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_4" data-id="JN8_4">they say to him, `Teacher, this woman was taken in the very  crime -- committing adultery,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_5" data-id="JN8_5">and in the law, Moses did command us that such be stoned;  thou, therefore, what dost thou say?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_6" data-id="JN8_6">and this they said, trying him, that they might have to  accuse him. And Jesus, having stooped down, with the finger he  was writing on the ground,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_7" data-id="JN8_7">and when they continued asking him, having bent himself  back, he said unto them, `The sinless of you -- let him first  cast the stone at her;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_8" data-id="JN8_8">and again having stooped down, he was writing on the ground,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_9" data-id="JN8_9">and they having heard, and by the conscience being  convicted, were going forth one by one, having begun from the  elders -- unto the last; and Jesus was left alone, and the  woman standing in the midst.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_10" data-id="JN8_10">And Jesus having bent himself back, and having seen no one  but the woman, said to her, `Woman, where are those -- thine  accusers? did no one pass sentence upon thee?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_11" data-id="JN8_11">and she said, `No one, Sir;' and Jesus said to her,  `Neither do I pass sentence on thee; be going on, and no more  sin.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_12" data-id="JN8_12">Again, therefore, Jesus spake to them, saying, `I am the  light of the world; he who is following me shall not walk in  the darkness, but he shall have the light of the life.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_13" data-id="JN8_13">The Pharisees, therefore, said to him, `Thou of thyself  dost testify, thy testimony is not true;'</span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_22" data-id="JN8_22">The Jews, therefore, said, `Will he kill himself, because  he saith, Whither I go away, ye are not able to come?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_23" data-id="JN8_23">and he said to them, `Ye are from beneath, I am from above;  ye are of this world, I am not of this world;</span>

<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_25" data-id="JN8_25">They said, therefore, to him, `Thou -- who art thou?' and  Jesus said to them, `Even what I did speak of to you at the  beginning;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_26" data-id="JN8_26">many things I have to speak concerning you and to judge,  but He who sent me is true, and I -- what things I heard from  Him -- these I say to the world.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_29" data-id="JN8_29">and He who sent me is with me; the Father did not leave me  alone, because I, the things pleasing to Him, do always.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_30" data-id="JN8_30">As he is speaking these things, many believed in him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_31" data-id="JN8_31">Jesus, therefore, said unto the Jews who believed in him,  `If ye may remain in my word, truly my disciples ye are, and  ye shall know the truth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_32" data-id="JN8_32">and the truth shall make you free.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_33" data-id="JN8_33">They answered him, `Seed of Abraham we are; and to no one  have we been servants at any time; how dost thou say -- Ye  shall become free?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_34" data-id="JN8_34">Jesus answered them, `Verily, verily, I say to you -- Every  one who is committing sin, is a servant of the sin,</span>

<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_39" data-id="JN8_39">They answered and said to him, `Our father is Abraham;'  Jesus saith to them, `If children of Abraham ye were, the  works of Abraham ye were doing;</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_40" data-id="JN8_40">and now, ye seek to kill me -- a man who hath spoken to you  the truth I heard from God; this Abraham did not;</span>
