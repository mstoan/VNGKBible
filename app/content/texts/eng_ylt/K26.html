<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_28" data-id="K26_28">And the king saith to her, `What -- to thee?' and she  saith, `This woman said unto me, Give thy son, and we eat him  to-day, and my son we eat to-morrow;</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_29" data-id="K26_29">and we boil my son and eat him, and I say unto her on the  next day, Give thy son, and we eat him; and she hideth her  son.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_30" data-id="K26_30">And it cometh to pass, at the king's hearing the words of  the woman, that he rendeth his garments, and he is passing by  on the wall, and the people see, and lo, the sackcloth [is] on  his flesh within.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v K26_31" data-id="K26_31">And he saith, `Thus doth God do to me, and thus He doth add  -- if it remain -- the head of Elisha son of Shaphat -- upon  him this day.'</span>
