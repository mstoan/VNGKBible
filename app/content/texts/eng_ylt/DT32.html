<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_2" data-id="DT32_2">Drop as rain doth My doctrine; Flow as dew doth My sayings;  As storms on the tender grass, And as showers on the herb,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_3" data-id="DT32_3">For the Name of Jehovah I proclaim, Ascribe ye greatness to  our God!</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_4" data-id="DT32_4">The Rock! -- perfect [is] His work, For all His ways [are]  just; God of stedfastness, and without iniquity: Righteous and  upright [is] He.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_5" data-id="DT32_5">It hath done corruptly to Him; Their blemish is not His  sons', A generation perverse and crooked!</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_6" data-id="DT32_6">To Jehovah do ye act thus, O people foolish and not wise?  Is not He thy father -- thy possessor? He made thee, and doth  establish thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_7" data-id="DT32_7">Remember days of old -- Understand the years of many  generations -- Ask thy father, and he doth tell thee; Thine  elders, and they say to thee:</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_9" data-id="DT32_9">For Jehovah's portion [is] His people, Jacob [is] the line  of His inheritance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_10" data-id="DT32_10">He findeth him in a land -- a desert, And in a void -- a  howling wilderness, He turneth him round -- He causeth him to  understand -- He keepeth him as the apple of His eye.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_11" data-id="DT32_11">As an eagle waketh up its nest, Over its young ones  fluttereth, Spreadeth its wings -- taketh them, Beareth them on  its pinions; --</span>

<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_20" data-id="DT32_20">And He saith: I hide My face from them, I see what [is]  their latter end; For a froward generation [are] they, Sons in  whom is no stedfastness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_21" data-id="DT32_21">They have made Me zealous by `no-god,' They made Me angry  by their vanities; And I make them zealous by `no-people,' By a  foolish nation I make them angry.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_22" data-id="DT32_22">For a fire hath been kindled in Mine anger, And it burneth  unto Sheol -- the lowest, And consumeth earth and its increase,  And setteth on fire foundations of mountains.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_23" data-id="DT32_23">I gather upon them evils, Mine arrows I consume upon them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_24" data-id="DT32_24">Exhausted by famine, And consumed by heat, and bitter  destruction. And the teeth of beasts I send upon them, With  poison of fearful things of the dust.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_25" data-id="DT32_25">Without bereave doth the sword, And at the inner-chambers  -- fear, Both youth and virgin, Suckling with man of grey hair.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_26" data-id="DT32_26">I have said: I blow them away, I cause their remembrance  to cease from man;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_27" data-id="DT32_27">If not -- the anger of an enemy I fear, Lest their  adversaries know -- Lest they say, Our hand is high, And  Jehovah hath not wrought all this.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_28" data-id="DT32_28">For a nation lost to counsels [are] they, And there is no  understanding in them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_29" data-id="DT32_29">If they were wise -- They deal wisely [with] this; They  attend to their latter end:</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_30" data-id="DT32_30">How doth one pursue a thousand, And two cause a myriad to  flee! If not -- that their rock hath sold them, And Jehovah  hath shut them up?</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_31" data-id="DT32_31">For not as our Rock [is] their rock, (And our enemies  [are] judges!)</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_32" data-id="DT32_32">For of the vine of Sodom their vine [is], And of the  fields of Gomorrah; Their grapes [are] grapes of gall -- They  have bitter clusters;</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_33" data-id="DT32_33">The poison of dragons [is] their wine And the fierce venom  of asps.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_34" data-id="DT32_34">Is it not laid up with Me? Sealed among My treasures?</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_35" data-id="DT32_35">Mine [are] vengeance and recompense, At the due time --  doth their foot slide; For near is a day of their calamity, And  haste do things prepared for them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_36" data-id="DT32_36">For Jehovah doth judge His people, And for His servants  doth repent Himself. For He seeth -- the going away of power,  And none is restrained and left.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_37" data-id="DT32_37">And He hath said, Where [are] their gods -- The rock in  which they trusted;</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_38" data-id="DT32_38">Which the fat of their sacrifices do eat, They drink the  wine of their libation! Let them arise and help you, Let it be  for you a hiding-place!</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_39" data-id="DT32_39">See ye, now, that I -- I [am] He, And there is no god with  Me: I put to death, and I keep alive; I have smitten, and I  heal; And there is not from My hand a deliverer,</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_40" data-id="DT32_40">For I lift up unto the heavens My hand, And have said, I  live -- to the age!</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_41" data-id="DT32_41">If I have sharpened the brightness of My sword, And My  hand doth lay hold on judgment, I turn back vengeance to Mine  adversaries, And to those hating Me -- I repay!</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_42" data-id="DT32_42">I make drunk Mine arrows with blood, And My sword  devoureth flesh, From the blood of the pierced and captive,  From the head of the freemen of the enemy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_43" data-id="DT32_43">Sing ye nations -- [with] his people, For the blood of His  servants He avengeth, And vengeance He turneth back on His  adversaries, And hath pardoned His land -- His people.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_44" data-id="DT32_44">And Moses cometh and speaketh all the words of this song  in the ears of the people, he and Hoshea son of Nun;</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_45" data-id="DT32_45">and Moses finisheth to speak all these words unto all  Israel,</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_46" data-id="DT32_46">and saith unto them, `Set your heart to all the words  which I am testifying against you to-day, that ye command your  sons to observe to do all the words of this law,</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_47" data-id="DT32_47">for it [is] not a vain thing for you, for it [is] your  life, and by this thing ye prolong days on the ground whither  ye are passing over the Jordan to possess it.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_48" data-id="DT32_48">And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, in this self-same day,  saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_49" data-id="DT32_49">`Go up unto this mount Abarim, mount Nebo, which [is] in  the land of Moab, which [is] on the front of Jericho, and see  the land of Canaan which I am giving to the sons of Israel for  a possession;</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT32_50" data-id="DT32_50">and die in the mount whither thou art going up, and be  gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother hath died in the  mount Hor, and is gathered unto his people:</span>
