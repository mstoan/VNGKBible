<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB42_8" data-id="JB42_8">And now, take to you seven bullocks and seven rams, and go  ye unto My servant Job, and ye have caused a burnt-offering to  ascend for you; and Job My servant doth pray for you, for  surely his face I accept, so as not to do with you folly,  because ye have not spoken concerning Me rightly, like My  servant Job.</span>
