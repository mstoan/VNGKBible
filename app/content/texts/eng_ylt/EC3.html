<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_10" data-id="EC3_10">I have seen the travail that God hath given to the sons of  man to be humbled by it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_11" data-id="EC3_11">The whole He hath made beautiful in its season; also, that  knowledge He hath put in their heart without which man findeth  not out the work that God hath done from the beginning even  unto the end.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_12" data-id="EC3_12">I have known that there is no good for them except to  rejoice and to do good during their life,</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_15" data-id="EC3_15">What is that which hath been? already it is, and that which  [is] to be hath already been, and God requireth that which is  pursued.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_16" data-id="EC3_16">And again, I have seen under the sun the place of judgment  -- there [is] the wicked; and the place of righteousness --  there [is] the wicked.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_17" data-id="EC3_17">I said in my heart, `The righteous and the wicked doth God  judge, for a time [is] to every matter and for every work  there.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_18" data-id="EC3_18">I said in my heart concerning the matter of the sons of man  that God might cleanse them, so as to see that they themselves  [are] beasts.</span>
