<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_2" data-id="RM12_2">and be not conformed to this age, but be transformed by the  renewing of your mind, for your proving what [is] the will of  God -- the good, and acceptable, and perfect.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_3" data-id="RM12_3">For I say, through the grace that was given to me, to every  one who is among you, not to think above what it behoveth to  think; but to think so as to think wisely, as to each God did  deal a measure of faith,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_4" data-id="RM12_4">for as in one body we have many members, and all the  members have not the same office,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_5" data-id="RM12_5">so we, the many, one body are in Christ, and members each  one of one another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_6" data-id="RM12_6">And having gifts, different according to the grace that was  given to us; whether prophecy -- `According to the proportion  of faith!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_7" data-id="RM12_7">or ministration -- `In the ministration!' or he who is  teaching -- `In the teaching!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_8" data-id="RM12_8">or he who is exhorting -- `In the exhortation!' he who is  sharing -- `In simplicity!' he who is leading -- `In  diligence?' he who is doing kindness -- `In cheerfulness.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_9" data-id="RM12_9">The love unfeigned: abhorring the evil; cleaving to the  good;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_10" data-id="RM12_10">in the love of brethren, to one another kindly  affectioned: in the honour going before one another;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_11" data-id="RM12_11">in the diligence not slothful; in the spirit fervent; the  Lord serving;</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_15" data-id="RM12_15">to rejoice with the rejoicing, and to weep with the  weeping,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_16" data-id="RM12_16">of the same mind one toward another, not minding the high  things, but with the lowly going along; become not wise in  your own conceit;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_17" data-id="RM12_17">giving back to no one evil for evil; providing right  things before all men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_18" data-id="RM12_18">If possible -- so far as in you -- with all men being in  peace;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_19" data-id="RM12_19">not avenging yourselves, beloved, but give place to the  wrath, for it hath been written, `Vengeance [is] Mine,</span>
