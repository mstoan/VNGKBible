<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_2" data-id="GN19_2">and he saith, `Lo, I pray you, my lords, turn aside, I pray  you, unto the house of your servant, and lodge, and wash your  feet -- then ye have risen early and gone on your way;' and  they say, `Nay, but in the broad place we do lodge.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_3" data-id="GN19_3">And he presseth on them greatly, and they turn aside unto  him, and come in unto his house; and he maketh for them a  banquet, and hath baked unleavened things; and they do eat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_4" data-id="GN19_4">Before they lie down, the men of the city -- men of Sodom  -- have come round about against the house, from young even  unto aged, all the people from the extremity;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_5" data-id="GN19_5">and they call unto Lot and say to him, `Where [are] the men  who have come in unto thee to-night? bring them out unto us,  and we know them.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_6" data-id="GN19_6">And Lot goeth out unto them, to the opening, and the door  hath shut behind him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_7" data-id="GN19_7">and saith, `Do not, I pray you, my brethren, do evil;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_8" data-id="GN19_8">lo, I pray you, I have two daughters, who have not known  any one; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do to  them as [is] good in your eyes; only to these men do not  anything, for therefore have they come in within the shadow of  my roof.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_9" data-id="GN19_9">And they say, `Come nigh hither;' they say also, `This one  hath come in to sojourn, and he certainly judgeth! now, we do  evil to thee more than [to] them;' and they press against the  man, against Lot greatly, and come nigh to break the door.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_10" data-id="GN19_10">And the men put forth their hand, and bring in Lot unto  them, into the house, and have shut the door;</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_12" data-id="GN19_12">And the men say unto Lot, `Whom hast thou here still?  son-in-law, thy sons also, and thy daughters, and all whom thou  hast in the city, bring out from this place;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_13" data-id="GN19_13">for we are destroying this place, for their cry hath been  great [before] the face of Jehovah, and Jehovah doth send us to  destroy it.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_14" data-id="GN19_14">And Lot goeth out, and speaketh unto his sons-in-law,  those taking his daughters, and saith, `Rise, go out from this  place, for Jehovah is destroying the city;' and he is as [one]  mocking in the eyes of his sons-in-law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_15" data-id="GN19_15">And when the dawn hath ascended, then the messengers press  upon Lot, saying, `Rise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters  who are found present, lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of  the city.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_17" data-id="GN19_17">And it cometh to pass when he hath brought them out  without, that he saith, `Escape for thy life; look not  expectingly behind thee, nor stand thou in all the circuit; to  the mountain escape, lest thou be consumed.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_18" data-id="GN19_18">And Lot saith unto them, `Not [so], I pray thee, my lord;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_19" data-id="GN19_19">lo, I pray thee, thy servant hath found grace in thine  eyes, and thou dost make great thy kindness which thou hast  done with me by saving my life, and I am unable to escape to  the mountain, lest the evil cleave [to] me, and I have died;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_20" data-id="GN19_20">lo, I pray thee, this city [is] near to flee thither, and  it [is] little; let me escape, I pray thee, thither, (is it not  little?) and my soul doth live.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_21" data-id="GN19_21">And he saith unto him, `Lo, I have accepted thy face also  for this thing, without overthrowing the city [for] which thou  hast spoken;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_22" data-id="GN19_22">haste, escape thither, for I am not able to do anything  till thine entering thither;' therefore hath he calleth the  name of the city Zoar.</span>

<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_24" data-id="GN19_24">and Jehovah hath rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah  brimstone and fire from Jehovah, from the heavens;</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_25" data-id="GN19_25">and He overthroweth these cities, and all the circuit, and  all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which is shooting  up from the ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_26" data-id="GN19_26">And his wife looketh expectingly from behind him, and she  is -- a pillar of salt!</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_27" data-id="GN19_27">And Abraham riseth early in the morning, unto the place  where he hath stood [before] the face of Jehovah;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_28" data-id="GN19_28">and he looketh on the face of Sodom and Gomorrah, and on  all the face of the land of the circuit, and seeth, and lo, the  smoke of the land went up as smoke of the furnace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_29" data-id="GN19_29">And it cometh to pass, in God's destroying the cities of  the circuit, that God remembereth Abraham, and sendeth Lot out  of the midst of the overthrow in the overthrowing of the cities  in which Lot dwelt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_30" data-id="GN19_30">And Lot goeth up out of Zoar, and dwelleth in the  mountain, and his two daughters with him, for he hath been  afraid of dwelling in Zoar, and he dwelleth in a cave, he and  his two daughters.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_31" data-id="GN19_31">And the first-born saith unto the younger, `Our father  [is] old, and a man there is not in the earth to come in unto  us, as [is] the way of all the earth;</span>
