<div class="c">5</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_1" data-id="RV5_1">And I saw upon the right hand of Him who is sitting upon the  throne a scroll, written within and on the back, sealed with  seven seals;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_2" data-id="RV5_2">and I saw a strong messenger crying with a great voice, `Who  is worthy to open the scroll and to loose the seals of it?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_3" data-id="RV5_3">and no one was able in the heaven, nor upon the earth, nor  under the earth, to open the scroll, nor to behold it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_4" data-id="RV5_4">And I was weeping much, because no one was found worthy to  open and to read the scroll, nor to behold it,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_5" data-id="RV5_5">and one of the elders saith to me, `Weep not; lo, overcome  did the Lion, who is of the tribe of Judah, the root of David,  to open the scroll, and to loose the seven seals of it;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_6" data-id="RV5_6">and I saw, and lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the  four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb  hath stood as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven  eyes, which are the Seven Spirits of God, which are sent to all  the earth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_7" data-id="RV5_7">and he came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him  who is sitting upon the throne.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_8" data-id="RV5_8">And when he took the scroll, the four living creatures and  the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, having each one  harps and golden vials full of perfumes, which are the prayers  of the saints,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_9" data-id="RV5_9">and they sing a new song, saying, `Worthy art thou to take  the scroll, and to open the seals of it, because thou wast  slain, and didst redeem us to God in thy blood, out of every  tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_10" data-id="RV5_10">and didst make us to our God kings and priests, and we  shall reign upon the earth.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_11" data-id="RV5_11">And I saw, and I heard the voice of many messengers round  the throne, and the living creatures, and the elders -- and the  number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of  thousands --</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_12" data-id="RV5_12">saying with a great voice, `Worthy is the Lamb that was  slain to receive the power, and riches, and wisdom, and  strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_13" data-id="RV5_13">and every creature that is in the heaven, and in the earth,  and under the earth, and the things that are upon the sea, and  the all things in them, heard I saying, `To Him who is sitting  upon the throne, and to the Lamb, [is] the blessing, and the  honour, and the glory, and the might -- to the ages of the  ages!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_14" data-id="RV5_14">and the four living creatures said, `Amen!' and the  twenty-four elders fell down and they bow before Him who is  living to the ages of the ages.</span>
