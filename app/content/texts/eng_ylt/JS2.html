<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS2_2" data-id="JS2_2">And it is told to the king of Jericho, saying, `Lo, men have  come in hither to-night, from the sons of Israel, to search the  land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS2_3" data-id="JS2_3">And the king of Jericho sendeth unto Rahab, saying, `Bring  out the men who are coming in unto thee, who have come into thy  house, for to search the whole of the land they have come in.</span>

<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS2_6" data-id="JS2_6">and she hath caused them to go up on the roof, and hideth  them with the flax wood, which is arranged for her on the roof.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS2_7" data-id="JS2_7">And the men have pursued after them the way of the Jordan,  by the fords, and the gate they have shut afterwards, when the  pursuers have gone out after them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS2_8" data-id="JS2_8">And -- before they lie down -- she hath gone up unto them on  the roof,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS2_9" data-id="JS2_9">and she saith unto the men, `I have known that Jehovah hath  given to you the land, and that your terror hath fallen upon  us, and that all the inhabitants of the land have melted at  your presence.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS2_10" data-id="JS2_10">`For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the waters of the  Red Sea at your presence, in your going out of Egypt, and that  which ye have done to the two kings of the Amorite who [are]  beyond the Jordan; to Sihon and to Og whom ye devoted.</span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS2_13" data-id="JS2_13">and have kept alive my father, and my mother, and my  brothers, and my sisters, and all that they have, and have  delivered our souls from death.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS2_19" data-id="JS2_19">and it hath been, any one who goeth out from the doors of  thy house without, his blood [is] on his head, and we are  innocent; and any one who is with thee in the house, his blood  [is] on our head, if a hand is on him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS2_20" data-id="JS2_20">and if thou declare this our matter, then we have been  acquitted from thine oath which thou hast caused us to swear.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS2_22" data-id="JS2_22">And they go, and come in to the mountain, and abide there  three days until the pursuers have turned back; and the  pursuers seek in all the way, and have not found.</span>
