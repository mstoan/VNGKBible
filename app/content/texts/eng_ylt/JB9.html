<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_3" data-id="JB9_3">If he delight to strive with Him -- He doth not answer him  one of a thousand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_4" data-id="JB9_4">Wise in heart and strong in power -- Who hath hardened  toward Him and is at peace?</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_7" data-id="JB9_7">Who is speaking to the sun, and it riseth not, And the stars  He sealeth up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_8" data-id="JB9_8">Stretching out the heavens by Himself, And treading on the  heights of the sea,</span>

<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_30" data-id="JB9_30">If I have washed myself with snow-water, And purified with  soap my hands,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_31" data-id="JB9_31">Then in corruption Thou dost dip me, And my garments have  abominated me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_32" data-id="JB9_32">But if a man like myself -- I answer him, We come together  into judgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_33" data-id="JB9_33">If there were between us an umpire, He doth place his hand  on us both.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_34" data-id="JB9_34">He doth turn aside from off me his rod, And His terror doth  not make me afraid,</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB9_35" data-id="JB9_35">I speak, and do not fear Him, But I am not right with  myself.</span>
