<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS9_2" data-id="JS9_2">that they gather themselves together to fight with Joshua,  and with Israel -- one mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS9_3" data-id="JS9_3">And the inhabitants of Gibeon have heard that which Joshua  hath done to Jericho and to Ai,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS9_4" data-id="JS9_4">and they work, even they, with subtilty, and go, and feign  to be ambassadors, and take old sacks for their asses, and  wine-bottles, old, and rent, and bound up,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS9_5" data-id="JS9_5">and sandals, old and patched, on their feet, and old  garments upon them, and all the bread of their provision is dry  -- it was crumbs.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS9_6" data-id="JS9_6">And they go unto Joshua, unto the camp at Gilgal, and say  unto him, and unto the men of Israel, `From a land far off we  have come, and now, make with us a covenant;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS9_7" data-id="JS9_7">and the men of Israel say unto the Hivite, `It may be in our  midst ye are dwelling, and how do we make with thee a  covenant?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS9_8" data-id="JS9_8">and they say unto Joshua, `Thy servants we [are].' And  Joshua saith unto them, `Who [are] ye? and whence come ye?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS9_9" data-id="JS9_9">And they say unto him, `From a land very far off have thy  servants come, for the name of Jehovah thy God, for we have  heard His fame, and all that He hath done in Egypt,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS9_10" data-id="JS9_10">and all that He hath done to the two kings of the Amorite  who [are] beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to  Og king of Bashan, who [is] in Ashtaroth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS9_11" data-id="JS9_11">`And our elders, and all the inhabitants of our land speak  unto us, saying, Take in your hand provision for the way, and  go to meet them, and ye have said unto them, Your servants we  [are], and now, make with us a covenant;</span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS9_13" data-id="JS9_13">and these [are] the wine-bottles which we filled, new, and  lo, they have rent; and these, our garments and our sandals,  have become old, from the exceeding greatness of the way.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS9_14" data-id="JS9_14">And the men take of their provision, and the mouth of  Jehovah have not asked;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS9_15" data-id="JS9_15">and Joshua maketh with them peace, and maketh with them a  covenant, to keep them alive; and swear to them do the princes  of the company.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS9_16" data-id="JS9_16">And it cometh to pass, at the end of three days after that  they have made with them a covenant, that they hear that they  [are] their neighbours -- that in their midst they are  dwelling.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS9_17" data-id="JS9_17">And the sons of Israel journey and come in unto their  cities on the third day -- and their cities [are] Gibeon, and  Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath-Jearim --</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS9_18" data-id="JS9_18">and the sons of Israel have not smitten them, for sworn to  them have the princes of the company by Jehovah God of Israel,  and all the company murmur against the princes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS9_19" data-id="JS9_19">And all the princes say unto all the company, `We -- we  have sworn to them by Jehovah, God of Israel; and now, we are  not able to come against them;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS9_20" data-id="JS9_20">this we do to them, and have kept them alive, and wrath is  not upon us, because of the oath which we have sworn to them.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS9_21" data-id="JS9_21">And the princes say unto them, `They live, and are hewers  of wood and drawers of water for all the company, as the  princes spake to them.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS9_22" data-id="JS9_22">And Joshua calleth for them, and speaketh unto them,  saying, `Why have ye deceived us, saying, We are very far from  you, and ye in our midst dwelling?</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS9_23" data-id="JS9_23">and now, cursed are ye, and none of you is cut off [from  being] a servant, even hewers of wood and drawers of water, for  the house of my God.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS9_24" data-id="JS9_24">And they answer Joshua and say, `Because it was certainly  declared to thy servants, that Jehovah thy God commanded Moses  His servant to give to you all the land, and to destroy all the  inhabitants of the land from before you; and we fear greatly  for ourselves because of you, and we do this thing;</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS9_25" data-id="JS9_25">and now, lo, we [are] in thy hand, as [it is] good, and as  [it is] right in thine eyes to do to us -- do.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS9_26" data-id="JS9_26">And he doth to them so, and delivereth them from the hand  of the sons of Israel, and they have not slain them;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS9_27" data-id="JS9_27">and Joshua maketh them on that day hewers of wood and  drawers of water for the company, and for the altar of Jehovah,  unto this day, at the place which He doth choose.</span>
