<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_2" data-id="PR1_2">For knowing wisdom and instruction, For understanding  sayings of intelligence,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_3" data-id="PR1_3">For receiving the instruction of wisdom, Righteousness,  judgment, and uprightness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_4" data-id="PR1_4">For giving to simple ones -- prudence, To a youth --  knowledge and discretion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_5" data-id="PR1_5">(The wise doth hear and increaseth learning, And the  intelligent doth obtain counsels.)</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_6" data-id="PR1_6">For understanding a proverb and its sweetness, Words of the  wise and their acute sayings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_7" data-id="PR1_7">Fear of Jehovah [is] a beginning of knowledge, Wisdom and  instruction fools have despised!</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_8" data-id="PR1_8">Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, And leave not  the law of thy mother,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_9" data-id="PR1_9">For a graceful wreath [are] they to thy head, And chains to  thy neck.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_10" data-id="PR1_10">My son, if sinners entice thee be not willing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_11" data-id="PR1_11">If they say, `Come with us, we lay wait for blood, We watch  secretly for the innocent without cause,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_12" data-id="PR1_12">We swallow them as Sheol -- alive, And whole -- as those  going down [to] the pit,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_13" data-id="PR1_13">Every precious substance we find, We fill our houses [with]  spoil,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_14" data-id="PR1_14">Thy lot thou dost cast among us, One purse is -- to all of  us.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_16" data-id="PR1_16">For their feet to evil do run, And they haste to shed  blood.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_17" data-id="PR1_17">Surely in vain is the net spread out before the eyes of any  bird.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_18" data-id="PR1_18">And they for their own blood lay wait, They watch secretly  for their own lives.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_19" data-id="PR1_19">So [are] the paths of every gainer of dishonest gain, The  life of its owners it taketh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_20" data-id="PR1_20">Wisdom in an out-place crieth aloud, In broad places she  giveth forth her voice,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_21" data-id="PR1_21">At the head of the multitudes she calleth, In the openings  of the gates, In the city her sayings she saith:</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_22" data-id="PR1_22">`Till when, ye simple, do ye love simplicity? And have  scorners their scorning desired? And do fools hate knowledge?</span>

<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_24" data-id="PR1_24">Because I have called, and ye refuse, I stretched out my  hand, and none is attending,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_25" data-id="PR1_25">And ye slight all my counsel, And my reproof ye have not  desired.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_26" data-id="PR1_26">I also in your calamity do laugh, I deride when your fear  cometh,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_27" data-id="PR1_27">When your fear cometh as destruction, And your calamity as  a hurricane doth come, When on you come adversity and distress.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_28" data-id="PR1_28">Then they call me, and I do not answer, They seek me  earnestly, and find me not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_29" data-id="PR1_29">Because that they have hated knowledge, And the fear of  Jehovah have not chosen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_30" data-id="PR1_30">They have not consented to my counsel, They have despised  all my reproof,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_31" data-id="PR1_31">And they eat of the fruit of their way, And from their own  counsels they are filled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_32" data-id="PR1_32">For the turning of the simple slayeth them, And the  security of the foolish destroyeth them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v PR1_33" data-id="PR1_33">And whoso is hearkening to me dwelleth confidently, And  [is] quiet from fear of evil!'</span>
