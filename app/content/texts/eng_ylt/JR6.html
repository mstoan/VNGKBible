<div class="c">6</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_1" data-id="JR6_1">Strengthen yourselves, sons of Benjamin, From the midst of  Jerusalem, And in Tekoa blow ye a trumpet, And over  Beth-Haccerem lift ye up a flame, For evil hath been seen from  the north, And great destruction.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_2" data-id="JR6_2">The comely and the delicate one I have cut off, The daughter  of Zion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_3" data-id="JR6_3">Unto her come do shepherds and their droves, They have  stricken tents by her round about, They have fed each [in] his  own station.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_4" data-id="JR6_4">Sanctify ye against her the battle, Rise, and we go up at  noon. Wo to us, for turned hath the day, For stretched out are  the shades of evening,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_5" data-id="JR6_5">`Rise, and we go up by night, And we destroy her palaces.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_6" data-id="JR6_6">For thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Cut down her wood, And pour  out against Jerusalem a mount, She [is] the city to be  inspected, Wholly -- she is oppression in her midst.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_7" data-id="JR6_7">As the digging of a well, is [for] its waters, So she hath  digged [for] her wickedness, Violence and spoil is heard in  her, Before My face continually [are] sickness and smiting.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_8" data-id="JR6_8">Be instructed, O Jerusalem, Lest My soul be alienated from  thee, Lest I make thee a desolation, a land not inhabited.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_9" data-id="JR6_9">Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: They surely glean, as a vine,  the remnant of Israel, Put back thy hand, as a gatherer to the  baskets.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_10" data-id="JR6_10">To whom do I speak, and testify, and they hear? Lo, their  ear [is] uncircumcised, And they are not able to attend. Lo, a  word of Jehovah hath been to them for a reproach, They delight  not in it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_11" data-id="JR6_11">And with the fury of Jehovah I have been filled, (I have  been weary of containing,) To pour [it] on the suckling in the  street, And on the assembly of youths together, For even  husband with wife are captured, An elder with one full of days,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_12" data-id="JR6_12">And their houses have been turned to others, Fields and  wives together, For I stretch out My hand against the  inhabitants of the land, An affirmation of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_13" data-id="JR6_13">For from their least unto their greatest, Every one is  gaining dishonest gain, And from prophet even unto priest,  Every one is dealing falsely,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_14" data-id="JR6_14">And they heal the breach of the daughter of my people  slightly, Saying, `Peace, peace!' and there is no peace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_15" data-id="JR6_15">They were ashamed when they did abomination! Yea, they are  not at all ashamed, Yea, blushing they have not known,  Therefore they do fall among those falling, In the time I have  inspected them, They stumble, said Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_16" data-id="JR6_16">Thus said Jehovah: Stand ye by the ways and see, and ask  for paths of old, Where [is] this -- the good way? and go ye in  it, And find rest for yourselves. And they say, `We do not go.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_17" data-id="JR6_17">And I have raised up for you watchmen, Attend ye to the  voice of the trumpet. And they say, `We do not attend.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_18" data-id="JR6_18">Therefore hear, O nations, and know, O company, That which  [is] upon them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_19" data-id="JR6_19">Hear, O earth, lo, I am bringing evil on this people, The  fruit of their devices, For to My words they gave no attention,  And My law -- they kick against it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_20" data-id="JR6_20">Why [is] this to Me? frankincense from Sheba cometh, And  the sweet cane from a land afar off, Your burnt-offerings [are]  not for acceptance, And your sacrifices have not been sweet to  Me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_21" data-id="JR6_21">Therefore thus said Jehovah: Lo, I do give to this people  stumbling blocks, And stumbled against them have fathers and  sons together, The neighbour and his friend do perish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_22" data-id="JR6_22">Thus said Jehovah: Lo, a people hath come from a north  country, And a great nation is stirred up from the sides of the  earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_23" data-id="JR6_23">Bow and javelin they take hold of, Fierce it [is], and they  have no mercy, Their voice as a sea doth sound, And on horses  they ride, set in array as a man of war, Against thee, O  daughter of Zion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_24" data-id="JR6_24">`We have heard its sound, feeble have been our hands,  Distress hath seized us, pain as of a travailing woman.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_25" data-id="JR6_25">Go not forth to the field, And in the way walk not, For a  sword hath the enemy, fear [is] round about.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_26" data-id="JR6_26">O daughter of My people, Gird on sackcloth, and roll  thyself in ashes, The mourning of an only one make for thee, A  lamentation most bitter, For suddenly come doth the spoiler  against us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_27" data-id="JR6_27">A watch-tower I have given thee, Among My people a  fortress, And thou knowest, and hast tried their way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_28" data-id="JR6_28">All of them are turned aside by apostates, Walking  slanderously -- brass and iron, All of them are corrupters.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_29" data-id="JR6_29">The bellows have been burnt, By fire hath the lead been  consumed, In vain hath a refiner refined, And the wicked have  not been drawn away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_30" data-id="JR6_30">`Silver rejected,' they have called to them, For Jehovah  hath kicked against them!</span>
