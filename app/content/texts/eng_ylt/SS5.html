<div class="c">5</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_1" data-id="SS5_1">I have come in to my garden, my sister-spouse, I have  plucked my myrrh with my spice, I have eaten my comb with my  honey, I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends,  drink, Yea, drink abundantly, O beloved ones!</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_2" data-id="SS5_2">I am sleeping, but my heart waketh: The sound of my beloved  knocking! `Open to me, my sister, my friend, My dove, my  perfect one, For my head is filled [with] dew, My locks [with]  drops of the night.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_3" data-id="SS5_3">I have put off my coat, how do I put it on? I have washed my  feet, how do I defile them?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_4" data-id="SS5_4">My beloved sent his hand from the net-work, And my bowels  were moved for him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_5" data-id="SS5_5">I rose to open to my beloved, And my hands dropped myrrh,  Yea, my fingers flowing myrrh, On the handles of the lock.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_6" data-id="SS5_6">I opened to my beloved, But my beloved withdrew -- he passed  on, My soul went forth when he spake, I sought him, and found  him not. I called him, and he answered me not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_7" data-id="SS5_7">The watchmen who go round about the city, Found me, smote  me, wounded me, Keepers of the walls lifted up my veil from off  me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_8" data-id="SS5_8">I have adjured you, daughters of Jerusalem, If ye find my  beloved -- What do ye tell him? that I [am] sick with love!</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_9" data-id="SS5_9">What [is] thy beloved above [any] beloved, O fair among  women? What [is] thy beloved above [any] beloved, That thus  thou hast adjured us?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_10" data-id="SS5_10">My beloved [is] clear and ruddy, Conspicuous above a  myriad!</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_11" data-id="SS5_11">His head [is] pure gold -- fine gold, His locks flowing,  dark as a raven,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_12" data-id="SS5_12">His eyes as doves by streams of water, Washing in milk,  sitting in fulness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_13" data-id="SS5_13">His cheeks as a bed of the spice, towers of perfumes, His  lips [are] lilies, dropping flowing myrrh,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_14" data-id="SS5_14">His hands rings of gold, set with beryl, His heart bright  ivory, covered with sapphires,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_15" data-id="SS5_15">His limbs pillars of marble, Founded on sockets of fine  gold, His appearance as Lebanon, choice as the cedars.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS5_16" data-id="SS5_16">His mouth is sweetness -- and all of him desirable, This  [is] my beloved, and this my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem!</span>
