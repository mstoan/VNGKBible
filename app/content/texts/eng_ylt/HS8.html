<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_2" data-id="HS8_2">To Me they cry, `My God, we -- Israel -- have known Thee.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_3" data-id="HS8_3">Cast off good hath Israel, an enemy pursueth him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_4" data-id="HS8_4">They have made kings, and not by Me, They have made princes,  and I have not known, Their silver and their gold they have  made to them idols, So that they are cut off.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_5" data-id="HS8_5">Cast off hath thy calf, O Samaria, Burned hath Mine anger  against them, Till when are they not capable of purity?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_6" data-id="HS8_6">For even it [is] of Israel; an artificer made it, And it  [is] not God, For the calf of Samaria is fragments!</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_7" data-id="HS8_7">For wind they sow, and a hurricane they reap, Stalk it hath  none -- a shoot not yielding grain, If so be it yield --  strangers do swallow it up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_8" data-id="HS8_8">Israel hath been swallowed up, Now they have been among  nations, As a vessel in which is no delight.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_9" data-id="HS8_9">For they -- they have gone up [to] Asshur, A wild ass alone  by himself [is] Ephraim, They have hired lovers!</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_10" data-id="HS8_10">Also though they hire among nations, Now I gather them, and  they are pained a little, From the burden of a king of princes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_11" data-id="HS8_11">Because Ephraim did multiply altars to sin, They have been  to him altars to sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_12" data-id="HS8_12">I write for him numerous things of My law, As a strange  thing they have been reckoned.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_13" data-id="HS8_13">The sacrifices of Mine offerings! They sacrifice flesh, and  they eat, Jehovah hath not accepted them, Now doth He remember  their iniquity, And inspect their sin, They -- [to] Egypt they  turn back.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_14" data-id="HS8_14">And forget doth Israel his Maker, and buildeth temples, And  Judah hath multiplied cities of defence, And I have sent a fire  into his cities, And it hath consumed their palaces!</span>
