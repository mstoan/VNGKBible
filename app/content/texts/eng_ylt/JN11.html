<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_2" data-id="JN11_2">and it was Mary who did anoint the Lord with ointment, and  did wipe his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was  ailing --</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_3" data-id="JN11_3">therefore sent the sisters unto him, saying, `Sir, lo, he  whom thou dost love is ailing;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_4" data-id="JN11_4">and Jesus having heard, said, `This ailment is not unto  death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be  glorified through it.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_5" data-id="JN11_5">And Jesus was loving Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_6" data-id="JN11_6">when, therefore, he heard that he is ailing, then indeed he  remained in the place in which he was two days,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_7" data-id="JN11_7">then after this, he saith to the disciples, `We may go to  Judea again;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_8" data-id="JN11_8">the disciples say to him, `Rabbi, now were the Jews seeking  to stone thee, and again thou dost go thither!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_9" data-id="JN11_9">Jesus answered, `Are there not twelve hours in the day? if  any one may walk in the day, he doth not stumble, because the  light of this world he doth see;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_10" data-id="JN11_10">and if any one may walk in the night, he stumbleth,  because the light is not in him.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_11" data-id="JN11_11">These things he said, and after this he saith to them,  `Lazarus our friend hath fallen asleep, but I go on that I may  awake him;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_12" data-id="JN11_12">therefore said his disciples, `Sir, if he hath fallen  asleep, he will be saved;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_13" data-id="JN11_13">but Jesus had spoken about his death, but they thought  that about the repose of sleep he speaketh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_14" data-id="JN11_14">Then, therefore, Jesus said to them freely, `Lazarus hath  died;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_15" data-id="JN11_15">and I rejoice, for your sake, (that ye may believe,) that  I was not there; but we may go to him;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_16" data-id="JN11_16">therefore said Thomas, who is called Didymus, to the  fellow-disciples, `We may go -- we also, that we may die with  him,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_17" data-id="JN11_17">Jesus, therefore, having come, found him having been four  days already in the tomb.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_18" data-id="JN11_18">And Bethany was nigh to Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs  off,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_19" data-id="JN11_19">and many of the Jews had come unto Martha and Mary, that  they might comfort them concerning their brother;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_20" data-id="JN11_20">Martha, therefore, when she heard that Jesus doth come,  met him, and Mary kept sitting in the house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_21" data-id="JN11_21">Martha, therefore, said unto Jesus, `Sir, if thou hadst  been here, my brother had not died;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_22" data-id="JN11_22">but even now, I have known that whatever thou mayest ask  of God, God will give to thee;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_23" data-id="JN11_23">Jesus saith to her, `Thy brother shall rise again.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_24" data-id="JN11_24">Martha saith to him, `I have known that he will rise  again, in the rising again in the last day;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_25" data-id="JN11_25">Jesus said to her, `I am the rising again, and the life;  he who is believing in me, even if he may die, shall live;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_26" data-id="JN11_26">and every one who is living and believing in me shall not  die -- to the age;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_27" data-id="JN11_27">believest thou this?' she saith to him, `Yes, sir, I have  believed that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who is  coming to the world.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_28" data-id="JN11_28">And these things having said, she went away, and called  Mary her sister privately, saying, `The Teacher is present,  and doth call thee;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_29" data-id="JN11_29">she, when she heard, riseth up quickly, and doth come to  him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_30" data-id="JN11_30">and Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was in the  place where Martha met him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_31" data-id="JN11_31">the Jews, therefore, who were with her in the house, and  were comforting her, having seen Mary that she rose up quickly  and went forth, followed her, saying -- `She doth go away to  the tomb, that she may weep there.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_32" data-id="JN11_32">Mary, therefore, when she came where Jesus was, having  seen him, fell at his feet, saying to him, `Sir, if thou hadst  been here, my brother had not died;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_33" data-id="JN11_33">Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews  who came with her weeping, did groan in the spirit, and  troubled himself, and he said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_34" data-id="JN11_34">`Where have ye laid him?' they say to him, `Sir, come and  see;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_35" data-id="JN11_35">Jesus wept.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_36" data-id="JN11_36">The Jews, therefore, said, `Lo, how he was loving him!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_37" data-id="JN11_37">and certain of them said, `Was not this one, who did open  the eyes of the blind man, able to cause that also this one  might not have died?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_38" data-id="JN11_38">Jesus, therefore, again groaning in himself, cometh to the  tomb, and it was a cave, and a stone was lying upon it,</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_39" data-id="JN11_39">Jesus saith, `Take ye away the stone;' the sister of him  who hath died -- Martha -- saith to him, `Sir, already he  stinketh, for he is four days dead;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_40" data-id="JN11_40">Jesus saith to her, `Said I not to thee, that if thou  mayest believe, thou shalt see the glory of God?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_41" data-id="JN11_41">They took away, therefore, the stone where the dead was  laid, and Jesus lifted his eyes upwards, and said, `Father, I  thank Thee, that Thou didst hear me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_42" data-id="JN11_42">and I knew that Thou always dost hear me, but, because of  the multitude that is standing by, I said [it], that they may  believe that Thou didst send me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_43" data-id="JN11_43">And these things saying, with a loud voice he cried out,  `Lazarus, come forth;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_44" data-id="JN11_44">and he who died came forth, being bound feet and hands  with grave-clothes, and his visage with a napkin was bound  about; Jesus saith to them, `Loose him, and suffer to go.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_45" data-id="JN11_45">Many, therefore, of the Jews who came unto Mary, and  beheld what Jesus did, believed in him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_46" data-id="JN11_46">but certain of them went away unto the Pharisees, and told  them what Jesus did;</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_47" data-id="JN11_47">the chief priests, therefore, and the Pharisees, gathered  together a sanhedrim, and said, `What may we do? because this  man doth many signs?</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_48" data-id="JN11_48">if we may let him alone thus, all will believe in him; and  the Romans will come, and will take away both our place and  nation.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_49" data-id="JN11_49">and a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being chief priest of  that year, said to them, `Ye have not known anything,</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_50" data-id="JN11_50">nor reason that it is good for us that one man may die for  the people, and not the whole nation perish.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_51" data-id="JN11_51">And this he said not of himself, but being chief priest of  that year, he did prophesy that Jesus was about to die for the  nation,</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_52" data-id="JN11_52">and not for the nation only, but that also the children of  God, who have been scattered abroad, he may gather together  into one.</span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_53" data-id="JN11_53">From that day, therefore, they took counsel together that  they may kill him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_54" data-id="JN11_54">Jesus, therefore, was no more freely walking among the  Jews, but went away thence to the region nigh the wilderness,  to a city called Ephraim, and there he tarried with his  disciples.</span>
<span class="v-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_55" data-id="JN11_55">And the passover of the Jews was nigh, and many went up to  Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, that they  might purify themselves;</span>
<span class="v-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_56" data-id="JN11_56">they were seeking, therefore, Jesus, and said one with  another, standing in the temple, `What doth appear to you --  that he may not come to the feast?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN11_57" data-id="JN11_57">and both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a  command, that if any one may know where he is, he may shew  [it], so that they may seize him.</span>
