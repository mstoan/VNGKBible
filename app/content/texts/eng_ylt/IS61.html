<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_2" data-id="IS61_2">To proclaim the year of the good pleasure of Jehovah, And  the day of vengeance of our God, To comfort all mourners.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_3" data-id="IS61_3">To appoint to mourners in Zion, To give to them beauty  instead of ashes, The oil of joy instead of mourning, A  covering of praise for a spirit of weakness, And He is calling  to them, `Trees of righteousness, The planting of Jehovah -- to  be beautified.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_4" data-id="IS61_4">And they have built the wastes of old, The desolations of  the ancients they raise up, And they have renewed waste cities,  The desolations of generation and generation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_5" data-id="IS61_5">And strangers have stood and fed your flock, Sons of a  foreigner [are] your husbandmen, And your vine-dressers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_6" data-id="IS61_6">And ye are called `Priests of Jehovah,' `Ministers of our  God,' is said of you, The strength of nations ye consume, And  in their honour ye do boast yourselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_7" data-id="IS61_7">Instead of your shame and confusion, A second time they  sing of their portion, Therefore in their land A second time do  they take possession, Joy age-during [is] for them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_8" data-id="IS61_8">For I [am] Jehovah, loving judgment, Hating plunder for a  burnt-offering, And I have given their wage in truth, And a  covenant age-during I make for them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_9" data-id="IS61_9">And known among nations hath been their seed, And their  offspring in the midst of the peoples, All their beholders  acknowledge them, For they [are] a seed Jehovah hath blessed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_10" data-id="IS61_10">I greatly rejoice in Jehovah, Joy doth my soul in my God,  For He clothed me with garments of salvation, With a robe of  righteousness covereth Me, As a bridegroom prepareth ornaments,  And as a bride putteth on her jewels.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_11" data-id="IS61_11">For, as the earth bringeth forth her shoots, And as a  garden causeth its sown things to shoot up, So the Lord Jehovah  causeth righteousness and praise To shoot up before all the  nations!</span>
