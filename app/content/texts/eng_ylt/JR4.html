<div class="c">4</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_1" data-id="JR4_1">If thou dost turn back, O Israel, An affirmation of Jehovah,  unto Me turn back, And if thou dost turn aside Thine  abominations from My face, Then thou dost not bemoan.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_2" data-id="JR4_2">And thou hast sworn -- Jehovah liveth, In truth, in  judgment, and in righteousness, And blessed themselves in Him  have nations, And in Him they boast themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_3" data-id="JR4_3">For thus said Jehovah, To the man of Judah, and to  Jerusalem: Till for yourselves tillage, And do not sow unto the  thorns.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_4" data-id="JR4_4">Be circumcised to Jehovah, And turn aside the foreskins of  your heart, O man of Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem,  Lest My fury go out as fire, and hath burned, And there is none  quenching, Because of the evil of your doings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_5" data-id="JR4_5">Declare in Judah, and in Jerusalem sound, And say ye, `Blow  a trumpet in the land,' Call ye fully, and say ye: `Be  gathered, and we go in to the fenced city.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_6" data-id="JR4_6">Lift up an ensign Zionward, Strengthen yourselves, stand not  still, For evil I am bringing in from the north, And a great  destruction.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_7" data-id="JR4_7">Gone up hath a lion from his thicket, And a destroyer of  nations hath journeyed, He hath come forth from his place To  make thy land become a desolation, Thy cities are laid waste,  without inhabitant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_8" data-id="JR4_8">For this, gird on sackcloth, lament and howl, For the fierce  anger of Jehovah hath not turned back from us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_9" data-id="JR4_9">And it hath come to pass, in that day, An affirmation of  Jehovah: `Perish doth the heart of the king, And the heart of  the princes, And astonished have been the priests, And the  prophets do wonder.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_10" data-id="JR4_10">And I say, `Ah, Lord Jehovah, Surely thou hast entirely  forgotten this people and Jerusalem, saying, Peace is for you,  And struck hath a sword unto the soul!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_11" data-id="JR4_11">At that time it is said of this people, And of Jerusalem:  `A dry wind of high places in the wilderness,' The way of the  daughter of My people, (Not for winnowing, nor for cleansing,)</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_12" data-id="JR4_12">A full wind from these doth come for Me, Now, also, I speak  judgments with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_13" data-id="JR4_13">Lo, as clouds he cometh up, And as a hurricane his  chariots, Lighter than eagles have been his horses, Wo to us,  for we have been spoiled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_14" data-id="JR4_14">Wash from evil thy heart, O Jerusalem, That thou mayest be  saved, Till when dost thou lodge in thy heart Thoughts of thy  strength?</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_15" data-id="JR4_15">For a voice is declaring from Dan, And sounding sorrow from  mount Ephraim.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_16" data-id="JR4_16">Make ye mention to the nations, Lo, sound ye to Jerusalem:  `Besiegers are coming from the land afar off, And they give  forth against cities of Judah their voice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_17" data-id="JR4_17">As the keepers of a field They have been against her round  about, For with Me she hath been rebellious, An affirmation of  Jehovah.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_18" data-id="JR4_18">Thy way and thy doings have done these to thee, This [is]  thy vexation, for [it is] bitter, For it hath struck unto thy  heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_19" data-id="JR4_19">My bowels, my bowels! I am pained [at] the walls of my  heart, Make a noise for me doth My heart, I am not silent, For  the voice of a trumpet I have heard, O my soul -- a shout of  battle!</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_20" data-id="JR4_20">Destruction on destruction is proclaimed, For spoiled hath  been all the land, Suddenly spoiled have been my tents, In a  moment -- my curtains.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_21" data-id="JR4_21">Till when do I see an ensign? Do I hear the voice of a  trumpet?</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_22" data-id="JR4_22">For my people [are] foolish, me they have not known,  Foolish sons [are] they, yea, they [are] not intelligent, Wise  [are] they to do evil, And to do good they have not known.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_23" data-id="JR4_23">I looked [to] the land, and lo, waste and void, And unto  the heavens, and their light is not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_24" data-id="JR4_24">I have looked [to] the mountains, And lo, they are  trembling. And all the hills moved themselves lightly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_25" data-id="JR4_25">I have looked, and lo, man is not, And all fowls of the  heavens have fled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_26" data-id="JR4_26">I have looked, and lo, The fruitful place [is] a  wilderness, And all its cities have been broken down, Because  of Jehovah, Because of the fierceness of His anger.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_27" data-id="JR4_27">For thus said Jehovah: All the land is a desolation, but a  completion I make not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_28" data-id="JR4_28">For this doth the land mourn, And black have been the  heavens above, because I have spoken -- I have purposed, And I  have not repented, Nor do I turn back from it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_29" data-id="JR4_29">From the voice of the horseman, And of him shooting with  the bow, all the city is fleeing, They have come into thickets,  And on cliffs they have gone up, All the city is forsaken, And  there is no one dwelling in them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_30" data-id="JR4_30">And thou, O spoiled one, what dost thou? For thou puttest  on scarlet, For thou adornest thyself [with] ornaments of gold.  For thou rendest with pain thine eyes, In vain thou dost make  thyself fair, Kicked against thee have doting ones, Thy life  they do seek.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_31" data-id="JR4_31">For a voice as of a sick woman I have heard, Distress, as  of one bringing forth a first-born, The voice of the daughter  of Zion, She bewaileth herself, she spreadeth out her hands,  `Wo to me now, for weary is my soul of slayers!'</span>
