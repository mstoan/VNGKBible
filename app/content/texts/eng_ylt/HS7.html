<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_2" data-id="HS7_2">And they do not say to their heart, [That] all their evil I  have remembered, Now compassed them have their doings,  Over-against My face they have been.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_3" data-id="HS7_3">With their wickedness they make glad a king, And with their  lies -- princes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_4" data-id="HS7_4">All of them [are] adulterers, Like a burning oven of a  baker, He ceaseth from stirring up after kneading the dough,  till its leavening.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_5" data-id="HS7_5">A day of our king! Princes have polluted themselves [with]  the poison of wine, He hath drawn out his hand with scorners.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_6" data-id="HS7_6">For they have drawn near, As an oven [is] their heart, In  their lying in wait all the night sleep doth their baker,  Morning! he is burning as a flaming fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_7" data-id="HS7_7">All of them are warm as an oven, And they have devoured  their judges, All their kings have fallen, There is none  calling unto Me among them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_8" data-id="HS7_8">Ephraim! among peoples he mixeth himself, Ephraim hath been  a cake unturned.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_9" data-id="HS7_9">Devoured have strangers his power, And he hath not known,  Also old age hath sprinkled [itself] on him, And he hath not  known.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_10" data-id="HS7_10">And humbled hath been the excellency of Israel to his face,  And they have not turned back unto Jehovah their God, Nor have  they sought Him for all this.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_11" data-id="HS7_11">And Ephraim is as a simple dove without heart, Egypt they  called on -- [to] Asshur they have gone.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_12" data-id="HS7_12">When they go I spread over them My net, As the fowl of the  heavens I bring them down, I chastise them as their company  hath heard.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_14" data-id="HS7_14">And have not cried unto Me with their heart, but howl on  their beds, For corn and new wine they assemble themselves,  They turn aside against Me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_15" data-id="HS7_15">And I instructed -- I strengthened their arms, And  concerning Me they think evil!</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_16" data-id="HS7_16">They turn back -- not to the Most High, They have been as a  deceitful bow, Fall by sword do their princes, From the  insolence of their tongue, This [is] their derision in the land  of Egypt!</span>
