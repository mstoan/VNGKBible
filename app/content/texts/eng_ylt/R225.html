<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v R225_24" data-id="R225_24">and [taketh] all the gold, and the silver, and all the  vessels that are found in the house of God with Obed-Edom, and  the treasures of the house of the king, and the sons of the  pledges, and turneth back to Samaria.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v R225_25" data-id="R225_25">And Amaziah son of Joash, king of Judah, liveth after the  death of Joash son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel, fifteen years;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v R225_26" data-id="R225_26">and the rest of the matters of Amaziah, the first and the  last, lo, are they not written on the books of the kings of  Judah and Israel?</span>
