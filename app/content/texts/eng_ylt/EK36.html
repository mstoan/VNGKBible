<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_2" data-id="EK36_2">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because the enemy said against  you, Aha, and the high places of old for a possession have been  to us,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_3" data-id="EK36_3">therefore, prophesy, and thou hast said: Thus said the Lord  Jehovah: Because, even because, of desolating, And of  swallowing you up from round about, For your being a possession  to the remnant of the nations, And ye are taken up on the tip  of the tongue, And [are] an evil report of the people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_4" data-id="EK36_4">Therefore, O mountains of Israel, Hear a word of the Lord  Jehovah: Thus said the Lord Jehovah, to mountains, and to  hills, To streams, and to valleys, And to wastes that [are]  desolate, And to cities that are forsaken, That have been for a  prey, And for a scorn, to the remnant of the nations who [are]  round about.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_5" data-id="EK36_5">Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Have I not, in the  fire of My jealousy, Spoken against the remnant of the nations,  And against Edom -- all of it, Who gave My land to themselves  for a possession, With the joy of the whole heart -- with  despite of soul, For the sake of casting it out for a prey?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_6" data-id="EK36_6">Therefore, prophesy concerning the ground of Israel, And  thou hast said to mountains, and to hills, To streams, and to  valleys, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I, in My jealousy, and  in My fury, I have spoken, Because the shame of nations ye have  borne.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_7" data-id="EK36_7">Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: I -- I have lifted  up My hand, Do not -- the nations who [are] with you from round  about -- they their own shame bear?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_8" data-id="EK36_8">And ye, O mountains of Israel, Your branch ye give out, and  your fruits ye bear for My people Israel, For they have drawn  near to come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_9" data-id="EK36_9">For, lo, I [am] for you, and have turned to you, And ye  have been tilled and sown.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_11" data-id="EK36_11">And I have multiplied on you man and beast, And they have  multiplied and been fruitful, And I have caused you to dwell  according to your former states, And I have done better than at  your beginnings, And ye have known that I [am] Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_12" data-id="EK36_12">And I have caused man to walk over you, -- My people  Israel, And they possess thee, and thou hast been to them for  an inheritance, And thou dost add no more to bereave them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_13" data-id="EK36_13">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because they are saying to  you: A devourer of men [art] thou, And a bereaver of thy  nations thou hast been,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_14" data-id="EK36_14">Therefore, man thou devourest no more, And thy nations  thou causest not to stumble any more, An affirmation of the  Lord Jehovah.</span>

<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_21" data-id="EK36_21">And I have pity on My holy name, That the house of Israel  have polluted among nations whither they have gone in.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_22" data-id="EK36_22">Therefore, say to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord  Jehovah: Not for your sake am I working, O house of Israel, But  -- for My holy name, That ye have polluted among nations  whither ye have gone in.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_23" data-id="EK36_23">And I have sanctified My great name, That is profaned  among nations, That ye have polluted in your midst, And known  have the nations that I [am] Jehovah, An affirmation of the  Lord Jehovah, In My being sanctified in you before your eyes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_24" data-id="EK36_24">And I have taken you out of the nations, And have gathered  you out of all the lands, And I have brought you in unto your  land,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_25" data-id="EK36_25">And I have sprinkled over you clean water, And ye have  been clean; From all your uncleannesses, and from all your  idols, I do cleanse you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_26" data-id="EK36_26">And I have given to you a new heart, And a new spirit I  give in your midst, And I have turned aside the heart of stone  out of your flesh, And I have given to you a heart of flesh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_27" data-id="EK36_27">And My Spirit I give in your midst, And I have done this,  so that in My statutes ye walk, And My judgments ye keep, and  have done them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_28" data-id="EK36_28">And ye have dwelt in the land that I have given to your  fathers, And ye have been to Me for a people, And I -- I am to  you for God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_29" data-id="EK36_29">And I have saved you from all your uncleannesses, And I  have called unto the corn, and multiplied it, And I have put no  famine upon you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_30" data-id="EK36_30">And I have multiplied the fruit of the tree, And the  increase of the field, So that ye receive not any more a  reproach of famine among nations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_31" data-id="EK36_31">And ye have remembered your ways that [are] evil, And your  doings that [are] not good, And have been loathsome in your own  faces, For your iniquities, and for your abominations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_32" data-id="EK36_32">Not for your sake am I working, An affirmation of the Lord  Jehovah, Be it known to you, Be ashamed and confounded, because  of your ways, O house of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_33" data-id="EK36_33">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In the day of My cleansing you  from all your iniquities, I have caused the cities to be  inhabited, And the wastes have been built,</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_34" data-id="EK36_34">And the desolate land is tilled, Instead of which it was a  desolation before the eyes of every passer by,</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_35" data-id="EK36_35">And they have said: This land, that was desolated, Hath  been as the garden of Eden, And the cities -- the wasted, And  the desolated, and the broken down, Fenced places have  remained.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_36" data-id="EK36_36">And known have the nations who are left round about you,  That I Jehovah have built the thrown down, I have planted the  desolated: I Jehovah have spoken, and I have done [it].</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_37" data-id="EK36_37">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Yet this I am required, By the  house of Israel to do to them, I multiply them as a flock of  men,</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK36_38" data-id="EK36_38">As a flock of holy ones, as a flock of Jerusalem, In her  appointed seasons, So are the waste cities full of flocks of  men, And they have known that I [am] Jehovah!'</span>
