<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_2" data-id="R216_2">And Asa bringeth out silver and gold from the treasures of  the house of Jehovah, and of the house of the king, and sendeth  unto Ben-Hadad king of Aram, who is dwelling in Damascus,  saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_3" data-id="R216_3">`A covenant [is] between me and thee, and between my father  and thy father, lo, I have sent to thee silver and gold; go,  break thy covenant with Baasha king of Israel, and he doth go  up from off me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_4" data-id="R216_4">And Ben-Hadad hearkeneth unto king Asa, and sendeth the  heads of the forces that he hath unto cities of Israel, and  they smite Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-Maim, and all the stores,  cities of Naphtali.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_5" data-id="R216_5">And it cometh to pass, at Baasha's hearing, that he ceaseth  from building Ramah, and letteth his work rest;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_6" data-id="R216_6">and Asa the king hath taken all Judah, and they bear away  the stones of Ramah, and its wood, that Baasha hath built, and  he buildeth with them Geba and Mizpah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_7" data-id="R216_7">And at that time hath Hanani the seer come in unto Asa king  of Judah, and saith unto him, `Because of thy leaning on the  king of Aram, and thou hast not leaned on Jehovah thy God,  therefore hath the force of the king of Aram escaped from thy  hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_8" data-id="R216_8">Did not the Cushim and the Lubim become a very great force  for multitude, for chariot, and for horsemen? and in thy  leaning on Jehovah He gave them into thy hand,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_9" data-id="R216_9">for Jehovah -- His eyes go to and fro in all the earth, to  show Himself strong [for] a people whose heart [is] perfect  towards Him; thou hast been foolish concerning this, because --  henceforth there are with thee wars.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_10" data-id="R216_10">And Asa is angry at the seer, and giveth him to the house  of torture, for [he is] in a rage with him for this; and Asa  oppresseth [some] of the people at that time.</span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_13" data-id="R216_13">And Asa lieth with his fathers, and dieth in the forty and  first year of his reign,</span>
