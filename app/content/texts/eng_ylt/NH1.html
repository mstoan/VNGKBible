<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH1_2" data-id="NH1_2">and come in doth Hanani, one of my brethren, he and men of  Judah, and I ask them concerning the Jews, the escaped part  that have been left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH1_3" data-id="NH1_3">and they say to me, `Those left, who have been left of the  captivity there in the province, [are] in great evil, and in  reproach, and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its  gates have been burnt with fire.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH1_4" data-id="NH1_4">And it cometh to pass, at my hearing these words, I have sat  down, and I weep and mourn [for] days, and I am fasting and  praying before the God of the heavens.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH1_5" data-id="NH1_5">And I say, `I beseech thee, O Jehovah, God of the heavens,  God, the great and the fearful, keeping the covenant and  kindness for those loving Him, and for those keeping His  commands,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH1_6" data-id="NH1_6">let Thine ear be, I pray Thee, attentive, and Thine eyes  open, to hearken unto the prayer of Thy servant, that I am  praying before Thee to-day, by day and by night, concerning the  sons of Israel Thy servants, and confessing concerning the sins  of the sons of Israel, that we have sinned against Thee; yea, I  and the house of my father have sinned;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH1_7" data-id="NH1_7">we have acted very corruptly against Thee, and have not kept  the commands, and the statutes, and the judgments, that Thou  didst command Moses Thy servant.</span>
