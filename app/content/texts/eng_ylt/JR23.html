<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR23_2" data-id="JR23_2">Therefore, thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, Against the  shepherds who feed My people, Ye have scattered My flock, and  drive them away, And have not inspected them, Lo, I am charging  on you the evil of your doings, An affirmation of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR23_3" data-id="JR23_3">And I do gather the remnant of My flock Out of all the  lands whither I drove them, And have brought them back unto  their fold, And they have been fruitful, and multiplied.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR23_4" data-id="JR23_4">And I have raised for them shepherds, And they have fed  them, And they fear no more, nor are affrighted, Nor are they  lacking -- an affirmation of Jehovah.</span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR23_8" data-id="JR23_8">But -- Jehovah liveth, who brought up, And who brought in,  the seed of the house of Israel, From the land of the north,  And from all the lands whither I drove them, And they have  dwelt on their own ground!</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR23_9" data-id="JR23_9">In reference to the prophets: Broken hath been my heart in  my midst, Fluttered have all my bones, I have been as a man --  a drunkard, And as a man -- wine hath passed over him, Because  of Jehovah, and of His holy words.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR23_10" data-id="JR23_10">For of adulterers hath the land been full, For because of  these hath the land mourned, Dried up hath been the pleasant  places of the wilderness, And their course is evil, and their  might -- not right.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR23_15" data-id="JR23_15">Therefore, thus said Jehovah of Hosts, concerning the  prophets: Lo, I am causing them to eat wormwood, And have  caused them to drink water of gall, For, from prophets of  Jerusalem Hath profanity gone forth to all the land.</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR23_17" data-id="JR23_17">Saying diligently to those despising The word of Jehovah:  Peace is for you, And [to] every one walking in the  stubbornness of his heart they have said: Evil doth not come in  unto you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR23_18" data-id="JR23_18">For who hath stood in the counsel of Jehovah, And seeth  and heareth His word? Who hath regarded My word, and  hearkeneth?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR23_19" data-id="JR23_19">Lo, a whirlwind of Jehovah -- Fury hath gone out, even a  piercing whirlwind, On the head of the wicked it stayeth.</span>

<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR23_21" data-id="JR23_21">I have not sent the prophets, and they have run, I have  not spoken unto them, and they have prophesied.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR23_22" data-id="JR23_22">But -- if they stood in My counsel, Then they cause My  people to hear My words, And they turn them back from their  evil way, And from the evil of their doings.</span>

<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR23_26" data-id="JR23_26">Till when is it in the heart of the prophets? The prophets  of falsehood, Yea, prophets of the deceit of their heart,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR23_27" data-id="JR23_27">Who are devising to cause My people To forget My name by  their dreams, That they recount each to his neighbour, As their  fathers forgot my name for Baal.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR23_28" data-id="JR23_28">The prophet with whom [is] a dream, Let him recount the  dream, And he with whom [is] My word, Let him truly speak My  word. What -- to the straw with the corn? An affirmation of  Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR23_29" data-id="JR23_29">Is it not thus? My word [is] as a fire, An affirmation of  Jehovah. And as a hammer -- it breaketh in pieces a rock.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR23_30" data-id="JR23_30">Therefore, lo, I [am] against the prophets, An affirmation  of Jehovah, Stealing My words each from his neighbour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR23_31" data-id="JR23_31">Lo, I [am] against the prophets, An affirmation of  Jehovah, Who are making smooth their tongue, And they affirm --  an affirmation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR23_32" data-id="JR23_32">Lo, I [am] against the prophets of false dreams, An  affirmation of Jehovah, And they recount them, and cause my  people to err, By their falsehoods, and by their instability,  And I -- I have not sent them, Nor have I commanded them, And  they are not at all profitable to this people, An affirmation  of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR23_33" data-id="JR23_33">And when this people, or the prophet, Or a priest, doth  ask thee, saying, What [is] the burden of Jehovah? Then thou  hast said unto them: Ye [are] the burden, and I have left you,  An affirmation of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR23_34" data-id="JR23_34">And the prophet, and the priest, and the people, That  saith, The burden of Jehovah, I have seen after that man, and  after his house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR23_35" data-id="JR23_35">Thus do ye say each unto his neighbour, And each unto his  brother: What hath Jehovah answered? And what hath Jehovah  spoken?</span>
