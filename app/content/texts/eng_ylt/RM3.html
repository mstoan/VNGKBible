<div class="c">3</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_1" data-id="RM3_1">What, then, [is] the superiority of the Jew? or what the  profit of the circumcision?</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_2" data-id="RM3_2">much in every way; for first, indeed, that they were  intrusted with the oracles of God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_3" data-id="RM3_3">for what, if certain were faithless? shall their  faithlessness the faithfulness of god make useless?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_4" data-id="RM3_4">let it not be! and let God become true, and every man false,  according as it hath been written, `That Thou mayest be  declared righteous in Thy words, and mayest overcome in Thy  being judged.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_5" data-id="RM3_5">And, if our unrighteousness God's righteousness doth  establish, what shall we say? is God unrighteous who is  inflicting the wrath? (after the manner of a man I speak)</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_6" data-id="RM3_6">let it not be! since how shall God judge the world?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_7" data-id="RM3_7">for if the truth of God in my falsehood did more abound to  His glory, why yet am I also as a sinner judged?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_8" data-id="RM3_8">and not, as we are evil spoken of, and as certain affirm us  to say -- `We may do the evil things, that the good ones may  come?' whose judgment is righteous.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_9" data-id="RM3_9">What, then? are we better? not at all! for we did before  charge both Jews and Greeks with being all under sin,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_10" data-id="RM3_10">according as it hath been written -- `There is none  righteous, not even one;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_11" data-id="RM3_11">There is none who is understanding, there is none who is  seeking after God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_12" data-id="RM3_12">All did go out of the way, together they became  unprofitable, there is none doing good, there is not even one.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_13" data-id="RM3_13">A sepulchre opened [is] their throat; with their tongues  they used deceit; poison of asps [is] under their lips.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_14" data-id="RM3_14">Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_15" data-id="RM3_15">Swift [are] their feet to shed blood.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_16" data-id="RM3_16">Ruin and misery [are] in their ways.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_17" data-id="RM3_17">And a way of peace they did not know.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_18" data-id="RM3_18">There is no fear of God before their eyes.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_19" data-id="RM3_19">And we have known that as many things as the law saith, to  those in the law it doth speak, that every mouth may be  stopped, and all the world may come under judgment to God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_20" data-id="RM3_20">wherefore by works of law shall no flesh be declared  righteous before Him, for through law is a knowledge of sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_21" data-id="RM3_21">And now apart from law hath the righteousness of God been  manifested, testified to by the law and the prophets,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_22" data-id="RM3_22">and the righteousness of God [is] through the faith of  Jesus Christ to all, and upon all those believing, -- for  there is no difference,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_23" data-id="RM3_23">for all did sin, and are come short of the glory of God --</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_24" data-id="RM3_24">being declared righteous freely by His grace through the  redemption that [is] in Christ Jesus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_25" data-id="RM3_25">whom God did set forth a mercy seat, through the faith in  his blood, for the shewing forth of His righteousness, because  of the passing over of the bygone sins in the forbearance of  God --</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_26" data-id="RM3_26">for the shewing forth of His righteousness in the present  time, for His being righteous, and declaring him righteous who  [is] of the faith of Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_27" data-id="RM3_27">Where then [is] the boasting? it was excluded; by what law?  of works? no, but by a law of faith:</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_28" data-id="RM3_28">therefore do we reckon a man to be declared righteous by  faith, apart from works of law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_29" data-id="RM3_29">The God of Jews only [is He], and not also of nations?</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_30" data-id="RM3_30">yes, also of nations; since one [is] God who shall declare  righteous the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision  through the faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_31" data-id="RM3_31">Law then do we make useless through the faith? let it not  be! yea, we do establish law.</span>
