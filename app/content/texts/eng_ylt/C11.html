<div class="mt">1 Corinthians</div><div class="c">1</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_1" data-id="C11_1">Paul, a called apostle of Jesus Christ, through the will of  God, and Sosthenes the brother,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_2" data-id="C11_2">to the assembly of God that is in Corinth, to those  sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all those  calling upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place  -- both theirs and ours:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_3" data-id="C11_3">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord  Jesus Christ!</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_4" data-id="C11_4">I give thanks to my God always concerning you for the grace  of God that was given to you in Christ Jesus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_5" data-id="C11_5">that in every thing ye were enriched in him, in all  discourse and all knowledge,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_6" data-id="C11_6">according as the testimony of the Christ was confirmed in  you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_7" data-id="C11_7">so that ye are not behind in any gift, waiting for the  revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_8" data-id="C11_8">who also shall confirm you unto the end -- unblamable in the  day of our Lord Jesus Christ;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_9" data-id="C11_9">faithful [is] God, through whom ye were called to the  fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_10" data-id="C11_10">And I call upon you, brethren, through the name of our Lord  Jesus Christ, that the same thing ye may all say, and there may  not be divisions among you, and ye may be perfected in the same  mind, and in the same judgment,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_11" data-id="C11_11">for it was signified to me concerning you, my brethren, by  those of Chloe, that contentions are among you;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_12" data-id="C11_12">and I say this, that each one of you saith, `I, indeed, am  of Paul' -- `and I of Apollos,' -- `and I of Cephas,' -- `and I  of Christ.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_13" data-id="C11_13">Hath the Christ been divided? was Paul crucified for you?  or to the name of Paul were ye baptized;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_14" data-id="C11_14">I give thanks to God that no one of you did I baptize,  except Crispus and Gaius --</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_15" data-id="C11_15">that no one may say that to my own name I did baptize;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_16" data-id="C11_16">and I did baptize also Stephanas' household -- further, I  have not known if I did baptize any other.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_17" data-id="C11_17">For Christ did not send me to baptize, but -- to proclaim  good news; not in wisdom of discourse, that the cross of the  Christ may not be made of none effect;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_18" data-id="C11_18">for the word of the cross to those indeed perishing is  foolishness, and to us -- those being saved -- it is the power  of God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_19" data-id="C11_19">for it hath been written, `I will destroy the wisdom of the  wise, and the intelligence of the intelligent I will bring to  nought;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_20" data-id="C11_20">where [is] the wise? where the scribe? where a disputer of  this age? did not God make foolish the wisdom of this world?</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_21" data-id="C11_21">for, seeing in the wisdom of God the world through the  wisdom knew not God, it did please God through the foolishness  of the preaching to save those believing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_22" data-id="C11_22">Since also Jews ask a sign, and Greeks seek wisdom,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_23" data-id="C11_23">also we -- we preach Christ crucified, to Jews, indeed, a  stumbling-block, and to Greeks foolishness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_24" data-id="C11_24">and to those called -- both Jews and Greeks -- Christ the  power of God, and the wisdom of God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_25" data-id="C11_25">because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the  weakness of God is stronger than men;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_26" data-id="C11_26">for see your calling, brethren, that not many [are] wise  according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_27" data-id="C11_27">but the foolish things of the world did God choose, that  the wise He may put to shame; and the weak things of the world  did God choose that He may put to shame the strong;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_28" data-id="C11_28">and the base things of the world, and the things despised  did God choose, and the things that are not, that the things  that are He may make useless --</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_29" data-id="C11_29">that no flesh may glory before Him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_30" data-id="C11_30">and of Him ye -- ye are in Christ Jesus, who became to us  from God wisdom, righteousness also, and sanctification, and  redemption,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_31" data-id="C11_31">that, according as it hath been written, `He who is  glorying -- in the Lord let him glory.'</span>
