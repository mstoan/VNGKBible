<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK9_2" data-id="EK9_2">And lo, six men are coming from the way of the upper gate,  that is facing the north, and each his slaughter-weapon in his  hand, and one man in their midst is clothed with linen, and a  scribe's inkhorn at his loins, and they come in, and stand near  the brazen altar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK9_3" data-id="EK9_3">And the honour of the God of Israel hath gone up from off  the cherub, on which it hath been, unto the threshold of the  house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK9_4" data-id="EK9_4">And He calleth unto the man who is clothed with linen, who  hath the scribe's inkhorn at his loins, and Jehovah saith unto  him, `Pass on into the midst of the city, into the midst of  Jerusalem, and thou hast made a mark on the foreheads of the  men who are sighing and who are groaning for all the  abominations that are done in its midst.'</span>
