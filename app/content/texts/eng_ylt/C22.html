<div class="c">2</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_1" data-id="C22_1">And I decided this to myself, not again to come in sorrow  unto you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_2" data-id="C22_2">for if I make you sorry, then who is he who is making me  glad, except he who is made sorry by me?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_3" data-id="C22_3">and I wrote to you this same thing, that having come, I may  not have sorrow from them of whom it behoved me to have joy,  having confidence in you all, that my joy is of you all,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_4" data-id="C22_4">for out of much tribulation and pressure of heart I wrote to  you through many tears, not that ye might be made sorry, but  that ye might know the love that I have more abundantly toward  you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_5" data-id="C22_5">And if any one hath caused sorrow, he hath not caused sorrow  to me, but in part, that I may not burden you all;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_6" data-id="C22_6">sufficient to such a one is this punishment, that [is] by  the more part,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_7" data-id="C22_7">so that, on the contrary, [it is] rather for you to forgive  and to comfort, lest by over abundant sorrow such a one may be  swallowed up;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_8" data-id="C22_8">wherefore, I call upon you to confirm love to him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_9" data-id="C22_9">for, for this also did I write, that I might know the proof  of you, whether in regard to all things ye are obedient.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_10" data-id="C22_10">And to whom ye forgive anything -- I also; for I also, if I  have forgiven anything, to whom I have forgiven [it], because  of you -- in the person of Christ -- [I forgive it,]</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_11" data-id="C22_11">that we may not be over-reached by the Adversary, for of  his devices we are not ignorant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_12" data-id="C22_12">And having come to Troas for the good news of the Christ,  and a door to me having been opened in the Lord,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_13" data-id="C22_13">I have not had rest to my spirit, on my not finding Titus  my brother, but having taken leave of them, I went forth to  Macedonia;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_14" data-id="C22_14">and to God [are] thanks, who at all times is leading us in  triumph in the Christ, and the fragrance of His knowledge He is  manifesting through us in every place,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_15" data-id="C22_15">because of Christ a sweet fragrance we are to God, in those  being saved, and in those being lost;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_16" data-id="C22_16">to the one, indeed, a fragrance of death to death, and to  the other, a fragrance of life to life; and for these things  who is sufficient?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_17" data-id="C22_17">for we are not as the many, adulterating the word of God, but  as of sincerity -- but as of God; in the presence of God, in  Christ we do speak.</span>
