<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_2" data-id="RV1_2">who did testify the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus  Christ, as many things also as he did see.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_3" data-id="RV1_3">Happy is he who is reading, and those hearing, the words of  the prophecy, and keeping the things written in it -- for the  time is nigh!</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_4" data-id="RV1_4">John to the seven assemblies that [are] in Asia: Grace to  you, and peace, from Him who is, and who was, and who is  coming, and from the Seven Spirits that are before His throne,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_5" data-id="RV1_5">and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the first-born  out of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth; to  him who did love us, and did bathe us from our sins in his  blood,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_6" data-id="RV1_6">and did make us kings and priests to his God and Father, to  him [is] the glory and the power to the ages of the ages! Amen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_7" data-id="RV1_7">Lo, he doth come with the clouds, and see him shall every  eye, even those who did pierce him, and wail because of him  shall all the tribes of the land. Yes! Amen!</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_8" data-id="RV1_8">`I am the Alpha and the Omega, beginning and end, saith the  Lord, who is, and who was, and who is coming -- the Almighty.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_9" data-id="RV1_9">I, John, who also [am] your brother, and fellow-partner in  the tribulation, and in the reign and endurance, of Jesus  Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, because of the  word of God, and because of the testimony of Jesus Christ;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_10" data-id="RV1_10">I was in the Spirit on the Lord's-day, and I heard behind  me a great voice, as of a trumpet, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_11" data-id="RV1_11">`I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last;'  and, `What thou dost see, write in a scroll, and send to the  seven assemblies that [are] in Asia; to Ephesus, and to Smyrna,  and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to  Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_12" data-id="RV1_12">And I did turn to see the voice that did speak with me, and  having turned, I saw seven golden lamp-stands,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_13" data-id="RV1_13">and in the midst of the seven lamp-stands, [one] like to a  son of man, clothed to the foot, and girt round at the breast  with a golden girdle,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_14" data-id="RV1_14">and his head and hairs white, as if white wool -- as snow,  and his eyes as a flame of fire;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_15" data-id="RV1_15">and his feet like to fine brass, as in a furnace having  been fired, and his voice as a sound of many waters,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_16" data-id="RV1_16">and having in his right hand seven stars, and out of his  mouth a sharp two-edged sword is proceeding, and his  countenance [is] as the sun shining in its might.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_17" data-id="RV1_17">And when I saw him, I did fall at his feet as dead, and he  placed his right hand upon me, saying to me, `Be not afraid; I  am the First and the Last,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_18" data-id="RV1_18">and he who is living, and I did become dead, and, lo, I am  living to the ages of the ages. Amen! and I have the keys of  the hades and of the death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_19" data-id="RV1_19">`Write the things that thou hast seen, and the things that  are, and the things that are about to come after these things;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_20" data-id="RV1_20">the secret of the seven stars that thou hast seen upon my  right hand, and the seven golden lamp-stands: the seven stars  are messengers of the seven assemblies, and the seven  lamp-stands that thou hast seen are seven assemblies.</span>
