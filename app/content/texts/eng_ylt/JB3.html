<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_2" data-id="JB3_2">And Job answereth and saith: --</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB3_3" data-id="JB3_3">Let the day perish in which I am born, And the night that  hath said: `A man-child hath been conceived.'</span>
