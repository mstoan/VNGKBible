<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH2_2" data-id="NH2_2">and the king saith to me, `Wherefore [is] thy face sad, and  thou not sick? this is nothing except sadness of heart;' and I  fear very much,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH2_3" data-id="NH2_3">and say to the king, `Let the king to the age live!  wherefore should not my face be sad, when the city, the place  of the graves of my fathers, [is] a waste, and its gates have  been consumed with fire?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH2_4" data-id="NH2_4">And the king saith to me, `For what art thou seeking?' and I  pray unto the God of the heavens,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH2_5" data-id="NH2_5">and say to the king, `If to the king [it be] good, and if  thy servant be pleasing before thee, that thou send me unto  Judah, unto the city of the graves of my fathers, and I built it.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH2_6" data-id="NH2_6">And the king saith to me (and the queen is sitting near  him), `How long is thy journey? and when dost thou return?' and  it is good before the king, and he sendeth me away, and I set  to him a time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH2_7" data-id="NH2_7">And I say to the king, `If to the king [it be] good, letters  let be given to me for the governors beyond the River, that  they let me pass over till that I come in unto Judah:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH2_8" data-id="NH2_8">and a letter unto Asaph, keeper of the paradise that the  king hath, that he give to me trees for beams [for] the gates  of the palace that the house hath, and for the wall of the city,  and for the house into which I enter;' and the king giveth to  me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH2_9" data-id="NH2_9">And I come in unto the governors beyond the River, and give  to them the letters of the king; and the king sendeth with me  heads of a force, and horsemen;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH2_10" data-id="NH2_10">and Sanballat the Horonite heareth, and Tobiah the servant,  the Ammonite, and it is evil to them -- a great evil -- that a  man hath come in to seek good for the sons of Israel.</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH2_12" data-id="NH2_12">and I rise by night, I and a few men with me, and have not  declared to a man what my God is giving unto my heart to do for  Jerusalem, and there is no beast with me except the beast on  which I am riding.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH2_13" data-id="NH2_13">And I go out through the gate of the valley by night, and  unto the front of the fountain of the dragon, and unto the gate  of the dunghill, and I am measuring about the walls of  Jerusalem, that are broken down, and its gates consumed with  fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH2_14" data-id="NH2_14">And I pass over unto the gate of the fountain, and unto the  pool of the king, and there is no place for the beast under me  to pass over,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH2_15" data-id="NH2_15">and I am going up through the brook by night, and am  measuring about the wall, and turn back, and come in through  the gate of the valley, and turn back.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH2_16" data-id="NH2_16">And the prefects have not known whither I have gone, and  what I am doing; and to the Jews, and to the priests, and to  the freemen, and to the prefects, and to the rest of those  doing the work, hitherto I have not declared [it];</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH2_17" data-id="NH2_17">and I say unto them, `Ye are seeing the evil that we are  in, in that Jerusalem [is] waste, and its gates have been burnt  with fire; come and we build the wall of Jerusalem, and we are  not any more a reproach.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH2_18" data-id="NH2_18">And I declare to them the hand of my God that is good upon  me, and also the words of the king that he said to me, and they  say, `Let us rise, and we have built;' and they strengthen  their hands for good.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH2_19" data-id="NH2_19">And Sanballat the Horonite heareth, and Tobiah the servant,  the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, and they mock at us, and  despise us, and say, `What [is] this thing that ye are doing?  against the king are ye rebelling?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH2_20" data-id="NH2_20">And I return them word, and say to them, `The God of the  heavens -- He doth give prosperity to us, and we His servants  rise and have built; and to you there is no portion, and right,  and memorial in Jerusalem.'</span>
