<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_2" data-id="MK3_2">and they were watching him, whether on the sabbaths he will  heal him, that they might accuse him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_3" data-id="MK3_3">And he saith to the man having the hand withered, `Rise up  in the midst.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_4" data-id="MK3_4">And he saith to them, `Is it lawful on the sabbaths to do  good, or to do evil? life to save, or to kill?' but they were  silent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_5" data-id="MK3_5">And having looked round upon them with anger, being grieved  for the hardness of their heart, he saith to the man, `Stretch  forth thy hand;' and he stretched forth, and his hand was  restored whole as the other;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_6" data-id="MK3_6">and the Pharisees having gone forth, immediately, with the  Herodians, were taking counsel against him how they might  destroy him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_7" data-id="MK3_7">And Jesus withdrew with his disciples unto the sea, and a  great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judea,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_8" data-id="MK3_8">and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea and beyond the Jordan;  and they about Tyre and Sidon -- a great multitude -- having  heard how great things he was doing, came unto him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_9" data-id="MK3_9">And he said to his disciples that a little boat may wait on  him, because of the multitude, that they may not press upon  him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_10" data-id="MK3_10">for he did heal many, so that they threw themselves on him,  in order to touch him -- as many as had plagues;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_11" data-id="MK3_11">and the unclean spirits, when they were seeing him, were  falling down before him, and were crying, saying -- `Thou art  the Son of God;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_12" data-id="MK3_12">and many times he was charging them that they might not  make him manifest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_13" data-id="MK3_13">And he goeth up to the mountain, and doth call near whom he  willed, and they went away to him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_14" data-id="MK3_14">and he appointed twelve, that they may be with him, and  that he may send them forth to preach,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_15" data-id="MK3_15">and to have power to heal the sicknesses, and to cast out  the demons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_16" data-id="MK3_16">And he put on Simon the name Peter;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_17" data-id="MK3_17">and James of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, and he  put on them names -- Boanerges, that is, `Sons of thunder;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_18" data-id="MK3_18">and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and  Thomas, and James of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the  Cananite,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_19" data-id="MK3_19">and Judas Iscariot, who did also deliver him up; and they  come into a house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_20" data-id="MK3_20">And come together again doth a multitude, so that they are  not able even to eat bread;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_21" data-id="MK3_21">and his friends having heard, went forth to lay hold on  him, for they said that he was beside himself,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_22" data-id="MK3_22">and the scribes who [are] from Jerusalem having come down,  said -- `He hath Beelzeboul,' and -- `By the ruler of the  demons he doth cast out the demons.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_23" data-id="MK3_23">And, having called them near, in similes he said to them,  `How is the Adversary able to cast out the Adversary?</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_24" data-id="MK3_24">and if a kingdom against itself be divided, that kingdom  cannot be made to stand;</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_25" data-id="MK3_25">and if a house against itself be divided, that house cannot  be made to stand;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_26" data-id="MK3_26">and if the Adversary did rise against himself, and hath  been divided, he cannot be made to stand, but hath an end.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_27" data-id="MK3_27">`No one is able the vessels of the strong man -- having  entered into his house -- to spoil, if first he may not bind  the strong man, and then his house he will spoil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_28" data-id="MK3_28">`Verily I say to you, that all the sins shall be forgiven  to the sons of men, and evil speakings with which they might  speak evil,</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_29" data-id="MK3_29">but whoever may speak evil in regard to the Holy Spirit  hath not forgiveness -- to the age, but is in danger of  age-during judgment;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_30" data-id="MK3_30">because they said, `He hath an unclean spirit.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_31" data-id="MK3_31">Then come do his brethren and mother, and standing without,  they sent unto him, calling him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_32" data-id="MK3_32">and a multitude was sitting about him, and they said to  him, `Lo, thy mother and thy brethren without do seek thee.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_33" data-id="MK3_33">And he answered them, saying, `Who is my mother, or my  brethren?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_34" data-id="MK3_34">And having looked round in a circle to those sitting about  him, he saith, `Lo, my mother and my brethren!</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_35" data-id="MK3_35">for whoever may do the will of God, he is my brother, and  my sister, and mother.'</span>
