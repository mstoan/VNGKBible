<div class="c">17</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK17_1" data-id="EK17_1">And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK17_2" data-id="EK17_2">`Son of man, put forth a riddle, and use a simile unto the  house of Israel,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK17_3" data-id="EK17_3">and thou hast said: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: The great  eagle, great-winged, long-pinioned, Full of feathers, that hath  diverse colours, Hath come in unto Lebanon, And it taketh the  foliage of the cedar,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK17_4" data-id="EK17_4">The top of its tender twigs it hath cropped, And it  bringeth it in to the land of Canaan. In a city of merchants it  hath placed it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK17_5" data-id="EK17_5">And it taketh of the seed of the land, And doth put it in a  field of seed, To take by many waters, In a conspicuous place  it hath set it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK17_6" data-id="EK17_6">And it springeth up, and becometh a spreading vine, humble  of stature, To turn its thin shoots toward itself, And its  roots are under it, And it becometh a vine, and maketh boughs,  And sendeth forth beauteous branches.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK17_7" data-id="EK17_7">And there is another great eagle, Great-winged, and  abounding with feathers, And lo, this vine hath bent its roots  toward him, And its thin shoots it hath sent out toward him, To  water it from the furrows of its planting,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK17_8" data-id="EK17_8">On a good field, by many waters, it is planted, To make  branches, and to bear fruit, To be for an goodly vine.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK17_9" data-id="EK17_9">Say: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: It prospereth -- its roots  doth he not draw out, And its fruit cut off, and it is  withered? [In] all the leaves of its springing it withereth,  And not by great strength, and by a numerous people, To lift it  up by its roots.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK17_10" data-id="EK17_10">And lo, the planted thing -- doth it prosper? When come  against it doth the east wind, Doth it not utterly wither? On  the furrows of its springing it withereth.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK17_11" data-id="EK17_11">And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying:</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK17_12" data-id="EK17_12">`Say, I pray thee, to the rebellious house, Have ye not  known what these [are]? Say, Lo, come hath the king of Babylon  to Jerusalem, And he taketh its king, and its princes, And  bringeth them to himself to Babylon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK17_13" data-id="EK17_13">And he taketh of the seed of the kingdom, And maketh with  him a covenant, And bringeth him in to an oath, And the mighty  of the land he hath taken,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK17_14" data-id="EK17_14">That the kingdom may be humble, That it may not lift  itself up, To keep his covenant -- that it may stand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK17_15" data-id="EK17_15">And he rebelleth against him, To send his messengers to  Egypt, To give to him horses, and much people, Doth he prosper?  doth he escape who is doing these things? And hath he broken  covenant and escaped?</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK17_16" data-id="EK17_16">I live -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah, Doth he not  -- in the place of the king who is causing him to reign, Whose  oath he hath despised, And whose covenant he hath broken, With  him -- in the midst of Babylon -- die?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK17_17" data-id="EK17_17">And not with a great force, and with a numerous assembly,  Doth Pharaoh maintain him in battle, By pouring out a mount,  and in building a fortification, To cut off many souls.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK17_18" data-id="EK17_18">And he despised the oath -- to break covenant, And lo, he  hath given his hand, And all these he hath done, he escapeth  not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK17_19" data-id="EK17_19">Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: I live -- Mine oath  that he hath despised, And My covenant that he hath broken,  Have I not put it on his head?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK17_20" data-id="EK17_20">And I have spread out for him My snare, And he hath been  caught in My net, And I have brought him in to Babylon, And  pleaded with him there his trespass, That he hath trespassed  against Me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK17_21" data-id="EK17_21">And all his fugitives, with all his bands, By sword do  fall, and those remaining, To every wind they are spread out,  And ye have known that I, Jehovah, have spoken.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK17_22" data-id="EK17_22">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: I have taken of the foliage of  the high cedar, And I have set [it], From the top of its tender  shoots a tender one I crop, And I -- I have planted [it] on a  mountain high and lofty.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK17_23" data-id="EK17_23">In a mountain -- the high place of Israel, I plant it, And  it hath borne boughs, and yielded fruit, And become a goodly  cedar, And dwelt under it have all birds of every wing, In the  shade of its thin shoots they dwell.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK17_24" data-id="EK17_24">And known have all trees of the field That I, Jehovah,  have made low the high tree, I have set on high the low tree, I  have dried up the moist tree, And I have caused the dry tree to  flourish, I, Jehovah, have spoken, and have done [it]!'</span>
