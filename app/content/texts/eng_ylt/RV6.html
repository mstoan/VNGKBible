<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV6_2" data-id="RV6_2">and I saw, and lo, a white horse, and he who is sitting upon  it is having a bow, and there was given to him a crown, and he  went forth overcoming, and that he may overcome.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV6_3" data-id="RV6_3">And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second  living creature saying, `Come and behold!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV6_4" data-id="RV6_4">and there went forth another horse -- red, and to him who is  sitting upon it, there was given to him to take the peace from  the land, and that one another they may slay, and there was  given to him a great sword.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV6_5" data-id="RV6_5">And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living  creature saying, `Come and behold!' and I saw, and lo, a black  horse, and he who is sitting upon it is having a balance in his  hand,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV6_6" data-id="RV6_6">and I heard a voice in the midst of the four living  creatures saying, `A measure of wheat for a denary, and three  measures of barley for a denary,' and `The oil and the wine  thou mayest not injure.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV6_7" data-id="RV6_7">And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the  fourth living creature saying, `Come and behold!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV6_8" data-id="RV6_8">and I saw, and lo, a pale horse, and he who is sitting upon  him -- his name is Death, and Hades doth follow with him, and  there was given to them authority to kill, (over the fourth  part of the land,) with sword, and with hunger, and with death,  and by the beasts of the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV6_9" data-id="RV6_9">And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the  souls of those slain because of the word of God, and because  of the testimony that they held,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV6_10" data-id="RV6_10">and they were crying with a great voice, saying, `Till  when, O Master, the Holy and the True, dost Thou not judge and  take vengeance of our blood from those dwelling upon the land?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV6_11" data-id="RV6_11">and there was given to each one white robes, and it was  said to them that they may rest themselves yet a little time,  till may be fulfilled also their fellow-servants and their  brethren, who are about to be killed -- even as they.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV6_12" data-id="RV6_12">And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and lo, a great  earthquake came, and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair,  and the moon became as blood,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV6_13" data-id="RV6_13">and the stars of the heaven fell to the earth -- as a  fig-tree doth cast her winter figs, by a great wind being  shaken --</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV6_14" data-id="RV6_14">and heaven departed as a scroll rolled up, and every  mountain and island -- out of their places they were moved;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV6_15" data-id="RV6_15">and the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the  rich, and the chiefs of thousands, and the mighty, and every  servant, and every freeman, hid themselves in the dens, and in  the rocks of the mountains,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV6_16" data-id="RV6_16">and they say to the mountains and to the rocks, `Fall upon  us, and hide us from the face of Him who is sitting upon the  throne, and from the anger of the Lamb,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV6_17" data-id="RV6_17">because come did the great day of His anger, and who is  able to stand?</span>
