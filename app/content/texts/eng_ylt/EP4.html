<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_2" data-id="EP4_2">with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering,  forbearing one another in love,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_3" data-id="EP4_3">being diligent to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond  of the peace;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_4" data-id="EP4_4">one body and one Spirit, according as also ye were called in  one hope of your calling;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_5" data-id="EP4_5">one Lord, one faith, one baptism,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_6" data-id="EP4_6">one God and Father of all, who [is] over all, and through  all, and in you all,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_7" data-id="EP4_7">and to each one of you was given the grace, according to the  measure of the gift of Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_8" data-id="EP4_8">wherefore, he saith, `Having gone up on high he led captive  captivity, and gave gifts to men,' --</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_9" data-id="EP4_9">and that, he went up, what is it except that he also went  down first to the lower parts of the earth?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_10" data-id="EP4_10">he who went down is the same also who went up far above all  the heavens, that He may fill all things --</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_11" data-id="EP4_11">and He gave some [as] apostles, and some [as] prophets, and  some [as] proclaimers of good news, and some [as] shepherds and  teachers,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_12" data-id="EP4_12">unto the perfecting of the saints, for a work of  ministration, for a building up of the body of the Christ,</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_15" data-id="EP4_15">and, being true in love, we may increase to Him [in] all  things, who is the head -- the Christ;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_16" data-id="EP4_16">from whom the whole body, being fitly joined together and  united, through the supply of every joint, according to the  working in the measure of each single part, the increase of  the body doth make for the building up of itself in love.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_17" data-id="EP4_17">This, then, I say, and I testify in the Lord; ye are no  more to walk, as also the other nations walk, in the vanity of  their mind,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_18" data-id="EP4_18">being darkened in the understanding, being alienated from  the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them,  because of the hardness of their heart,</span>

<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_21" data-id="EP4_21">if so be ye did hear him, and in him were taught, as truth  is in Jesus;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_22" data-id="EP4_22">ye are to put off concerning the former behaviour the old  man, that is corrupt according to the desires of the deceit,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_23" data-id="EP4_23">and to be renewed in the spirit of your mind,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_24" data-id="EP4_24">and to put on the new man, which, according to God, was  created in righteousness and kindness of the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_25" data-id="EP4_25">Wherefore, putting away the lying, speak truth each with  his neighbour, because we are members one of another;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_26" data-id="EP4_26">be angry and do not sin; let not the sun go down upon your  wrath,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_27" data-id="EP4_27">neither give place to the devil;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_28" data-id="EP4_28">whoso is stealing let him no more steal, but rather let him  labour, working the thing that is good with the hands, that he  may have to impart to him having need.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_29" data-id="EP4_29">Let no corrupt word out of your mouth go forth, but what is  good unto the needful building up, that it may give grace to  the hearers;</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_30" data-id="EP4_30">and make not sorrowful the Holy Spirit of God, in which ye  were sealed to a day of redemption.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_31" data-id="EP4_31">Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and  evil-speaking, be put away from you, with all malice,</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_32" data-id="EP4_32">and become one to another kind, tender-hearted, forgiving  one another, according as also God in Christ did forgive you.</span>
