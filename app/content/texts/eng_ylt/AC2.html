<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_2" data-id="AC2_2">and there came suddenly out of the heaven a sound as of a  bearing violent breath, and it filled all the house where they  were sitting,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_3" data-id="AC2_3">and there appeared to them divided tongues, as it were of  fire; it sat also upon each one of them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_4" data-id="AC2_4">and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to  speak with other tongues, according as the Spirit was giving  them to declare.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_5" data-id="AC2_5">And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from  every nation of those under the heaven,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_6" data-id="AC2_6">and the rumour of this having come, the multitude came  together, and was confounded, because they were each one  hearing them speaking in his proper dialect,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_7" data-id="AC2_7">and they were all amazed, and did wonder, saying one unto  another, `Lo, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_8" data-id="AC2_8">and how do we hear, each in our proper dialect, in which we  were born?</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_9" data-id="AC2_9">Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and those dwelling in  Mesopotamia, in Judea also, and Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_10" data-id="AC2_10">Phrygia also, and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of Libya,  that [are] along Cyrene, and the strangers of Rome, both Jews  and proselytes,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_11" data-id="AC2_11">Cretes and Arabians, we did hear them speaking in our  tongues the great things of God.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_12" data-id="AC2_12">And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one  unto another, `What would this wish to be?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_13" data-id="AC2_13">and others mocking said, -- `They are full of sweet wine;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_14" data-id="AC2_14">and Peter having stood up with the eleven, lifted up his  voice and declared to them, `Men, Jews! and all those dwelling  in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and harken to my  sayings,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_15" data-id="AC2_15">for these are not drunken, as ye take it up, for it is the  third hour of the day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_16" data-id="AC2_16">`But this is that which hath been spoken through the  prophet Joel:</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_17" data-id="AC2_17">And it shall be in the last days, saith God, I will pour  out of My Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your  daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see  visions, and your old men shall dream dreams;</span>

<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_25" data-id="AC2_25">for David saith in regard to him: I foresaw the Lord always  before me -- because He is on my right hand -- that I may not  be moved;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_26" data-id="AC2_26">because of this was my heart cheered, and my tongue was  glad, and yet -- my flesh also shall rest on hope,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_27" data-id="AC2_27">because Thou wilt not leave my soul to hades, nor wilt Thou  give Thy Kind One to see corruption;</span>

<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_30" data-id="AC2_30">a prophet, therefore, being, and knowing that with an oath  God did swear to him, out of the fruit of his loins, according  to the flesh, to raise up the Christ, to sit upon his throne,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_31" data-id="AC2_31">having foreseen, he did speak concerning the rising again  of the Christ, that his soul was not left to hades, nor did  his flesh see corruption.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_32" data-id="AC2_32">`This Jesus did God raise up, of which we are all  witnesses;</span>

<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_34" data-id="AC2_34">for David did not go up to the heavens, and he saith  himself: The Lord saith to my lord, Sit thou at my right hand,</span>

<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_37" data-id="AC2_37">And having heard, they were pricked to the heart; they say  also to Peter, and to the rest of the apostles, `What shall we  do, men, brethren?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_38" data-id="AC2_38">and Peter said unto them, `Reform, and be baptized each of  you on the name of Jesus Christ, to remission of sins, and ye  shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit,</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_39" data-id="AC2_39">for to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all  those afar off, as many as the Lord our God shall call.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_40" data-id="AC2_40">Also with many more other words he was testifying and  exhorting, saying, `Be saved from this perverse generation;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_41" data-id="AC2_41">then those, indeed, who did gladly receive his word were  baptized, and there were added on that day, as it were, three  thousand souls,</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_42" data-id="AC2_42">and they were continuing stedfastly in the teaching of the  apostles, and the fellowship, and the breaking of the bread,  and the prayers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_43" data-id="AC2_43">And fear came on every soul, many wonders also and signs  were being done through the apostles,</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_44" data-id="AC2_44">and all those believing were at the same place, and had all  things common,</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_45" data-id="AC2_45">and the possessions and the goods they were selling, and  were parting them to all, according as any one had need.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_46" data-id="AC2_46">Daily also continuing with one accord in the temple,  breaking also at every house bread, they were partaking of food  in gladness and simplicity of heart,</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_47" data-id="AC2_47">praising God, and having favour with all the people, and  the Lord was adding those being saved every day to the  assembly.</span>
