<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_2" data-id="JM4_2">ye desire, and ye have not; ye murder, and are zealous, and  are not able to attain; ye fight and war, and ye have not,  because of your not asking;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_3" data-id="JM4_3">ye ask, and ye receive not, because evilly ye ask, that in  your pleasures ye may spend [it].</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_4" data-id="JM4_4">Adulterers and adulteresses! have ye not known that  friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever, then, may  counsel to be a friend of the world, an enemy of God he is set.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_5" data-id="JM4_5">Do ye think that emptily the Writing saith, `To envy  earnestly desireth the spirit that did dwell in us,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_6" data-id="JM4_6">and greater grace he doth give, wherefore he saith, `God  against proud ones doth set Himself up, and to lowly ones He  doth give grace?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_7" data-id="JM4_7">be subject, then, to God; stand up against the devil, and he  will flee from you;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_8" data-id="JM4_8">draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you; cleanse  hands, ye sinners! and purify hearts, ye two-souled!</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_9" data-id="JM4_9">be exceeding afflicted, and mourn, and weep, let your  laughter to mourning be turned, and the joy to heaviness;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_10" data-id="JM4_10">be made low before the Lord, and He shall exalt you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_11" data-id="JM4_11">Speak not one against another, brethren; he who is speaking  against a brother, and is judging his brother, doth speak  against law, and doth judge law, and if law thou dost judge,  thou art not a doer of law but a judge;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_12" data-id="JM4_12">one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy;  thou -- who art thou that dost judge the other?</span>
