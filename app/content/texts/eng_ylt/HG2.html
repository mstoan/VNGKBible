<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HG2_5" data-id="HG2_5">The thing that I covenanted with you, In your coming forth  from Egypt, And My Spirit is remaining in your midst, fear not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HG2_6" data-id="HG2_6">For thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Yet once more -- it [is] a  little, And I am shaking the heavens and the earth, And the  sea, and the dry land,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HG2_7" data-id="HG2_7">And I have shaken all the nations, And they have come [to]  the desire of all the nations, And I have filled this house  [with] honour, Said Jehovah of Hosts.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HG2_11" data-id="HG2_11">Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: `Ask, I pray thee, the priests  [of] the law, saying:</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HG2_12" data-id="HG2_12">Lo, one doth carry holy flesh in the skirt of his garment,  and he hath come with his skirt against the bread, or against  the pottage, or against the wine, or against the oil, or  against any food -- is it holy?'

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HG2_13" data-id="HG2_13">And Haggai saith, `If the unclean of body doth come against  any of these, is it unclean?' And the priests answer and say,  `It is unclean.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HG2_14" data-id="HG2_14">And Haggai answereth and saith, `So [is] this people, and  so [is] this nation before Me -- an affirmation of Jehovah --  and so [is] every work of their hands, and that which they  bring near there -- it is unclean.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HG2_15" data-id="HG2_15">And now, lay [it], I pray you, to your heart, From this  day, and onwards, Before the laying of stone to stone in the  temple of Jehovah.</span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v HG2_18" data-id="HG2_18">Set [it], I pray you, to your heart, from this day and  onwards, from the twenty and fourth day of the ninth [month],  even from the day that the temple of Jehovah hath been founded,  set [it] to your heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v HG2_19" data-id="HG2_19">Is the seed yet in the barn? And hitherto the vine and the  fig, And the pomegranate, and the olive-tree, Have not borne --  from this day I bless.'</span>
