<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_2" data-id="ZP1_2">I utterly consume all from off the face of the ground, An  affirmation of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_3" data-id="ZP1_3">I consume man and beast, I consume fowl of the heavens, and  fishes of the sea, And the stumbling-blocks -- the wicked, And  I have cut off man from the face of the ground, An affirmation  of Jehovah,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_4" data-id="ZP1_4">And stretched out My hand against Judah, And against all  inhabiting Jerusalem, And cut off from this place the remnant  of Baal, The name of the idolatrous priests, with the priests,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_5" data-id="ZP1_5">And those bowing themselves On the roofs to the host of the  heavens, And those bowing themselves, Swearing to Jehovah, and  swearing by Malcham,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_6" data-id="ZP1_6">And those removing from after Jehovah, And who have not  sought Jehovah, nor besought Him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_7" data-id="ZP1_7">Hush! because of the Lord Jehovah, For near [is] a day of  Jehovah, For prepared hath Jehovah a sacrifice, He hath  sanctified His invited ones.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_8" data-id="ZP1_8">And it hath come to pass, In the day of the sacrifice of  Jehovah, That I have laid a charge on the heads, And on sons of  the king, And on all putting on strange clothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_9" data-id="ZP1_9">And I have laid a charge on every one Who is leaping over  the threshold in that day, Who are filling the house of their  masters [With] violence and deceit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_10" data-id="ZP1_10">And there hath been in that day, An affirmation of Jehovah,  The noise of a cry from the fish-gate, And of a howling from  the Second, And of great destruction from the hills.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_11" data-id="ZP1_11">Howl, ye inhabitants of the hollow place, For cut off hath  been all the merchant people, Cut off have been all bearing  silver.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_12" data-id="ZP1_12">And it hath come to pass, at that time, I search Jerusalem  with lights, And I have laid a charge on the men Who are  hardened on their preserved things, Who are saying in their  heart: Jehovah doth no good, nor doth He evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_13" data-id="ZP1_13">And their wealth hath been for a spoil, And their houses  for desolation, And they have built houses, and do not inhabit,  And they have planted vineyards, And they do not drink their  wine.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_14" data-id="ZP1_14">Near [is] the great day of Jehovah, Near, and hasting  exceedingly, The noise of the day of Jehovah, Bitterly shriek  there doth a mighty one.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_15" data-id="ZP1_15">A day of wrath [is] that day, A day of adversity and  distress, A day of waste and desolation, A day of darkness and  gloominess, A day of cloud and thick darkness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_16" data-id="ZP1_16">A day of trumpet and shouting against the fenced cities,  And against the high corners.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_17" data-id="ZP1_17">And I have sent distress to men, And they have walked as  the blind, For against Jehovah they have sinned, And poured out  is their blood as dust, And their flesh [is] as dung.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_18" data-id="ZP1_18">Even their silver, even their gold, Is not able to deliver  them in a day of the wrath of Jehovah, And in the fire of His  jealousy consumed is the whole land, For only a hastened end  doth He make Of all the inhabitants of the land!</span>
