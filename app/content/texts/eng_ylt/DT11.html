<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_2" data-id="DT11_2">and ye have known to-day -- for it is not your sons who  have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement of  Jehovah your God, His greatness, His strong hand, and His  stretched-out arm,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_3" data-id="DT11_3">and His signs, and His doings, which He hath done in the  midst of Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to all his land;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_4" data-id="DT11_4">and that which He hath done to the force of Egypt, to its  horses, and to its chariot, when He hath caused the waters of  the Red Sea to flow against their faces in their pursuing after  them, and Jehovah destroyeth them, unto this day;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_5" data-id="DT11_5">and that which He hath done to you in the wilderness, till  your coming in unto this place;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_6" data-id="DT11_6">and that which He hath done to Dathan, and to Abiram, sons  of Eliab, sons of Reuben, when the earth hath opened her mouth  and swalloweth them, and their houses, and their tents, and all  that liveth, which is at their feet, in the midst of all  Israel:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_7" data-id="DT11_7">`-- But [it is] your eyes which are seeing all the great  work of Jehovah, which He hath done;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_8" data-id="DT11_8">and ye have kept all the command which I am commanding thee  to-day, so that ye are strong, and have gone in, and possessed  the land whither ye are passing over to possess it,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_9" data-id="DT11_9">and so that ye prolong days on the ground which Jehovah  hath sworn to your fathers to give to them and to their seed --  a land flowing with milk and honey.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_10" data-id="DT11_10">`For the land whither thou art going in to possess it, is  not as the land of Egypt whence ye have come out, where thou  sowest thy seed, and hast watered with thy foot, as a garden of  the green herb;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_11" data-id="DT11_11">but the land whither ye are passing over to possess it,  [is] a land of hills and valleys; of the rain of the heavens it  drinketh water;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_12" data-id="DT11_12">a land which Jehovah thy God is searching; continually  [are] the eyes of Jehovah thy God upon it, from the beginning  of the year even unto the latter end of the year.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_13" data-id="DT11_13">`And it hath been -- if thou hearken diligently unto My  commands which I am commanding you to-day, to love Jehovah your  God, and to serve Him with all your heart, and with all your  soul --</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_14" data-id="DT11_14">that I have given the rain of your land in its season --  sprinkling and gathered -- and thou hast gathered thy corn, and  thy new wine, and thine oil,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_15" data-id="DT11_15">and I have given herbs in thy field for thy cattle, and  thou hast eaten, and been satisfied.</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_17" data-id="DT11_17">and the anger of Jehovah hath burned against you, and He  hath restrained the heavens, and there is no rain, and the  ground doth not give her increase, and ye have perished hastily  from off the good land which Jehovah is giving to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_18" data-id="DT11_18">`And ye have placed these my words on your heart, and on  your soul, and have bound them for a sign on your hand, and  they have been for frontlets between your eyes;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_19" data-id="DT11_19">and ye have taught them to your sons, by speaking of them  in thy sitting in thy house, and in thy going in the way, and  in thy lying down, and in thy rising up,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_20" data-id="DT11_20">and hast written them on the side-posts of thy house, and  on thy gates,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_21" data-id="DT11_21">so that your days are multiplied, and the days of your  sons, on the ground which Jehovah hath sworn to your fathers to  give to them, as the days of the heavens on the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_22" data-id="DT11_22">`For, if ye diligently keep all this command which I am  commanding you -- to do it, to love Jehovah your God, to walk  in all His ways, and to cleave to Him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_23" data-id="DT11_23">then hath Jehovah dispossessed all these nations from  before you, and ye have possessed nations, greater and mightier  than you;</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_24" data-id="DT11_24">every place on which the sole of your foot treadeth is  yours; from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the  river Phrat, even unto the farther sea is your border;</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_25" data-id="DT11_25">no man doth station himself in your presence; your dread  and your fear doth Jehovah your God put on the face of all the  land on which ye tread, as He hath spoken to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_26" data-id="DT11_26">`See, I am setting before you to-day a blessing and a  reviling:</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_27" data-id="DT11_27">the blessing, when ye hearken unto the commands of Jehovah  your God, which I am commanding you to-day;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_28" data-id="DT11_28">and the reviling, if ye do not hearken unto the commands  of Jehovah your God, and have turned aside out of the way which  I am commanding you to-day, to go after other gods which ye  have not known.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_29" data-id="DT11_29">`And it hath been, when Jehovah thy God doth bring thee in  unto the land whither thou art going in to possess it, that  thou hast given the blessing on mount Gerizim, and the reviling  on mount Ebal;</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_30" data-id="DT11_30">are they not beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the  going in of the sun, in the land of the Canaanite, who is  dwelling in the plain over-against Gilgal, near the oaks of  Moreh?</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_31" data-id="DT11_31">for ye are passing over the Jordan to go in to possess the  land which Jehovah your God is giving to you; and ye have  possessed it, and dwelt in it,</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_32" data-id="DT11_32">and observed to do all the statutes and the judgments  which I am setting before you to day.</span>
