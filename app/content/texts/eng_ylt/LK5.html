<div class="c">5</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_1" data-id="LK5_1">And it came to pass, in the multitude pressing on him to  hear the word of God, that he was standing beside the lake of  Gennesaret,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_2" data-id="LK5_2">and he saw two boats standing beside the lake, and the  fishers, having gone away from them, were washing the nets,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_3" data-id="LK5_3">and having entered into one of the boats, that was Simon's,  he asked him to put back a little from the land, and having sat  down, was teaching the multitudes out of the boat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_4" data-id="LK5_4">And when he left off speaking, he said unto Simon, `Put back  to the deep, and let down your nets for a draught;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_5" data-id="LK5_5">and Simon answering said to him, `Master, through the whole  night, having laboured, we have taken nothing, but at thy  saying I will let down the net.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_6" data-id="LK5_6">And having done this, they enclosed a great multitude of  fishes, and their net was breaking,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_7" data-id="LK5_7">and they beckoned to the partners, who [are] in the other  boat, having come, to help them; and they came, and filled both  the boats, so that they were sinking.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_8" data-id="LK5_8">And Simon Peter having seen, fell down at the knees of  Jesus, saying, `Depart from me, because I am a sinful man, O  lord;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_9" data-id="LK5_9">for astonishment seized him, and all those with him, at the  draught of the fishes that they took,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_10" data-id="LK5_10">and in like manner also James and John, sons of Zebedee,  who were partners with Simon; and Jesus said unto Simon, `Fear  not, henceforth thou shalt be catching men;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_11" data-id="LK5_11">and they, having brought the boats upon the land, having  left all, did follow him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_12" data-id="LK5_12">And it came to pass, in his being in one of the cities,  that lo, a man full of leprosy, and having seen Jesus, having  fallen on [his] face, he besought him, saying, `Sir, if thou  mayest will, thou art able to cleanse me;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_13" data-id="LK5_13">and having stretched forth [his] hand, he touched him,  having said, `I will; be thou cleansed;' and immediately the  leprosy went away from him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_14" data-id="LK5_14">And he charged him to tell no one, `But, having gone away,  shew thyself to the priest, and bring near for thy cleansing  according as Moses directed, for a testimony to them;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_15" data-id="LK5_15">but the more was the report going abroad concerning him,  and great multitudes were coming together to hear, and to be  healed by him of their infirmities,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_16" data-id="LK5_16">and he was withdrawing himself in the desert places and was  praying.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_17" data-id="LK5_17">And it came to pass, on one of the days, that he was  teaching, and there were sitting by Pharisees and teachers of  the Law, who were come out of every village of Galilee, and  Judea, and Jerusalem, and the power of the Lord was -- to heal  them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_18" data-id="LK5_18">And lo, men bearing upon a couch a man, who hath been  struck with palsy, and they were seeking to bring him in, and  to place before him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_19" data-id="LK5_19">and not having found by what way they may bring him in  because of the multitude, having gone up on the house-top,  through the tiles they let him down, with the little couch,  into the midst before Jesus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_20" data-id="LK5_20">and he having seen their faith, said to him, `Man, thy sins  have been forgiven thee.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_21" data-id="LK5_21">And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying,  `Who is this that doth speak evil words? who is able to  forgive sins, except God only?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_22" data-id="LK5_22">And Jesus having known their reasonings, answering, said  unto them, `What reason ye in your hearts?</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_23" data-id="LK5_23">which is easier -- to say, Thy sins have been forgiven  thee? or to say, Arise, and walk?</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_24" data-id="LK5_24">`And that ye may know that the Son of Man hath authority  upon the earth to forgive sins -- (he said to the one struck  with palsy) -- I say to thee, Arise, and having taken up thy  little couch, be going on to thy house.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_25" data-id="LK5_25">And presently having risen before them, having taken up  [that] on which he was lying, he went away to his house,  glorifying God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_26" data-id="LK5_26">and astonishment took all, and they were glorifying God,  and were filled with fear, saying -- `We saw strange things  to-day.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_27" data-id="LK5_27">And after these things he went forth, and beheld a  tax-gatherer, by name Levi, sitting at the tax-office, and said  to him, `Be following me;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_28" data-id="LK5_28">and he, having left all, having arisen, did follow him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_29" data-id="LK5_29">And Levi made a great entertainment to him in his house,  and there was a great multitude of tax-gatherers and others who  were with them reclining (at meat),</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_30" data-id="LK5_30">and the scribes and the Pharisees among them were murmuring  at his disciples, saying, `Wherefore with tax-gatherers and  sinners do ye eat and drink?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_31" data-id="LK5_31">And Jesus answering said unto them, `They who are well have  no need of a physician, but they that are ill:</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_32" data-id="LK5_32">I came not to call righteous men, but sinners, to  reformation.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_33" data-id="LK5_33">And they said unto him, `Wherefore do the disciples of John  fast often, and make supplications -- in like manner also  those of the Pharisees -- but thine do eat and drink?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_34" data-id="LK5_34">And he said unto them, `Are ye able to make the sons of the  bride-chamber -- in the bridegroom being with them -- to fast?</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_35" data-id="LK5_35">but days will come, and, when the bridegroom may be taken  away from them, then they shall fast in those days.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_36" data-id="LK5_36">And he spake also a simile unto them -- `No one a patch of  new clothing doth put on old clothing, and if otherwise, the  new also doth make a rent, and with the old the patch doth not  agree, that [is] from the new.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_37" data-id="LK5_37">`And no one doth put new wine into old skins, and if  otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins, and itself will  be poured out, and the skins will be destroyed;</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_38" data-id="LK5_38">but new wine into new skins is to be put, and both are  preserved together;</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK5_39" data-id="LK5_39">and no one having drunk old [wine], doth immediately wish  new, for he saith, The old is better.'</span>
