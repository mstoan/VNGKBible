<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_23" data-id="EK37_23">Nor are they defiled any more with their idols, And with  their abominations, And with any of their transgressions, And I  have saved them out of all their dwellings, In which they have  sinned, And I have cleansed them, And they have been to Me for  a people, And I -- I am to them for God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_24" data-id="EK37_24">And My servant David [is] king over them, And one shepherd  have they all, And in My judgments they go, And My statutes  they keep, and have done them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_25" data-id="EK37_25">And they have dwelt on the land that I gave to My servant,  to Jacob, In which your fathers have dwelt, And they have dwelt  on it, they and their sons, And their son's sons -- unto the  age, And David My servant [is] their prince -- to the age.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_26" data-id="EK37_26">And I have made to them a covenant of peace, A covenant  age-during it is with them, And I have placed them, and  multiplied them, And placed My sanctuary in their midst -- to  the age.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_27" data-id="EK37_27">And My tabernacle hath been over them, And I have been to  them for God, And they have been to Me for a people.</span>
