<div class="c">11</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_1" data-id="C211_1">O that ye were bearing with me a little of the folly, but  ye also do bear with me:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_2" data-id="C211_2">for I am zealous for you with zeal of God, for I did  betroth you to one husband, a pure virgin, to present to  Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_3" data-id="C211_3">and I fear, lest, as the serpent did beguile Eve in his  subtilty, so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity  that [is] in the Christ;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_4" data-id="C211_4">for if, indeed, he who is coming doth preach another Jesus  whom we did not preach, or another Spirit ye receive which ye  did not receive, or other good news which ye did not accept --  well were ye bearing [it],</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_5" data-id="C211_5">for I reckon that I have been nothing behind the very  chiefest apostles,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_6" data-id="C211_6">and even if unlearned in word -- yet not in knowledge, but  in every thing we were made manifest in all things to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_7" data-id="C211_7">The sin did I do -- myself humbling that ye might be  exalted, because freely the good news of God I did proclaim to  you?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_8" data-id="C211_8">other assemblies I did rob, having taken wages, for your  ministration;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_9" data-id="C211_9">and being present with you, and having been in want, I was  chargeable to no one, for my lack did the brethren supply --  having come from Macedonia -- and in everything burdenless to  you I did keep myself, and will keep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_10" data-id="C211_10">The truth of Christ is in me, because this boasting shall  not be stopped in regard to me in the regions of Achaia;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_11" data-id="C211_11">wherefore? because I do not love you? God hath known!</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_12" data-id="C211_12">and what I do, I also will do, that I may cut off the  occasion of those wishing an occasion, that in that which they  boast they may be found according as we also;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_13" data-id="C211_13">for those such [are] false apostles, deceitful workers,  transforming themselves into apostles of Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_14" data-id="C211_14">and no wonder -- for even the Adversary doth transform  himself into a messenger of light;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_15" data-id="C211_15">no great thing, then, if also his ministrants do transform  themselves as ministrants of righteousness -- whose end shall  be according to their works.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_16" data-id="C211_16">Again I say, may no one think me to be a fool; and if  otherwise, even as a fool receive me, that I also a little may  boast.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_17" data-id="C211_17">That which I speak, I speak not according to the Lord, but  as in foolishness, in this the confidence of boasting;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_18" data-id="C211_18">since many boast according to the flesh, I also will  boast:</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_19" data-id="C211_19">for gladly do ye bear with the fools -- being wise,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_20" data-id="C211_20">for ye bear, if any one is bringing you under bondage, if  any one doth devour, if any one doth take away, if any one doth  exalt himself, if any one on the face doth smite you;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_21" data-id="C211_21">in reference to dishonour I speak, how that we were weak,  and in whatever any one is bold -- in foolishness I say [it] --  I also am bold.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_22" data-id="C211_22">Hebrews are they? I also! Israelites are they? I also!  seed of Abraham are they? I also!</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_23" data-id="C211_23">ministrants of Christ are they? -- as beside myself I  speak -- I more; in labours more abundantly, in stripes above  measure, in prisons more frequently, in deaths many times;</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_24" data-id="C211_24">from Jews five times forty [stripes] save one I did  receive;</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_25" data-id="C211_25">thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice  was I shipwrecked, a night and a day in the deep I have passed;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_26" data-id="C211_26">journeyings many times, perils of rivers, perils of  robbers, perils from kindred, perils from nations, perils in  city, perils in wilderness, perils in sea, perils among false  brethren;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_27" data-id="C211_27">in laboriousness and painfulness, in watchings many times,  in hunger and thirst, in fastings many times, in cold and  nakedness;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_28" data-id="C211_28">apart from the things without -- the crowding upon me that  is daily -- the care of all the assemblies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_29" data-id="C211_29">Who is infirm, and I am not infirm? who is stumbled, and I  am not fired;</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_30" data-id="C211_30">if to boast it behoveth [me], of the things of my  infirmity I will boast;</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_31" data-id="C211_31">the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ -- who is  blessed to the ages -- hath known that I do not lie! --</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_32" data-id="C211_32">In Damascus the ethnarch of Aretas the king was watching  the city of the Damascenes, wishing to seize me,</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_33" data-id="C211_33">and through a window in a rope basket I was let down,  through the wall, and fled out of his hands.</span>
