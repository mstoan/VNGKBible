<div class="c">29</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_1" data-id="JR29_1">And these [are] words of the letter that Jeremiah the  prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the remnant of the elders of  the removal, and unto the priests, and unto the prophets, and  unto all the people -- whom Nebuchadnezzar removed from  Jerusalem to Babylon,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_2" data-id="JR29_2">After the going forth of Jeconiah the king, and the  mistress, and the officers, heads of Judah and Jerusalem, and  the artificer, and the smith, from Jerusalem --</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_3" data-id="JR29_3">By the hand of Eleasah son of Shaphan, and Gemariah son of  Hilkijah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Nebuchadnezzar  king of Babylon -- to Babylon, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_4" data-id="JR29_4">`Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, to all the  removal that I removed from Jerusalem to Babylon,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_5" data-id="JR29_5">Build ye houses, and abide; and plant ye gardens, and eat  their fruit;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_6" data-id="JR29_6">Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take for  your sons wives, and your daughters give to husbands, and they  bear sons and daughters; and multiply there, and ye are not  few;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_7" data-id="JR29_7">And seek the peace of the city whither I have removed you,  and pray for it unto Jehovah, for in its peace ye have peace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_8" data-id="JR29_8">`For thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, Let not  your prophets who [are] in your midst, and your diviners, lift  you up, nor hearken ye unto their dreams, thay ye are causing  [them] to dream;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_9" data-id="JR29_9">For with falsehood they are prophesying to you in My name;  I have not sent them, an affirmation of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_10" data-id="JR29_10">`For thus said Jehovah, Surely at the fulness of Babylon  -- seventy years -- I inspect you, and have established towards  you My good word, to bring you back unto this place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_11" data-id="JR29_11">For I have known the thoughts that I am thinking towards  you -- an affirmation of Jehovah; thoughts of peace, and not of  evil, to give to you posterity and hope.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_12" data-id="JR29_12">`And ye have called Me, and have gone, and have prayed  unto Me, and I have hearkened unto you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_13" data-id="JR29_13">And ye have sought Me, and have found, for ye seek Me with  all your heart;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_14" data-id="JR29_14">And I have been found of you -- an affirmation of Jehovah;  and I have turned back [to] your captivity, and have gathered  you out of all the nations, and out of all the places whither I  have driven you -- an affirmation of Jehovah -- and I have  brought you back unto the place whence I removed you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_15" data-id="JR29_15">`Because ye have said, Jehovah hath raised up to us  prophets in Babylon,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_16" data-id="JR29_16">Surely thus said Jehovah concerning the king who is  sitting on the throne of David, and concerning all the people  that is dwelling in this city, your brethren who went not forth  with you in the removal;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_17" data-id="JR29_17">Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, Lo, I am sending among them  the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and I have given  them up as figs that [are] vile, that are not eaten for  badness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_18" data-id="JR29_18">And I have pursued after them with sword, with famine, and  with pestilence, and have given them for a trembling to all  kingdoms of the earth, for a curse and for an astonishment, and  for a hissing, and for a reproach among all the nations whither  I have driven them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_19" data-id="JR29_19">Because that they have not hearkened unto My words -- an  affirmation of Jehovah -- that I sent unto them by My servants  the prophets, rising early and sending, and ye hearkened not --  an affirmation of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_20" data-id="JR29_20">`And ye, hear ye a word of Jehovah, all ye of the  captivity that I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_21" data-id="JR29_21">Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, concerning Ahab  son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who  are prophesying to you in My name falsehood: Lo, I am giving  them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he  hath smitten them before your eyes,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_22" data-id="JR29_22">And taken from them hath been a reviling by all the  removed of Judah that [are] in Babylon, saying, Jehovah doth  set thee as Zedekiah, and as Ahab, whom the king of Babylon  roasted with fire;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_23" data-id="JR29_23">Because that they have done folly in Israel, and commit  adultery with the wives of their neighbours, and speak a word  in My name falsely that I have not commanded them, and I [am]  He who knoweth and a witness -- an affirmation of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_24" data-id="JR29_24">`And unto Shemaiah the Nehelamite thou dost speak, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_25" data-id="JR29_25">Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, saying, Because  that thou hast sent in thy name letters unto all the people who  [are] in Jerusalem, and unto Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the  priest, and unto all the priests, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_26" data-id="JR29_26">Jehovah hath made thee priest instead of Jehoiada the  priest, for there being inspectors of the house of Jehovah, for  every one mad and making himself a prophet, and thou hast put  him unto the torture and unto the stocks.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_27" data-id="JR29_27">And now, why hast thou not pushed against Jeremiah of  Anathoth, who is making himself a prophet to you?</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_28" data-id="JR29_28">Because that he hath sent unto us to Babylon, saying, It  [is] long, build ye houses, and abide; and plant ye gardens,  and eat their fruit.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_29" data-id="JR29_29">And Zephaniah the priest readeth this letter in the ears  of Jeremiah the prophet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_30" data-id="JR29_30">And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_31" data-id="JR29_31">`Send unto all the removal, saying, Thus said Jehovah  concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite, Because that Shemaiah  prophesied to you, and I -- I have not sent him, and he doth  cause you to trust on falsehood,</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR29_32" data-id="JR29_32">Therefore, thus said Jehovah, Lo, I am seeing after  Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and after his seed, he hath none  dwelling in the midst of this people, nor doth he look on the  good that I am doing to My people -- an affirmation of Jehovah  -- for apostacy he hath spoken against Jehovah.'</span>
