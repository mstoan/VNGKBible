<div class="c">4</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_1" data-id="MK4_1">And again he began to teach by the sea, and there was  gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he, having gone  into the boat, sat in the sea, and all the multitude was near  the sea, on the land,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_2" data-id="MK4_2">and he taught them many things in similes, and he said to  them in his teaching:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_3" data-id="MK4_3">`Hearken, lo, the sower went forth to sow;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_4" data-id="MK4_4">and it came to pass, in the sowing, some fell by the way,  and the fowls of the heaven did come and devour it;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_5" data-id="MK4_5">and other fell upon the rocky ground, where it had not much  earth, and immediately it sprang forth, because of not having  depth of earth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_6" data-id="MK4_6">and the sun having risen, it was scorched, and because of  not having root it did wither;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_7" data-id="MK4_7">and other fell toward the thorns, and the thorns did come  up, and choke it, and fruit it gave not;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_8" data-id="MK4_8">and other fell to the good ground, and was giving fruit,  coming up and increasing, and it bare, one thirty-fold, and one  sixty, and one an hundred.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_9" data-id="MK4_9">And he said to them, `He who is having ears to hear -- let  him hear.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_10" data-id="MK4_10">And when he was alone, those about him, with the twelve,  did ask him of the simile,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_11" data-id="MK4_11">and he said to them, `To you it hath been given to know the  secret of the reign of God, but to those who are without, in  similes are all the things done;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_12" data-id="MK4_12">that seeing they may see and not perceive, and hearing they  may hear and not understand, lest they may turn, and the sins  may be forgiven them.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_13" data-id="MK4_13">And he saith to them, `Have ye not known this simile? and  how shall ye know all the similes?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_14" data-id="MK4_14">He who is sowing doth sow the word;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_15" data-id="MK4_15">and these are they by the way where the word is sown: and  whenever they may hear, immediately cometh the Adversary, and  he taketh away the word that hath been sown in their hearts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_16" data-id="MK4_16">`And these are they, in like manner, who on the rocky  ground are sown: who, whenever they may hear the word,  immediately with joy do receive it,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_17" data-id="MK4_17">and have not root in themselves, but are temporary;  afterward tribulation or persecution having come because of the  word, immediately they are stumbled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_18" data-id="MK4_18">`And these are they who toward the thorns are sown: these  are they who are hearing the word,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_19" data-id="MK4_19">and the anxieties of this age, and the deceitfulness of the  riches, and the desires concerning the other things, entering  in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_20" data-id="MK4_20">`And these are they who on the good ground have been sown:  who do hear the word, and receive, and do bear fruit, one  thirty-fold, and one sixty, and one an hundred.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_21" data-id="MK4_21">And he said to them, `Doth the lamp come that under the  measure it may be put, or under the couch -- not that it may be  put on the lamp-stand?</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_22" data-id="MK4_22">for there is not anything hid that may not be manifested,  nor was anything kept hid but that it may come to light.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_23" data-id="MK4_23">If any hath ears to hear -- let him hear.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_24" data-id="MK4_24">And he said to them, `Take heed what ye hear; in what  measure ye measure, it shall be measured to you; and to you who  hear it shall be added;</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_25" data-id="MK4_25">for whoever may have, there shall be given to him, and  whoever hath not, also that which he hath shall be taken from  him.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_26" data-id="MK4_26">And he said, `Thus is the reign of God: as if a man may  cast the seed on the earth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_27" data-id="MK4_27">and may sleep, and may rise night and day, and the seed  spring up and grow, he hath not known how;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_28" data-id="MK4_28">for of itself doth the earth bear fruit, first a blade,  afterwards an ear, afterwards full corn in the ear;</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_29" data-id="MK4_29">and whenever the fruit may yield itself, immediately he  doth send forth the sickle, because the harvest hath come.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_30" data-id="MK4_30">And he said, `To what may we liken the reign of God, or in  what simile may we compare it?</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_31" data-id="MK4_31">As a grain of mustard, which, whenever it may be sown on  the earth, is less than any of the seeds that are on the earth;</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_32" data-id="MK4_32">and whenever it may be sown, it cometh up, and doth become  greater than any of the herbs, and doth make great branches, so  that under its shade the fowls of the heaven are able to rest.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_33" data-id="MK4_33">And with many such similes he was speaking to them the  word, as they were able to hear,</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_34" data-id="MK4_34">and without a simile he was not speaking to them, and by  themselves, to his disciples he was expounding all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_35" data-id="MK4_35">And he saith to them on that day, evening having come, `We  may pass over to the other side;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_36" data-id="MK4_36">and having let away the multitude, they take him up as he  was in the boat, and other little boats also were with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_37" data-id="MK4_37">And there cometh a great storm of wind, and the waves were  beating on the boat, so that it is now being filled,</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_38" data-id="MK4_38">and he himself was upon the stern, upon the pillow  sleeping, and they wake him up, and say to him, `Teacher, art  thou not caring that we perish?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_39" data-id="MK4_39">And having waked up, he rebuked the wind, and said to the  sea, `Peace, be stilled;' and the wind did lull, and there was  a great calm:</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_40" data-id="MK4_40">and he said to them, `Why are ye so fearful? how have ye  not faith?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_41" data-id="MK4_41">and they feared a great fear, and said one to another,  `Who, then, is this, that even the wind and the sea do obey  him?'</span>
