<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_2" data-id="PP4_2">Euodia I exhort, and Syntyche I exhort, to be of the same  mind in the Lord;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_3" data-id="PP4_3">and I ask also thee, genuine yoke-fellow, be assisting those  women who in the good news did strive along with me, with  Clement also, and the others, my fellow-workers, whose names  [are] in the book of life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_4" data-id="PP4_4">Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_5" data-id="PP4_5">let your forbearance be known to all men; the Lord [is]  near;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_6" data-id="PP4_6">for nothing be anxious, but in everything by prayer, and by  supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made  known unto God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_7" data-id="PP4_7">and the peace of God, that is surpassing all understanding,  shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_8" data-id="PP4_8">As to the rest, brethren, as many things as are true, as  many as [are] grave, as many as [are] righteous, as many as  [are] pure, as many as [are] lovely, as many as [are] of good  report, if any worthiness, and if any praise, these things  think upon;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_9" data-id="PP4_9">the things that also ye did learn, and receive, and hear,  and saw in me, those do, and the God of the peace shall be  with you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_10" data-id="PP4_10">And I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at length ye  flourished again in caring for me, for which also ye were  caring, and lacked opportunity;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_11" data-id="PP4_11">not that in respect of want I say [it], for I did learn in  the things in which I am -- to be content;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_12" data-id="PP4_12">I have known both to be abased, and I have known to abound;  in everything and in all things I have been initiated, both to  be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_13" data-id="PP4_13">For all things I have strength, in Christ's strengthening  me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_14" data-id="PP4_14">but ye did well, having communicated with my tribulation;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_15" data-id="PP4_15">and ye have known, even ye Philippians, that in the  beginning of the good news when I went forth from Macedonia,  no assembly did communicate with me in regard to giving and  receiving except ye only;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_16" data-id="PP4_16">because also in Thessalonica, both once and again to my  need ye sent;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_17" data-id="PP4_17">not that I seek after the gift, but I seek after the fruit  that is overflowing to your account;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_18" data-id="PP4_18">and I have all things, and abound; I am filled, having  received from Epaphroditus the things from you -- an odour of  a sweet smell -- a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God:</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_19" data-id="PP4_19">and my God shall supply all your need, according to His  riches in glory in Christ Jesus;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_20" data-id="PP4_20">and to God, even our Father, [is] the glory -- to the ages  of the ages. Amen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_21" data-id="PP4_21">Salute ye every saint in Christ Jesus; there salute you the  brethren with me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_22" data-id="PP4_22">there salute you all the saints, and specially those of  Caesar's house;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_23" data-id="PP4_23">the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [is] with you all. Amen.</span>
