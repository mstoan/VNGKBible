<div class="c">3</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_1" data-id="HB3_1">Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling,  consider the apostle and chief priest of our profession,  Christ Jesus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_2" data-id="HB3_2">being stedfast to Him who did appoint him, as also Moses in  all his house,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_3" data-id="HB3_3">for of more glory than Moses hath this one been counted  worthy, inasmuch as more honour than the house hath he who doth  build it,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_4" data-id="HB3_4">for every house is builded by some one, and He who the all  things did build [is] God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_5" data-id="HB3_5">and Moses indeed [was] stedfast in all his house, as an  attendant, for a testimony of those things that were to be  spoken,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_6" data-id="HB3_6">and Christ, as a Son over his house, whose house are we, if  the boldness and the rejoicing of the hope unto the end we  hold fast.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_7" data-id="HB3_7">Wherefore, (as the Holy Spirit saith, `To-day, if His voice  ye may hear --</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_8" data-id="HB3_8">ye may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation, in the  day of the temptation in the wilderness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_9" data-id="HB3_9">in which tempt Me did your fathers, they did prove Me, and  saw My works forty years;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_10" data-id="HB3_10">wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said,  Always do they go astray in heart, and these have not known My  ways;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_11" data-id="HB3_11">so I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest --  !')</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_12" data-id="HB3_12">See, brethren, lest there shall be in any of you an evil  heart of unbelief in the falling away from the living God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_13" data-id="HB3_13">but exhort ye one another every day, while the To-day is  called, that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness  of the sin,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_14" data-id="HB3_14">for partakers we have become of the Christ, if the  beginning of the confidence unto the end we may hold fast,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_15" data-id="HB3_15">in its being said, `To-day, if His voice ye may hear, ye  may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_16" data-id="HB3_16">for certain having heard did provoke, but not all who did  come out of Egypt through Moses;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_17" data-id="HB3_17">but with whom was He grieved forty years? was it not with  those who did sin, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_18" data-id="HB3_18">and to whom did He swear that they shall not enter into His  rest, except to those who did not believe? --</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_19" data-id="HB3_19">and we see that they were not able to enter in because of  unbelief.</span>
