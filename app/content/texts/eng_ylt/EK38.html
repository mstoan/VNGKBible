<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK38_2" data-id="EK38_2">`Son of man, set thy face unto Gog, of the land of Magog,  prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy concerning  him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK38_3" data-id="EK38_3">and thou hast said: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I [am]  against thee, O Gog, Prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK38_4" data-id="EK38_4">And I have turned thee back, And I have put hooks in thy  jaws, And have brought thee out, and all thy force, Horses and  horsemen, Clothed in perfection all of them, A numerous  assembly, [with] buckler and shield, Handling swords -- all of  them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK38_5" data-id="EK38_5">Persia, Cush, and Phut, with them, All of them [with]  shield and helmet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK38_6" data-id="EK38_6">Gomer and all its bands, The house of Togarmah of the sides  of the north, And all its bands, many peoples with thee,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK38_7" data-id="EK38_7">Be prepared, yea, prepare for thee, Thou and all thine  assemblies who are assembled unto thee, And thou hast been to  them for a guard.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK38_8" data-id="EK38_8">After many days thou art appointed, In the latter end of  the years thou comest in unto a land brought back from sword,  [A people] gathered out of many peoples, Upon mountains of  Israel, That have been for a perpetual waste, And it from the  peoples hath been brought out, And dwelt safely have all of  them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK38_9" data-id="EK38_9">And thou hast gone up -- as wasting thou comest in, As a  cloud to cover the land art thou, Thou and all thy bands, and  many peoples with thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK38_10" data-id="EK38_10">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: And it hath come to pass in  that day, Come up do things on thy heart, And thou hast thought  an evil thought,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK38_11" data-id="EK38_11">And thou hast said: I go up against a land of unwalled  villages, I go in to those at rest, dwelling confidently, All  of them are dwelling without walls, And bar and doors they have  not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK38_12" data-id="EK38_12">To take a spoil, and to take a prey, To turn back thy hand  on inhabited wastes, And on a people gathered out of nations,  Making cattle and substance, Dwelling on a high part of the  land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK38_13" data-id="EK38_13">Sheba, and Dedan, and merchants of Tarshish, And all its  young lions say to thee: To take a spoil art thou come in? To  take a prey assembled thine assembly? To bear away silver and  gold? To take away cattle and substance? To take a great spoil?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK38_14" data-id="EK38_14">Therefore, prophesy, son of man, and thou hast said to  Gog: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In that day, in the dwelling  of My people Israel safely, Dost thou not know?</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK38_15" data-id="EK38_15">And thou hast come in out of thy place, From the sides of  the north, Thou and many peoples with thee, Riding on horses --  all of them, A great assembly, and a numerous force.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK38_16" data-id="EK38_16">And thou hast come up against My people Israel, As a cloud  to cover the land, In the latter end of the days it is, And I  have brought thee in against My land, In order that the nations  may know Me, In My being sanctified in thee before their eyes,  O Gog.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK38_17" data-id="EK38_17">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Art thou he of whom I spake in  former days, By the hand of My servants, prophets of Israel,  Who are prophesying in those days -- years, To bring thee in  against them?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK38_18" data-id="EK38_18">And it hath come to pass, in that day, In the day of the  coming in of Gog against the land of Israel, An affirmation of  the Lord Jehovah, Come up doth My fury in My face,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK38_19" data-id="EK38_19">And in My zeal, in the fire of My wrath, I have spoken: Is  there not in that day a great rushing on the land of Israel?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK38_20" data-id="EK38_20">And rushed from My presence have fishes of the sea, And  the fowl of the heavens, And the beast of the field, And every  creeping thing that is creeping on the ground, And all men who  [are] on the face of the ground, And thrown down have been the  mountains, And fallen have the ascents, And every wall to the  earth falleth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK38_21" data-id="EK38_21">And I have called against him, to all My mountains a  sword, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah, The sword of each is  against his brother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK38_22" data-id="EK38_22">And I have been judged with him, With pestilence and with  blood, And an overflowing rain and hailstones, Fire and  brimstone I rain on him, and on his bands, And on many peoples  who [are] with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK38_23" data-id="EK38_23">And I have magnified Myself, and sanctified Myself, And I  have been known before the eyes of many nations, And they have  known that I [am] Jehovah!</span>
