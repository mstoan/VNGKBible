<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_2" data-id="P12_2">as new-born babes the word's pure milk desire ye, that in it  ye may grow,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_3" data-id="P12_3">if so be ye did taste that the Lord [is] gracious,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_4" data-id="P12_4">to whom coming -- a living stone -- by men, indeed, having  been disapproved of, but with God choice, precious,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_5" data-id="P12_5">and ye yourselves, as living stones, are built up, a  spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual  sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_6" data-id="P12_6">Wherefore, also, it is contained in the Writing: `Lo, I lay  in Zion a chief corner-stone, choice, precious, and he who is  believing on him may not be put to shame;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_7" data-id="P12_7">to you, then, who are believing [is] the preciousness; and  to the unbelieving, a stone that the builders disapproved of,  this one did become for the head of a corner,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_8" data-id="P12_8">and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence -- who are  stumbling at the word, being unbelieving, -- to which also  they were set;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_9" data-id="P12_9">and ye [are] a choice race, a royal priesthood, a holy  nation, a people acquired, that the excellences ye may shew  forth of Him who out of darkness did call you to His wondrous  light;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_10" data-id="P12_10">who [were] once not a people, and [are] now the people of  God; who had not found kindness, and now have found kindness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_11" data-id="P12_11">Beloved, I call upon [you], as strangers and sojourners, to  keep from the fleshly desires, that war against the soul,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_12" data-id="P12_12">having your behaviour among the nations right, that in that  which they speak against you as evil-doers, of the good works  having beheld, they may glorify God in a day of inspection.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_13" data-id="P12_13">Be subject, then, to every human creation, because of the  Lord, whether to a king, as the highest,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_14" data-id="P12_14">whether to governors, as to those sent through him, for  punishment, indeed, of evil-doers, and a praise of those doing  good;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_15" data-id="P12_15">because, so is the will of God, doing good, to put to  silence the ignorance of the foolish men;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_16" data-id="P12_16">as free, and not having the freedom as the cloak of the  evil, but as servants of God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_17" data-id="P12_17">to all give ye honour; the brotherhood love ye; God fear  ye; the king honour ye.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_18" data-id="P12_18">The domestics! be subjecting yourselves in all fear to the  masters, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the  cross;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_19" data-id="P12_19">for this [is] gracious, if because of conscience toward God  any one doth endure sorrows, suffering unrighteously;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_20" data-id="P12_20">for what renown [is it], if sinning and being buffeted, ye  do endure [it]? but if, doing good and suffering [for it], ye  do endure, this [is] gracious with God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_21" data-id="P12_21">for to this ye were called, because Christ also did suffer  for you, leaving to you an example, that ye may follow his  steps,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_22" data-id="P12_22">who did not commit sin, nor was guile found in his mouth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_23" data-id="P12_23">who being reviled -- was not reviling again, suffering --  was not threatening, and was committing himself to Him who is  judging righteously,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_24" data-id="P12_24">who our sins himself did bear in his body, upon the tree,  that to the sins having died, to the righteousness we may  live; by whose stripes ye were healed,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_25" data-id="P12_25">for ye were as sheep going astray, but ye turned back now  to the shepherd and overseer of your souls.</span>
