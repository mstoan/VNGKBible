<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS21_2" data-id="IS21_2">A hard vision hath been declared to me, The treacherous  dealer is dealing treacherously, And the destroyer is  destroying. Go up, O Elam, besiege, O Media, All its sighing I  have caused to cease.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS21_3" data-id="IS21_3">Therefore filled have been my loins [with] great pain,  Pangs have seized me as pangs of a travailing woman, I have  been bent down by hearing, I have been troubled by seeing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS21_4" data-id="IS21_4">Wandered hath my heart, trembling hath terrified me, The  twilight of my desire He hath made a fear to me,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS21_5" data-id="IS21_5">Arrange the table, watch in the watch-tower, Eat, drink,  rise, ye heads, anoint the shield,</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS21_9" data-id="IS21_9">And lo, this, the chariot of a man is coming, A couple of  horsemen.' And he answereth and saith: `Fallen, fallen hath  Babylon, And all the graven images of her gods He hath broken  to the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS21_10" data-id="IS21_10">O my threshing, and the son of my floor, That which I  heard from Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, I have declared to  you!'</span>
