<div class="c">7</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_1" data-id="EC7_1">Better [is] a name than good perfume, And the day of death  than the day of birth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_2" data-id="EC7_2">Better to go unto a house of mourning,  Than to go unto a  house of banqueting, For that is the end of all men, And the  living layeth [it] unto his heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_3" data-id="EC7_3">Better [is] sorrow than laughter, For by the sadness of the  face the heart becometh better.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_4" data-id="EC7_4">The heart of the wise [is] in a house of mourning, And the  heart of fools in a house of mirth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_5" data-id="EC7_5">Better to hear a rebuke of a wise man, Than [for] a man to  hear a song of fools,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_6" data-id="EC7_6">For as the noise of thorns under the pot, So [is] the  laughter of a fool, even this [is] vanity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_7" data-id="EC7_7">Surely oppression maketh the wise mad, And a gift destroyeth  the heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_8" data-id="EC7_8">Better [is] the latter end of a thing than its beginning,  Better [is] the patient of spirit, than the haughty of spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_9" data-id="EC7_9">Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry, For anger in the  bosom of fools resteth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_10" data-id="EC7_10">Say not thou, `What was it, That the former days were  better than these?' For thou hast not asked wisely of this.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_11" data-id="EC7_11">Wisdom [is] good with an inheritance, And an advantage [it  is] to those beholding the sun.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_12" data-id="EC7_12">For wisdom [is] a defense, money [is] a defence, And the  advantage of the knowledge of wisdom [is], She reviveth her  possessors.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_13" data-id="EC7_13">See the work of God, For who is able to make straight that  which  He made crooked?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_14" data-id="EC7_14">In a day of prosperity be in gladness, And in a day of evil  consider. Also this over-against that hath God made, To the  intent that man doth not find anything after him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_15" data-id="EC7_15">The whole I have considered in the days of my vanity. There  is a righteous one perishing in his righteousness, and there is  a wrong-doer prolonging [himself] in his wrong.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_16" data-id="EC7_16">Be not over-righteous, nor show thyself too wise, why art  thou desolate?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_17" data-id="EC7_17">Do not much wrong, neither be thou a fool, why dost thou  die within thy time?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_18" data-id="EC7_18">[It is] good that thou dost lay hold on this, and also,  from that withdrawest not thy hand, for whoso is fearing God  goeth out with them all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_19" data-id="EC7_19">The wisdom giveth strength to a wise man, more than wealth  the rulers who have been in a city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_20" data-id="EC7_20">Because there is not a righteous man on earth that doth  good and sinneth not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_21" data-id="EC7_21">Also to all the words that they speak give not thy heart,  that thou hear not thy servant reviling thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_22" data-id="EC7_22">For many times also hath thy heart known that thou thyself  also hast reviled others.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_23" data-id="EC7_23">All this I have tried by wisdom; I have said, `I am wise,'  and it [is] far from me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_24" data-id="EC7_24">Far off [is] that which hath been, and deep, deep, who doth  find it?</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_25" data-id="EC7_25">I have turned round, also my heart, to know and to search,  and to seek out wisdom, and reason, and to know the wrong of  folly, and of foolishness the madness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_26" data-id="EC7_26">And I am finding more bitter than death, the woman whose  heart [is] nets and snares, her hands [are] bands; the good  before God escapeth from her, but the sinner is captured by  her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_27" data-id="EC7_27">See, this I have found, said the Preacher, one to one, to  find out the reason</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_28" data-id="EC7_28">(that still my soul had sought, and I had not found), One  man, a teacher, I have found, and a woman among all these I  have not found.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_29" data-id="EC7_29">See, this alone I have found, that God made man upright,  and they -- they have sought out many devices.</span>
