<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_2" data-id="JN4_2">(though indeed Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his  disciples,)</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_3" data-id="JN4_3">he left Judea and went away again to Galilee,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_4" data-id="JN4_4">and it was behoving him to go through Samaria.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_5" data-id="JN4_5">He cometh, therefore, to a city of Samaria, called Sychar,  near to the place that Jacob gave to Joseph his son;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_6" data-id="JN4_6">and there was there a well of Jacob. Jesus therefore having  been weary from the journeying, was sitting thus on the well;  it was as it were the sixth hour;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_7" data-id="JN4_7">there cometh a woman out of Samaria to draw water. Jesus  saith to her, `Give me to drink;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_8" data-id="JN4_8">for his disciples were gone away to the city, that they may  buy victuals;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_9" data-id="JN4_9">the Samaritan woman therefore saith to him, `How dost thou,  being a Jew, ask drink from me, being a Samaritan woman?' for  Jews have no dealing with Samaritans.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_10" data-id="JN4_10">Jesus answered and said to her, `If thou hadst known the  gift of God, and who it is who is saying to thee, Give me to  drink, thou wouldest have asked him, and he would have given  thee living water.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_11" data-id="JN4_11">The woman saith to him, `Sir, thou hast not even a vessel  to draw with, and the well is deep; whence, then, hast thou the  living water?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_12" data-id="JN4_12">Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who did give us the  well, and himself out of it did drink, and his sons, and his  cattle?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_13" data-id="JN4_13">Jesus answered and said to her, `Every one who is drinking  of this water shall thirst again;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_14" data-id="JN4_14">but whoever may drink of the water that I will give him,  may not thirst -- to the age; and the water that I will give  him shall become in him a well of water, springing up to life  age-during.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_15" data-id="JN4_15">The woman saith unto him, `Sir, give me this water, that I  may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_16" data-id="JN4_16">Jesus saith to her, `Go, call thy husband, and come  hither;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_17" data-id="JN4_17">the woman answered and said, `I have not a husband.' Jesus  saith to her, `Well didst thou say -- A husband I have not;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_18" data-id="JN4_18">for five husbands thou hast had, and, now, he whom thou  hast is not thy husband; this hast thou said truly.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_19" data-id="JN4_19">The woman saith to him, `Sir, I perceive that thou art a  prophet;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_20" data-id="JN4_20">our fathers in this mountain did worship, and ye -- ye say  that in Jerusalem is the place where it behoveth to worship.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_21" data-id="JN4_21">Jesus saith to her, `Woman, believe me, that there doth  come an hour, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem,  shall ye worship the Father;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_22" data-id="JN4_22">ye worship what ye have not known; we worship what we have  known, because the salvation is of the Jews;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_23" data-id="JN4_23">but, there cometh an hour, and it now is, when the true  worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for  the Father also doth seek such to worship him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_24" data-id="JN4_24">God [is] a Spirit, and those worshipping Him, in spirit  and truth it doth behove to worship.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_25" data-id="JN4_25">The woman saith to him, `I have known that Messiah doth  come, who is called Christ, when that one may come, he will  tell us all things;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_26" data-id="JN4_26">Jesus saith to her, `I am [he], who am speaking to thee.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_27" data-id="JN4_27">And upon this came his disciples, and were wondering that  with a woman he was speaking, no one, however, said, `What  seekest thou?' or `Why speakest thou with her?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_28" data-id="JN4_28">The woman then left her water-jug, and went away to the  city, and saith to the men,</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_29" data-id="JN4_29">`Come, see a man, who told me all things -- as many as I  did; is this the Christ?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_30" data-id="JN4_30">They went forth therefore out of the city, and were coming  unto him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_31" data-id="JN4_31">And in the meanwhile his disciples were asking him, saying,  `Rabbi, eat;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_32" data-id="JN4_32">and he said to them, `I have food to eat that ye have not  known.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_33" data-id="JN4_33">The disciples then said one to another, `Did any one bring  him anything to eat?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_34" data-id="JN4_34">Jesus saith to them, `My food is, that I may do the will of  Him who sent me, and may finish His work;</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_35" data-id="JN4_35">do not say that it is yet four months, and the harvest  cometh; lo, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and see the  fields, that they are white unto harvest already.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_36" data-id="JN4_36">`And he who is reaping doth receive a reward, and doth  gather fruit to life age-during, that both he who is sowing and  he who is reaping may rejoice together;</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_37" data-id="JN4_37">for in this the saying is the true one, that one is the  sower and another the reaper.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_38" data-id="JN4_38">I sent you to reap that on which ye have not laboured;  others laboured, and ye into their labour have entered.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_39" data-id="JN4_39">And from that city many believed in him, of the Samaritans,  because of the word of the woman testifying, -- `He told me all  things -- as many as I did.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_40" data-id="JN4_40">When, then, the Samaritans came unto him, they were asking  him to remain with them, and he remained there two days;</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_41" data-id="JN4_41">and many more did believe because of his word,</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_42" data-id="JN4_42">and said to the woman -- `No more because of thy speaking  do we believe; for we ourselves have heard and known that this  is truly the Saviour of the world -- the Christ.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_43" data-id="JN4_43">And after the two days he went forth thence, and went away  to Galilee,</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_44" data-id="JN4_44">for Jesus himself testified that a prophet in his own  country shall not have honour;</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_45" data-id="JN4_45">when then, he came to Galilee, the Galileans received him,  having seen all things that he did in Jerusalem in the feast  -- for they also went to the feast.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_46" data-id="JN4_46">Jesus came, therefore, again to Cana of Galilee, where he  made the water wine, and there was a certain courtier, whose  son was ailing in Capernaum,</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_47" data-id="JN4_47">he, having heard that Jesus is come out of Judea to  Galilee, went away unto him, and was asking him that he may  come down and may heal his son, for he was about to die.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_48" data-id="JN4_48">Jesus then said unto him, `If signs and wonders ye may not  see, ye will not believe.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_49" data-id="JN4_49">The courtier saith unto him, `Sir, come down before my  child die;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_50" data-id="JN4_50">Jesus saith to him, `Be going on; thy son doth live.' And  the man believed the word that Jesus said to him, and was going  on,</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_51" data-id="JN4_51">and he now going down, his servants met him, and told,  saying -- `Thy child doth live;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_52" data-id="JN4_52">he inquired then of them the hour in which he became  better, and they said to him -- `Yesterday at the seventh hour  the fever left him;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_53" data-id="JN4_53">then the father knew that [it was] in that hour in which  Jesus said to him -- `Thy son doth live,' and he himself  believed, and his whole house;</span>
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_54" data-id="JN4_54">this again a second sign did Jesus, having come out of  Judea to Galilee.</span>
