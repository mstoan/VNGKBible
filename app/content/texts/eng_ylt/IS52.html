<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS52_2" data-id="IS52_2">Shake thyself from dust, arise, sit, O Jerusalem, Bands of  thy neck have loosed themselves, O captive, daughter of Zion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS52_3" data-id="IS52_3">For thus said Jehovah: `For nought ye have been sold, And  not by money are ye redeemed.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS52_4" data-id="IS52_4">For thus said the Lord Jehovah: `To Egypt My people went  down at first to sojourn there, And Asshur -- for nought he  hath oppressed it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS52_5" data-id="IS52_5">And now, what -- to Me here, An affirmation of Jehovah,  That taken is My people for nought? Its rulers cause howling,  -- an affirmation of Jehovah, And continually all the day My  name is despised.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS52_6" data-id="IS52_6">Therefore doth My people know My name, Therefore, in that  day, Surely I [am] He who is speaking, behold Me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS52_7" data-id="IS52_7">How comely on the mountains, Have been the feet of one  proclaiming tidings, Sounding peace, proclaiming good tidings,  Sounding salvation, Saying to Zion, `Reigned hath thy God.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS52_8" data-id="IS52_8">The voice of thy watchmen! They have lifted up the voice,  together they cry aloud, Because eye to eye they see, in  Jehovah's turning back [to] Zion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS52_9" data-id="IS52_9">Break forth, sing together, O wastes of Jerusalem, For  Jehovah hath comforted His people, He hath redeemed Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS52_10" data-id="IS52_10">Jehovah hath made bare His holy arm Before the eyes of all  the nations, And seen have all the ends of the earth, The  salvation of our God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS52_11" data-id="IS52_11">Turn aside, turn aside, go out thence, The unclean touch  not, go out from her midst, Be ye pure, who are bearing the  weapons of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS52_12" data-id="IS52_12">For not in haste do ye go out, Yea, with flight ye go not  on, For going before you [is] Jehovah, And gathering you [is]  the God of Israel!</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS52_13" data-id="IS52_13">Lo, My servant doth act wisely, He is high, and hath been  lifted up, And hath been very high.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS52_14" data-id="IS52_14">As astonished at thee have been many, (So marred by man  his appearance, And his form by sons of men.)</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS52_15" data-id="IS52_15">So doth he sprinkle many nations. Concerning him kings  shut their mouth, For that which was not recounted to them they  have seen, And that which they had not heard they have  understood!</span>
