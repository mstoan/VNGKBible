<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_2" data-id="EK44_2">And Jehovah saith unto me, `This gate is shut, it is not  opened, and none doth go in by it, for Jehovah, God of Israel,  hath come in by it, and it hath been shut.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_3" data-id="EK44_3">The prince, who [is] prince, he sitteth by it to eat bread  before Jehovah, by the way of the porch of the gate he cometh  in, and by its way he goeth out.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_4" data-id="EK44_4">And he bringeth me in the way of the north gate unto the  front of the house, and I look, and lo, filled hath the honour  of Jehovah the house of Jehovah, and I fall on my face.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_5" data-id="EK44_5">And Jehovah saith unto me, `Son of man, set thy heart, and  see with thine eyes, and with thine ears hear, all that I am  speaking with thee, of all the statutes of the house of  Jehovah, and of all its laws; and thou hast set thy heart to  the entrance of the house, with all the outlets of the  sanctuary,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_6" data-id="EK44_6">and hast said unto the rebellious, unto the house of  Israel: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Enough to you -- of all  your abominations, O house of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_7" data-id="EK44_7">In your bringing in sons of a stranger, uncircumcised of  heart, and uncircumcised of flesh, to be in My sanctuary, to  pollute it, even My house, in your bringing near My bread, fat,  and blood, and they break My covenant by all your abominations,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_8" data-id="EK44_8">and ye have not kept the charge of My holy things, and ye  set [them] for keepers of My charge in My sanctuary for you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_9" data-id="EK44_9">`Thus said the Lord Jehovah: No son of a stranger,  uncircumcised of heart, and uncircumcised of flesh, cometh in  unto My sanctuary, even any son of a stranger, who [is] in the  midst of the sons of Israel,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_10" data-id="EK44_10">but -- the Levites who have gone far off from me, in the  wandering of Israel when they went astray from Me after their  idols, and they have borne their iniquity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_11" data-id="EK44_11">And they have been in My sanctuary ministrants, overseers  at the gates of the house, and ministrants at the house; they  slay the burnt-offering and the sacrifice for the people, and  they stand before them to serve them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_12" data-id="EK44_12">Because that they serve them before their idols, and have  been to the house of Israel for a stumbling-block of iniquity,  therefore I have lifted up my hand against them -- an  affirmation of the Lord Jehovah -- and they have borne their  iniquity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_13" data-id="EK44_13">And they draw not nigh unto Me to act as My priest, and to  draw nigh unto any of My holy things, unto the holy of holies,  and they have borne their shame and their abominations that  they have done,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_14" data-id="EK44_14">and I made them keepers of the charge of the house, for  all its service and for all that is done in it.</span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_18" data-id="EK44_18">Linen bonnets are on their head, and linen trousers are on  their loins, they are not restrained with sweat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_19" data-id="EK44_19">And in their going forth unto the outer court -- unto the  outer court unto the people -- they strip off their garments,  in which they are ministering, and have placed them in the holy  chambers, and have put on other garments; and they do not  sanctify the people in their own garments.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_20" data-id="EK44_20">And their head they do not shave, and the lock they do not  send forth; they certainly poll their heads.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_21" data-id="EK44_21">And no priest doth drink wine in their coming in unto the  inner court.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_22" data-id="EK44_22">And a widow and divorced woman they do not take to them  for wives: but -- virgins of the seed of the house of Israel,  and the widow who is widow of a priest, do they take.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_23" data-id="EK44_23">`And My people they direct between holy and common, and  between unclean and clean they cause them to discern.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_24" data-id="EK44_24">And concerning controversy, they stand up for judgment;  with My judgments they judge it; and My law and My statutes in  all My appointed places they keep; and My sabbaths they  sanctify.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_25" data-id="EK44_25">And unto any dead man they come not for uncleanness, but  for father, and for mother, and for son, and for daughter, for  brother, for sister who hath not been to a man, they defile  themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_26" data-id="EK44_26">`And after his cleansing, seven days they number to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_27" data-id="EK44_27">And in the day of his coming in unto the sanctuary, unto  the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he bringeth near  his sin-offering -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_28" data-id="EK44_28">And it hath been to them for an inheritance; I [am] their  inheritance: and a possession ye do not give to them in Israel;  I [am] their possession.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_29" data-id="EK44_29">The present, and the sin-offering, and the guilt-offering,  they do eat, and every devoted thing in Israel is theirs.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_30" data-id="EK44_30">And the first of all the first-fruits of all, and every  heave-offering of all, of all your heave-offerings, are the  priests': and the first of your dough ye give to the priest, to  cause a blessing to rest on thy house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_31" data-id="EK44_31">Any carcase and torn thing, of the fowl, and of the  beasts, the priests do not eat.</span>
