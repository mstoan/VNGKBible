<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN9_2" data-id="DN9_2">in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, have understood  by books the number of the years, (in that a word of Jehovah  hath been unto Jeremiah the prophet,) concerning the fulfilling  of the wastes of Jerusalem -- seventy years;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN9_3" data-id="DN9_3">and I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek [by] prayer and  supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN9_4" data-id="DN9_4">And I pray to Jehovah my God, and confess, and say: `I  beseech Thee, O Lord God, the great and the fearful, keeping  the covenant and the kindness to those loving Him, and to those  keeping His commands;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN9_5" data-id="DN9_5">we have sinned, and done perversely, and done wickedly, and  rebelled, to turn aside from Thy commands, and from Thy  judgments:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN9_6" data-id="DN9_6">and we have not hearkened unto Thy servants, the prophets,  who have spoken in Thy name unto our kings, our heads, and our  fathers, and to all the people of the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN9_7" data-id="DN9_7">`To Thee, O Lord, [is] the righteousness, and to us the  shame of face, as [at] this day, to the men of Judah, and to  the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, who are near,  and who are far off, in all the lands whither Thou hast driven  them, in their trespass that they have trespassed against Thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN9_8" data-id="DN9_8">`O Lord, to us [is] the shame of face, to our kings, to our  heads, and to our fathers, in that we have sinned against Thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN9_9" data-id="DN9_9">`To the Lord our God [are] the mercies and the  forgivenesses, for we have rebelled against Him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN9_10" data-id="DN9_10">and have not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah our God, to  walk in His laws, that He hath set before us by the hand of His  servants the prophets;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN9_11" data-id="DN9_11">and all Israel have transgressed Thy law, to turn aside so  as not to hearken to Thy voice; and poured on us is the  execration, and the oath, that is written in the law of Moses,  servant of God, because we have sinned against Him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN9_12" data-id="DN9_12">`And He confirmeth His words that He hath spoken against  us, and against our judges who have judged us, to bring in upon  us great evil, in that it hath not been done under the whole  heavens as it hath been done in Jerusalem,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN9_13" data-id="DN9_13">as it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil hath  come upon us, and we have not appeased the face of Jehovah our  God to turn back from our iniquities, and to act wisely in Thy  truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN9_14" data-id="DN9_14">And Jehovah doth watch for the evil, and bringeth it upon  us, for righteous [is] Jehovah our God concerning all His works  that He hath done, and we have not hearkened to His voice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN9_15" data-id="DN9_15">And now, O Lord our God, who hast brought forth Thy people  from the land of Egypt by a strong hand, and dost make for Thee  a name as at this day, we have sinned, we have done wickedly.</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN9_17" data-id="DN9_17">and now, hearken, O our God, unto the prayer of Thy  servant, and unto his supplication, and cause Thy face to shine  on Thy sanctuary that [is] desolate, for the Lord's sake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN9_18" data-id="DN9_18">`Incline, O my God, Thine ear, and hear, open Thine eyes  and see our desolations, and the city on which Thy name is  called; for not for our righteous acts are we causing our  supplications to fall before Thee, but for Thy mercies that  [are] many.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN9_19" data-id="DN9_19">O lord, hear, O Lord, forgive; O Lord, attend and do; do  not delay, for Thine own sake, O my God, for Thy name is called  on Thy city, and on Thy people.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN9_20" data-id="DN9_20">And while I am speaking, and praying, and confessing my  sin, and the sin of my people Israel, and causing my  supplication to fall before Jehovah my God, for the holy mount  of my God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN9_21" data-id="DN9_21">yea, while I am speaking in prayer, then that one Gabriel,  whom I had seen in vision at the commencement, being caused to  fly swiftly, is coming unto me at the time of the evening  present.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN9_22" data-id="DN9_22">And he giveth understanding, and speaketh with me, and  saith, `O Daniel, now I have come forth to cause thee to  consider understanding wisely;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN9_23" data-id="DN9_23">at the commencement of thy supplications hath the word come  forth, and I have come to declare [it], for thou [art] greatly  desired, and understand thou concerning the matter, and  consider concerning the appearance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN9_24" data-id="DN9_24">`Seventy weeks are determined for thy people, and for thy  holy city, to shut up the transgression, and to seal up sins,  and to cover iniquity, and to bring in righteousness  age-during, and to seal up vision and prophet, and to anoint  the holy of holies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN9_25" data-id="DN9_25">And thou dost know, and dost consider wisely, from the  going forth of the word to restore and to build Jerusalem till  Messiah the Leader [is] seven weeks, and sixty and two weeks:  the broad place hath been built again, and the rampart, even in  the distress of the times.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN9_26" data-id="DN9_26">And after the sixty and two weeks, cut off is Messiah, and  the city and the holy place are not his, the Leader who hath  come doth destroy the people; and its end [is] with a flood,  and till the end [is] war, determined [are] desolations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN9_27" data-id="DN9_27">And he hath strengthened a covenant with many -- one week,  and [in] the midst of the week he causeth sacrifice and present  to cease, and by the wing of abominations he is making  desolate, even till the consummation, and that which is  determined is poured on the desolate one.'</span>
