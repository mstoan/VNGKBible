<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_2" data-id="RT1_2">And the name of the man [is] Elimelech, and the name of his  wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion,  Ephrathites from Beth-Lehem-Judah; and they come into the  fields of Moab, and are there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_3" data-id="RT1_3">And Elimelech husband of Naomi dieth, and she is left, she  and her two sons;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_4" data-id="RT1_4">and they take to them wives, Moabitesses: the name of the  one [is] Orpah, and the name of the second Ruth; and they dwell  there about ten years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_5" data-id="RT1_5">And they die also, both of them -- Mahlon and Chilion -- and the  woman is left of her two children and of her husband.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_6" data-id="RT1_6">And she riseth, she and her daughters-in-law, and turneth  back from the fields of Moab, for she hath heard in the fields  of Moab that God hath looked after His people, -- to give to them  bread.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_7" data-id="RT1_7">And she goeth out from the place where she hath been, and  her two daughters-in-law with her, and they go in the way to  turn back unto the land of Judah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_8" data-id="RT1_8">And Naomi saith to her two daughters-in-law, `Go, turn back,  each to the house of her mother; Jehovah doth with you kindness  as ye have done with the dead, and with me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_9" data-id="RT1_9">Jehovah doth grant to you, and find ye rest each in the  house of her husband;' and she kisseth them, and they lift up  their voice and weep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_10" data-id="RT1_10">And they say to her, `Surely with thee we go back to thy  people.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_11" data-id="RT1_11">And Naomi saith, `Turn back, my daughters; why do ye go  with me? are there yet to me sons in my bowels that they have  been to you for husbands?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_12" data-id="RT1_12">Turn back, my daughters, go, for I am too aged to be to a  husband; though I had said, There is for me hope, also, I have  been to-night to a husband, and also I have borne sons:</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_13" data-id="RT1_13">for them do ye wait till that they grow up? for them do ye  shut yourselves up, not to be to a husband? nay, my daughters,  for more bitter to me than to you, for the hand of Jehovah hath  gone out against me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_14" data-id="RT1_14">And they lift up their voice, and weep again, and Orpah  kisseth her mother-in-law, and Ruth hath cleaved to her.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_16" data-id="RT1_16">And Ruth saith, `Urge me not to leave thee -- to turn back  from after thee; for whither thou goest I go, and where thou  lodgest I lodge; thy people [is] my people, and thy God my God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_17" data-id="RT1_17">Where thou diest I die, and there I am buried; thus doth  Jehovah to me, and thus doth He add -- for death itself doth part  between me and thee.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_18" data-id="RT1_18">And she seeth that she is strengthening herself to go with  her, and she ceaseth to speak unto her;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_19" data-id="RT1_19">and they go both of them till their coming in to Beth-Lehem;  and it cometh to pass at their coming in to Beth-Lehem, that  all the city is moved at them, and they say, `Is this Naomi?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_20" data-id="RT1_20">And she saith unto them, `Call me not Naomi; call me Mara,  for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly to me,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_21" data-id="RT1_21">I went out full, and empty hath Jehovah brought me back,  why do ye call me Naomi, and Jehovah hath testified against me,  and the Almighty hath done evil to me?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_22" data-id="RT1_22">And Naomi turneth back, and Ruth the Moabitess her  daughter-in-law with her, who hath turned back from the fields  of Moab, and they have come in to Beth-Lehem at the  commencement of barley-harvest.</span>
