<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_2" data-id="JN10_2">and he who is entering through the door is shepherd of the  sheep;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_3" data-id="JN10_3">to this one the doorkeeper doth open, and the sheep hear  his voice, and his own sheep he doth call by name, and doth  lead them forth;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_4" data-id="JN10_4">and when his own sheep he may put forth, before them he  goeth on, and the sheep follow him, because they have known  his voice;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_5" data-id="JN10_5">and a stranger they will not follow, but will flee from  him, because they have not known the voice of strangers.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_6" data-id="JN10_6">This similitude spake Jesus to them, and they knew not what  the things were that he was speaking to them;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_7" data-id="JN10_7">Jesus said therefore again to them, `Verily, verily, I say  to you -- I am the door of the sheep;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_8" data-id="JN10_8">all, as many as came before me, are thieves and robbers,  but the sheep did not hear them;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_9" data-id="JN10_9">I am the door, through me if any one may come in, he shall  be saved, and he shall come in, and go out, and find pasture.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_10" data-id="JN10_10">`The thief doth not come, except that he may steal, and  kill, and destroy; I came that they may have life, and may have  [it] abundantly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_11" data-id="JN10_11">`I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd his life layeth  down for the sheep;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_12" data-id="JN10_12">and the hireling, and not being a shepherd, whose own the  sheep are not, doth behold the wolf coming, and doth leave the  sheep, and doth flee; and the wolf catcheth them, and  scattereth the sheep;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_13" data-id="JN10_13">and the hireling doth flee because he is an hireling, and  is not caring for the sheep.</span>

<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_19" data-id="JN10_19">Therefore, again, there came a division among the Jews,  because of these words,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_20" data-id="JN10_20">and many of them said, `He hath a demon, and is mad, why  do ye hear him?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_21" data-id="JN10_21">others said, `These sayings are not those of a demoniac;  is a demon able blind men's eyes to open?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_22" data-id="JN10_22">And the dedication in Jerusalem came, and it was winter,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_23" data-id="JN10_23">and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the porch of  Solomon,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_24" data-id="JN10_24">the Jews, therefore, came round about him, and said to  him, `Till when our soul dost thou hold in suspense? if thou  art the Christ, tell us freely.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_25" data-id="JN10_25">Jesus answered them, `I told you, and ye do not believe;  the works that I do in the name of my Father, these testify  concerning me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_26" data-id="JN10_26">but ye do not believe, for ye are not of my sheep,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_27" data-id="JN10_27">according as I said to you: My sheep my voice do hear, and  I know them, and they follow me,</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_28" data-id="JN10_28">and life age-during I give to them, and they shall not  perish -- to the age, and no one shall pluck them out of my  hand;</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_29" data-id="JN10_29">my Father, who hath given to me, is greater than all, and  no one is able to pluck out of the hand of my Father;</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_30" data-id="JN10_30">I and the Father are one.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_31" data-id="JN10_31">Therefore, again, did the Jews take up stones that they  may stone him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_32" data-id="JN10_32">Jesus answered them, `Many good works did I shew you from  my Father; because of which work of them do ye stone me?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_33" data-id="JN10_33">The Jews answered him, saying, `For a good work we do not  stone thee, but for evil speaking, and because thou, being a  man, dost make thyself God.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_34" data-id="JN10_34">Jesus answered them, `Is it not having been written in  your law: I said, ye are gods?</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_35" data-id="JN10_35">if them he did call gods unto whom the word of God came,  (and the Writing is not able to be broken,)</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_36" data-id="JN10_36">of him whom the Father did sanctify, and send to the  world, do ye say -- Thou speakest evil, because I said, Son of  God I am?</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_37" data-id="JN10_37">if I do not the works of my Father, do not believe me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_38" data-id="JN10_38">and if I do, even if me ye may not believe, the works  believe, that ye may know and may believe that in me [is] the  Father, and I in Him.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_39" data-id="JN10_39">Therefore were they seeking again to seize him, and he  went forth out of their hand,</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_40" data-id="JN10_40">and went away again to the other side of the Jordan, to  the place where John was at first baptizing, and remained  there,</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_41" data-id="JN10_41">and many came unto him, and said -- `John, indeed, did no  sign, and all things, as many as John said about this one were  true;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN10_42" data-id="JN10_42">and many did believe in him there.</span>
