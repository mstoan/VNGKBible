<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC3_2" data-id="MC3_2">Ye who are hating good, and loving evil, Taking violently  their skin from off them, And their flesh from off their bones,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC3_3" data-id="MC3_3">And who have eaten the flesh of My people, And their skin  from off them have stript, And their bones they have broken,  And they have spread [them] out as in a pot, And as flesh in  the midst of a caldron.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC3_4" data-id="MC3_4">Then do they cry unto Jehovah, And He doth not answer them,  And hideth His face from them at that time, As they have made  evil their doings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC3_5" data-id="MC3_5">Thus said Jehovah concerning the prophets Who are causing My  people to err, Who are biting with their teeth, And have cried  `Peace,' And he who doth not give unto their mouth, They have  sanctified against him war.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC3_6" data-id="MC3_6">Therefore a night ye have without vision, And darkness ye  have without divination, And gone in hath the sun on the  prophets, And black over them hath been the day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC3_7" data-id="MC3_7">And ashamed have been the seers, And confounded have been  the diviners, And covered their lip have all of them, For their  is no answer, O God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC3_8" data-id="MC3_8">And yet I have been full of power by the Spirit of Jehovah,  And of judgment, and of might, To declare to Jacob his  transgression, And to Israel his sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC3_9" data-id="MC3_9">Hear this, I pray you, heads of the house of Jacob, And ye  judges of the house of Israel, Who are making judgment  abominable, And all uprightness do pervert.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC3_10" data-id="MC3_10">Building up Zion with blood, And Jerusalem with iniquity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC3_11" data-id="MC3_11">Her heads for a bribe do judge, And her priests for hire do  teach, And her prophets for silver divine, And on Jehovah they  lean, saying, `Is not Jehovah in our midst? Evil doth not come  in upon us.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC3_12" data-id="MC3_12">Therefore, for your sake, Zion is ploughed a field, and  Jerusalem is heaps, And the mount of the house [is] for high  places of a forest!</span>
