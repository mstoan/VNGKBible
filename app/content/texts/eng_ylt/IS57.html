<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS57_9" data-id="IS57_9">And goest joyfully to the king in ointment, And dost  multiply thy perfumes, And sendest thine ambassadors afar off,  And humblest thyself unto Sheol.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS57_10" data-id="IS57_10">In the greatness of thy way thou hast laboured, Thou hast  not said, `It is desperate.' The life of thy hand thou hast  found, Therefore thou hast not been sick.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS57_11" data-id="IS57_11">And of whom hast thou been afraid, and fearest, That thou  liest, and Me hast not remembered? Thou hast not laid [it] to  thy heart, Am not I silent, even from of old? And Me thou  fearest not?</span>
