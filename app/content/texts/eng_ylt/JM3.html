<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_2" data-id="JM3_2">for we all make many stumbles; if any one in word doth not  stumble, this one [is] a perfect man, able to bridle also the  whole body;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_3" data-id="JM3_3">lo, the bits we put into the mouths of the horses for their  obeying us, and their whole body we turn about;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_4" data-id="JM3_4">lo, also the ships, being so great, and by fierce winds  being driven, are led about by a very small helm,  whithersoever the impulse of the helmsman doth counsel,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_5" data-id="JM3_5">so also the tongue is a little member, and doth boast  greatly; lo, a little fire how much wood it doth kindle!</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_6" data-id="JM3_6">and the tongue [is] a fire, the world of the  unrighteousness, so the tongue is set in our members, which is  spotting our whole body, and is setting on fire the course of  nature, and is set on fire by the gehenna.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_7" data-id="JM3_7">For every nature, both of beasts and of fowls, both of  creeping things and things of the sea, is subdued, and hath  been subdued, by the human nature,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_8" data-id="JM3_8">and the tongue no one of men is able to subdue, [it is] an  unruly evil, full of deadly poison,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_9" data-id="JM3_9">with it we do bless the God and Father, and with it we do  curse the men made according to the similitude of God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_10" data-id="JM3_10">out of the same mouth doth come forth blessing and cursing;  it doth not need, my brethren, these things so to happen;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_11" data-id="JM3_11">doth the fountain out of the same opening pour forth the  sweet and the bitter?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_12" data-id="JM3_12">is a fig-tree able, my brethren, olives to make? or a vine  figs? so no fountain salt and sweet water [is able] to make.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_13" data-id="JM3_13">Who [is] wise and intelligent among you? let him shew out  of the good behaviour his works in meekness of wisdom,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_14" data-id="JM3_14">and if bitter zeal ye have, and rivalry in your heart,  glory not, nor lie against the truth;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_15" data-id="JM3_15">this wisdom is not descending from above, but earthly,  physical, demon-like,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_16" data-id="JM3_16">for where zeal and rivalry [are], there is insurrection and  every evil matter;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_17" data-id="JM3_17">and the wisdom from above, first, indeed, is pure, then  peaceable, gentle, easily entreated, full of kindness and good  fruits, uncontentious, and unhypocritical: --</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_18" data-id="JM3_18">and the fruit of the righteousness in peace is sown to  those making peace.</span>
