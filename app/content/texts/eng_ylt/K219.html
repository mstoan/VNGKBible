<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_26" data-id="K219_26">And their inhabitants [are] feeble-handed, They were  broken down, and are dried up, They have been the herb of the  field, And the greenness of the tender grass, Grass of the  roofs, And blasted corn -- before it hath risen up!</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_27" data-id="K219_27">And thy sitting down, and thy going out, And thy coming  in, I have known, And thine anger towards Me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_28" data-id="K219_28">Because of thine anger towards Me, And thy noise -- it  came up into Mine ears, I have put My hook in thy nose, And My  bridle in thy lips, And have caused thee to turn back, In the  way in which thou camest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_29" data-id="K219_29">And this to thee [is] the sign, Food of the year [is] the  spontaneous growth, And in the second year the self-produced,  And in the third year sow ye, and reap, And plant vineyards,  and eat their fruits.</span>

<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_31" data-id="K219_31">For from Jerusalem goeth out a remnant, And an escape from  mount Zion; The zeal of Jehovah [of Hosts] doth this.</span>

<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v K219_37" data-id="K219_37">and it cometh to pass, he is bowing himself in the house  of Nisroch his god, and Adramelech and Sharezar [his sons] have  smitten him with the sword, and they have escaped to the land  of Ararat, and Esar-Haddon his son reigneth in his stead.</span>
