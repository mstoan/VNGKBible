<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_2" data-id="JG6_2">and the hand of Midian is strong against Israel, from the  presence of Midian have the sons of Israel made for themselves  the flowings which [are] in the mountains, and the caves, and  the strongholds.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_3" data-id="JG6_3">And it hath been, if Israel hath sowed, that Midian hath  come up, and Amalek, and the sons of the east, yea, they have  come up against him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_4" data-id="JG6_4">and encamp against them, and destroy the increase of the  land till thine entering Gaza; and they leave no sustenance in  Israel, either sheep, or ox, or ass;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_5" data-id="JG6_5">for they and their cattle come up, with their tents; they  come in as the fulness of the locust for multitude, and of them  and of their cattle there is no number, and they come into the  land to destroy it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_6" data-id="JG6_6">And Israel is very weak from the presence of Midian, and the  sons of Israel cry unto Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_7" data-id="JG6_7">And it cometh to pass when the sons of Israel have cried  unto Jehovah, concerning Midian,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_8" data-id="JG6_8">that Jehovah sendeth a man, a prophet, unto the sons of  Israel, and he saith to them, `Thus said Jehovah, God of  Israel, I -- I have brought you up out of Egypt, and I bring you  out from a house of servants,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_9" data-id="JG6_9">and I deliver you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out  of the hand of all your oppressors, and I cast them out from  your presence, and I give to you their land,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_10" data-id="JG6_10">and I say to you, I [am] Jehovah your God, ye do not fear  the gods of the Amorite in whose land ye are dwelling: -- and ye  have not hearkened to My voice.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_11" data-id="JG6_11">And the messenger of Jehovah cometh and sitteth under the  oak which [is] in Ophrah, which [is] to Joash the Abi-Ezrite,  and Gideon his son is beating out wheat in the wine-press, to  remove [it] from the presence of the Midianites;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_12" data-id="JG6_12">and the messenger of Jehovah appeareth unto him, and saith  unto him, `Jehovah [is] with thee, O mighty one of valour.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_14" data-id="JG6_14">And Jehovah turneth unto him and saith, `Go in this -- thy  power; and thou hast saved Israel out of the hand of  Midian -- have not I sent thee.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_15" data-id="JG6_15">And he saith unto him, `O, my lord, wherewith do I save  Israel? lo, my chief [is] weak in Manasseh, and I the least in  the house of my father.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_16" data-id="JG6_16">And Jehovah saith unto him, `Because I am with thee -- thou  hast smitten the Midianites as one man.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_17" data-id="JG6_17">And he saith unto Him, `If, I pray Thee, I have found grace  in Thine eyes, then Thou hast done for me a sign that Thou art  speaking with me.</span>

<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_19" data-id="JG6_19">And Gideon hath gone in, and prepareth a kid of the goats,  and of an ephah of flour unleavened things; the flesh he hath  put in a basket, and the broth he hath put in a pot, and he  bringeth out unto Him, unto the place of the oak, and bringeth  [it] nigh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_20" data-id="JG6_20">And the messenger of God saith unto him, `Take the flesh  and the unleavened things, and place on this rock -- and the  broth pour out;' and he doth so.</span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_22" data-id="JG6_22">And Gideon seeth that He [is] a messenger of Jehovah, and  Gideon saith, `Alas, Lord Jehovah! because that I have seen a  messenger of Jehovah face to face!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_23" data-id="JG6_23">And Jehovah saith to him, `Peace to thee; fear not; thou  dost not die.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_24" data-id="JG6_24">And Gideon buildeth there an altar to Jehovah, and calleth  it Jehovah-Shalom, unto this day it [is] yet in Ophrah of the  Abi-Ezrites.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_25" data-id="JG6_25">And it cometh to pass, on that night, that Jehovah saith to  him, `Take the young ox which [is] to thy father, and the  second bullock of seven years, and thou hast thrown down the  altar of Baal which [is] to thy father, and the shrine which  [is] by it thou dost cut down,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_26" data-id="JG6_26">and thou hast built an altar to Jehovah thy God on the top  of this stronghold, by the arrangement, and hast taken the  second bullock, and caused to ascend a burnt-offering with the  wood of the shrine which thou cuttest down.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_27" data-id="JG6_27">And Gideon taketh ten men of his servants, and doth as  Jehovah hath spoken unto him, and it cometh to pass, because he  hath been afraid of the house of his father, and the men of the  city, to do [it] by day, that he doth [it] by night.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_28" data-id="JG6_28">And the men of the city rise early in the morning, and lo,  broken down hath been the altar of Baal, and the shrine which  is by it hath been cut down, and the second bullock hath been  offered on the altar which is built.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_29" data-id="JG6_29">And they say one to another, `Who hath done this thing?'  and they inquire and seek, and they say, `Gideon son of Joash  hath done this thing.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_30" data-id="JG6_30">And the men of the city say unto Joash, `Bring out thy son,  and he dieth, because he hath broken down the altar of Baal,  and because he hath cut down the shrine which [is] by it.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_31" data-id="JG6_31">And Joash saith to all who have stood against him, `Ye, do  ye plead for Baal? ye -- do ye save him? he who pleadeth for him  is put to death during the morning; if he [is] a god he himself  doth plead against him, because he hath broken down his altar.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_32" data-id="JG6_32">And he calleth him, on that day, Jerubbaal, saying, `The  Baal doth plead against him, because he hath broken down his  altar.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_33" data-id="JG6_33">And all Midian and Amalek and the sons of the east have  been gathered together, and pass over, and encamp in the valley  of Jezreel,</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_34" data-id="JG6_34">and the Spirit of Jehovah hath clothed Gideon, and he  bloweth with a trumpet, and Abi-Ezer is called after him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_35" data-id="JG6_35">and messengers he hath sent into all Manasseh, and it also  is called after him; and messengers he hath sent into Asher,  and into Zebulun, and into Naphtali, and they come up to meet  them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_36" data-id="JG6_36">And Gideon saith unto God, `If Thou art Saviour of Israel  by my hand, as Thou hast spoken,</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_37" data-id="JG6_37">lo, I am placing the fleece of wool in the threshing-floor:  if dew is on the fleece alone, and on all the earth  drought -- then I have known that Thou dost save Israel by my  hand, as Thou hast spoken;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_38" data-id="JG6_38">and it is so, and he riseth early on the morrow, and  presseth the fleece, and wringeth dew out of the fleece -- the  fulness of the bowl, of water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_39" data-id="JG6_39">And Gideon saith unto God, `Let not Thine anger burn  against me, and I speak only this time; let me try, I pray  Thee, only this time with the fleece -- let there be, I pray  Thee, drought on the fleece alone, and on all the earth let  there be dew.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG6_40" data-id="JG6_40">And God doth so on that night, and there is drought on the  fleece alone, and on all the earth there hath been dew.</span>
