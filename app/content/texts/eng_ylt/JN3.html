<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN3_3" data-id="JN3_3">Jesus answered and said to him, `Verily, verily, I say to  thee, If any one may not be born from above, he is not able to  see the reign of God;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN3_4" data-id="JN3_4">Nicodemus saith unto him, `How is a man able to be born,  being old? is he able into the womb of his mother a second  time to enter, and to be born?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN3_5" data-id="JN3_5">Jesus answered, `Verily, verily, I say to thee, If any one  may not be born of water, and the Spirit, he is not able to  enter into the reign of God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN3_6" data-id="JN3_6">that which hath been born of the flesh is flesh, and that  which hath been born of the Spirit is spirit.</span>
