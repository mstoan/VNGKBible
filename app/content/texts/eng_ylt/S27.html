<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_2" data-id="S27_2">that the king saith unto Nathan the prophet, `See, I pray  thee, I am dwelling in a house of cedars, and the ark of God is  dwelling in the midst of the curtain.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_3" data-id="S27_3">And Nathan saith unto the king, `All that [is] in thine  heart -- go, do, for Jehovah [is] with thee.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_4" data-id="S27_4">And it cometh to pass in that night, that the word of  Jehovah is unto Nathan, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_5" data-id="S27_5">`Go, and thou hast said unto My servant, unto David, Thus  said Jehovah, Dost thou build for Me a house for My dwelling  in?</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_7" data-id="S27_7">During all [the time] that I have walked up and down among  all the sons of Israel, a word have I spoken with one of the  tribes of Israel which I commanded to feed my people Israel,  saying, `Why have ye not built to Me a house of cedars?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_8" data-id="S27_8">and now, thus dost thou say to My servant, to David: `Thus  said Jehovah of Hosts, I have taken thee from the comely place,  from after the flock, to be leader over My people, over Israel;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_9" data-id="S27_9">and I am with thee whithersoever thou hast gone, and I cut  off all thine enemies from thy presence, and have made for thee  a great name, as the name of the great ones who [are] in the  earth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_10" data-id="S27_10">and I have appointed a place for My people, for Israel, and  have planted it, and it hath tabernacled in its place, and it  is not troubled any more, and the sons of perverseness do not  add to afflict it any more, as in the beginning,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_11" data-id="S27_11">even from the day that I appointed judges over My people  Israel; and I have given rest to thee from all thine enemies,  and Jehovah hath declared to thee that Jehovah doth make for  thee a house.</span>
