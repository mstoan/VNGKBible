<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_2" data-id="JN9_2">and his disciples asked him, saying, `Rabbi, who did sin,  this one or his parents, that he should be born blind?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_3" data-id="JN9_3">Jesus answered, `Neither did this one sin nor his parents,  but that the works of God may be manifested in him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_4" data-id="JN9_4">it behoveth me to be working the works of Him who sent me  while it is day; night doth come, when no one is able to work:  --</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_5" data-id="JN9_5">when I am in the world, I am a light of the world.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_6" data-id="JN9_6">These things saying, he spat on the ground, and made clay of  the spittle, and rubbed the clay on the eyes of the blind man,  and said to him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_7" data-id="JN9_7">`Go away, wash at the pool of Siloam,' which is,  interpreted, Sent. He went away, therefore, and did wash, and  came seeing;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_8" data-id="JN9_8">the neighbours, therefore, and those seeing him before, that  he was blind, said, `Is not this he who is sitting and  begging?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_9" data-id="JN9_9">others said -- `This is he;' and others -- `He is like to  him;' he himself said, -- `I am [he].'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_10" data-id="JN9_10">They said, therefore, to him, `How were thine eyes opened?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_11" data-id="JN9_11">he answered and said, `A man called Jesus made clay, and  rubbed my eyes, and said to me, Go away to the pool of Siloam,  and wash; and having gone away and having washed, I received  sight;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_12" data-id="JN9_12">they said, therefore, to him, `Where is that one?' he  saith, `I have not known.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_13" data-id="JN9_13">They bring him to the Pharisees who once [was] blind,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_14" data-id="JN9_14">and it was a sabbath when Jesus made the clay, and opened  his eyes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_15" data-id="JN9_15">Again, therefore, the Pharisees also were asking him how he  received sight, and he said to them, `Clay he did put upon my  eyes, and I did wash -- and I see.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_16" data-id="JN9_16">Of the Pharisees, therefore, certain said, `This man is not  from God, because the sabbath he doth not keep;' others said,  `How is a man -- a sinful one -- able to do such signs?' and  there was a division among them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_17" data-id="JN9_17">They said to the blind man again, `Thou -- what dost thou  say of him -- that he opened thine eyes?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_18" data-id="JN9_18">and he said -- `He is a prophet.' The Jews, therefore, did  not believe concerning him that he was blind and did receive  sight, till that they called the parents of him who received  sight,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_19" data-id="JN9_19">and they asked them, saying, `Is your son, of whom ye say  that he was born blind? how then now doth he see?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_20" data-id="JN9_20">His parents answered them and said, `We have known that  this is our son, and that he was born blind;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_21" data-id="JN9_21">and how he now seeth, we have not known; or who opened his  eyes, we have not known; himself is of age, ask him; he  himself shall speak concerning himself.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_22" data-id="JN9_22">These things said his parents, because they were afraid of  the Jews, for already had the Jews agreed together, that if  any one may confess him -- Christ, he may be put out of the  synagogue;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_23" data-id="JN9_23">because of this his parents said -- `He is of age, ask  him.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_24" data-id="JN9_24">They called, therefore, a second time the man who was  blind, and they said to him, `Give glory to God, we have known  that this man is a sinner;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_25" data-id="JN9_25">he answered, therefore, and said, `If he be a sinner -- I  have not known, one thing I have known, that, being blind, now  I see.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_26" data-id="JN9_26">And they said to him again, `What did he to thee? how did  he open thine eyes?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_27" data-id="JN9_27">He answered them, `I told you already, and ye did not hear;  why again do ye wish to hear? do ye also wish to become his  disciples?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_28" data-id="JN9_28">They reviled him, therefore, and said, `Thou art his  disciple, and we are Moses' disciples;</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_29" data-id="JN9_29">we have known that God hath spoken to Moses, but this one  -- we have not known whence he is.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_30" data-id="JN9_30">The man answered and said to them, `Why, in this is a  wonderful thing, that ye have not known whence he is, and he  opened my eyes!</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_31" data-id="JN9_31">and we have known that God doth not hear sinners, but, if  any one may be a worshipper of God, and may do His will, him  He doth hear;</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_32" data-id="JN9_32">from the age it was not heard, that any one did open eyes  of one who hath been born blind;</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_33" data-id="JN9_33">if this one were not from God, he were not able to do  anything.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_34" data-id="JN9_34">They answered and said to him, `In sins thou wast born  altogether, and thou dost teach us!' and they cast him forth  without.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_35" data-id="JN9_35">Jesus heard that they cast him forth without, and having  found him, he said to him, `Dost thou believe in the Son of  God?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_36" data-id="JN9_36">he answered and said, `Who is he, sir, that I may believe  in him?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_37" data-id="JN9_37">And Jesus said to him, `Thou hast both seen him, and he who  is speaking with thee is he;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_38" data-id="JN9_38">and he said, `I believe, sir,' and bowed before him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_39" data-id="JN9_39">And Jesus said, `For judgment I to this world did come,  that those not seeing may see, and those seeing may become  blind.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_40" data-id="JN9_40">And those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these  things, and they said to him, `Are we also blind?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_41" data-id="JN9_41">Jesus said to them, `If ye were blind, ye were not having  had sin, but now ye say -- We see, therefore doth your sin  remain.</span>
