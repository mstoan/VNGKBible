<div class="c">20</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV20_1" data-id="RV20_1">And I saw a messenger coming down out of the heaven, having  the key of the abyss, and a great chain over his hand,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV20_2" data-id="RV20_2">and he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, who is  Devil and Adversary, and did bind him a thousand years,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV20_3" data-id="RV20_3">and he cast him to the abyss, and did shut him up, and put  a seal upon him, that he may not lead astray the nations any  more, till the thousand years may be finished; and after these  it behoveth him to be loosed a little time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV20_4" data-id="RV20_4">And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was  given to them, and the souls of those who have been beheaded  because of the testimony of Jesus, and because of the word of  God, and who did not bow before the beast, nor his image, and  did not receive the mark upon their forehead and upon their  hand, and they did live and reign with Christ the thousand  years;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV20_5" data-id="RV20_5">and the rest of the dead did not live again till the  thousand years may be finished; this [is] the first rising  again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV20_6" data-id="RV20_6">Happy and holy [is] he who is having part in the first  rising again; over these the second death hath not authority,  but they shall be priests of God and of the Christ, and shall  reign with him a thousand years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV20_7" data-id="RV20_7">And when the thousand years may be finished, the Adversary  shall be loosed out of his prison,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV20_8" data-id="RV20_8">and he shall go forth to lead the nations astray, that are  in the four corners of the earth -- Gog and Magog -- to gather  them together to war, of whom the number [is] as the sand of  the sea;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV20_9" data-id="RV20_9">and they did go up over the breadth of the land, and did  surround the camp of the saints, and the beloved city, and  there came down fire from God out of the heaven, and devoured  them;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV20_10" data-id="RV20_10">and the Devil, who is leading them astray, was cast into  the lake of fire and brimstone, where [are] the beast and the  false prophet, and they shall be tormented day and night -- to  the ages of the ages.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV20_11" data-id="RV20_11">And I saw a great white throne, and Him who is sitting  upon it, from whose face the earth and the heaven did flee  away, and place was not found for them;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV20_12" data-id="RV20_12">and I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God,  and scrolls were opened, and another scroll was opened, which  is that of the life, and the dead were judged out of the things  written in the scrolls -- according to their works;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV20_13" data-id="RV20_13">and the sea did give up those dead in it, and the death  and the hades did give up the dead in them, and they were  judged, each one according to their works;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV20_14" data-id="RV20_14">and the death and the hades were cast to the lake of the  fire -- this [is] the second death;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV20_15" data-id="RV20_15">and if any one was not found written in the scroll of the  life, he was cast to the lake of the fire.</span>
