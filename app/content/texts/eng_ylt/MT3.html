<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT3_2" data-id="MT3_2">and saying, `Reform, for come nigh hath the reign of the  heavens,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT3_3" data-id="MT3_3">for this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet,  saying, `A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye  the way of the Lord, straight make ye His paths.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT3_4" data-id="MT3_4">And this John had his clothing of camel's hair, and a girdle  of skin round his loins, and his nourishment was locusts and  honey of the field.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT3_5" data-id="MT3_5">Then were going forth unto him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and  all the region round about the Jordan,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT3_6" data-id="MT3_6">and they were baptized in the Jordan by him, confessing  their sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT3_7" data-id="MT3_7">And having seen many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming  about his baptism, he said to them, `Brood of vipers! who did  shew you to flee from the coming wrath?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT3_8" data-id="MT3_8">bear, therefore, fruits worthy of the reformation,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT3_9" data-id="MT3_9">and do not think to say in yourselves, A father we have --  Abraham, for I say to you, that God is able out of these stones  to raise children to Abraham,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT3_10" data-id="MT3_10">and now also, the axe unto the root of the trees is laid,  every tree therefore not bearing good fruit is hewn down, and  to fire is cast.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT3_11" data-id="MT3_11">`I indeed do baptize you with water to reformation, but he  who after me is coming is mightier than I, of whom I am not  worthy to bear the sandals, he shall baptize you with the Holy  Spirit and with fire,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT3_12" data-id="MT3_12">whose fan [is] in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse  his floor, and will gather his wheat to the storehouse, but the  chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT3_13" data-id="MT3_13">Then cometh Jesus from Galilee upon the Jordan, unto John  to be baptized by him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT3_14" data-id="MT3_14">but John was forbidding him, saying, `I have need by thee  to be baptized -- and thou dost come unto me!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT3_15" data-id="MT3_15">But Jesus answering said to him, `Suffer now, for thus it  is becoming to us to fulfill all righteousness,' then he doth  suffer him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT3_16" data-id="MT3_16">And having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from  the water, and lo, opened to him were the heavens, and he saw  the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT3_17" data-id="MT3_17">and lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying, `This is My Son  -- the Beloved, in whom I did delight.'</span>
