<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_2" data-id="MT8_2">and lo, a leper having come, was bowing to him, saying,  `Sir, if thou art willing, thou art able to cleanse me;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_3" data-id="MT8_3">and having stretched forth the hand, Jesus touched him,  saying, `I will, be thou cleansed,' and immediately his leprosy  was cleansed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_4" data-id="MT8_4">And Jesus saith to him, `See, thou mayest tell no one, but  go, thyself shew to the priest, and bring the gift that Moses  commanded for a testimony to them.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_5" data-id="MT8_5">And Jesus having entered into Capernaum, there came to him a  centurion calling upon him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_6" data-id="MT8_6">and saying, `Sir, my young man hath been laid in the house a  paralytic, fearfully afflicted,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_7" data-id="MT8_7">and Jesus saith to him, `I, having come, will heal him.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_8" data-id="MT8_8">And the centurion answering said, `Sir, I am not worthy that  thou mayest enter under my roof, but only say a word, and my  servant shall be healed;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_9" data-id="MT8_9">for I also am a man under authority, having under myself  soldiers, and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth, and to  another, Be coming, and he cometh, and to my servant, Do this,  and he doth [it].'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_10" data-id="MT8_10">And Jesus having heard, did wonder, and said to those  following, `Verily I say to you, not even in Israel so great  faith have I found;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_11" data-id="MT8_11">and I say to you, that many from east and west shall come  and recline (at meat) with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in  the reign of the heavens,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_12" data-id="MT8_12">but the sons of the reign shall be cast forth to the outer  darkness -- there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the  teeth.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_13" data-id="MT8_13">And Jesus said to the centurion, `Go, and as thou didst  believe let it be to thee;' and his young man was healed in  that hour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_14" data-id="MT8_14">And Jesus having come into the house of Peter, saw his  mother-in-law laid, and fevered,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_15" data-id="MT8_15">and he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she  arose, and was ministering to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_16" data-id="MT8_16">And evening having come, they brought to him many  demoniacs, and he did cast out the spirits with a word, and did  heal all who were ill,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_17" data-id="MT8_17">that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah  the prophet, saying, `Himself took our infirmities, and the  sicknesses he did bear.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_18" data-id="MT8_18">And Jesus having seen great multitudes about him, did  command to depart to the other side;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_19" data-id="MT8_19">and a certain scribe having come, said to him, `Teacher, I  will follow thee wherever thou mayest go;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_20" data-id="MT8_20">and Jesus saith to him, `The foxes have holes, and the  birds of the heaven places of rest, but the Son of Man hath not  where he may lay the head.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_21" data-id="MT8_21">And another of his disciples said to him, `Sir, permit me  first to depart and to bury my father;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_22" data-id="MT8_22">and Jesus said to him, `Follow me, and suffer the dead to  bury their own dead.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_23" data-id="MT8_23">And when he entered into the boat his disciples did follow  him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_24" data-id="MT8_24">and lo, a great tempest arose in the sea, so that the boat  was being covered by the waves, but he was sleeping,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_25" data-id="MT8_25">and his disciples having come to him, awoke him, saying,  `Sir, save us; we are perishing.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_26" data-id="MT8_26">And he saith to them, `Why are ye fearful, O ye of little  faith?' Then having risen, he rebuked the winds and the sea,  and there was a great calm;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_27" data-id="MT8_27">and the men wondered, saying, `What kind -- is this, that  even the wind and the sea do obey him?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_28" data-id="MT8_28">And he having come to the other side, to the region of the  Gergesenes, there met him two demoniacs, coming forth out of  the tombs, very fierce, so that no one was able to pass over by  that way,</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_29" data-id="MT8_29">and lo, they cried out, saying, `What -- to us and to thee,  Jesus, Son of God? didst thou come hither, before the time, to  afflict us?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_30" data-id="MT8_30">And there was far off from them a herd of many swine  feeding,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_31" data-id="MT8_31">and the demons were calling on him, saying, `If thou dost  cast us forth, permit us to go away to the herd of the swine;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_32" data-id="MT8_32">and he saith to them, `Go.' And having come forth, they  went to the herd of the swine, and lo, the whole herd of the  swine rushed down the steep, to the sea, and died in the  waters,</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_33" data-id="MT8_33">and those feeding did flee, and, having gone to the city,  they declared all, and the matter of the demoniacs.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT8_34" data-id="MT8_34">And lo, all the city came forth to meet Jesus, and having  seen him, they called on [him] that he might depart from their  borders.</span>
