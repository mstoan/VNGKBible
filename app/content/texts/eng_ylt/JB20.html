<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB20_3" data-id="JB20_3">The chastisement of my shame I hear, And the spirit of mine  understanding Doth cause me to answer:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB20_4" data-id="JB20_4">This hast thou known from antiquity? Since the placing of  man on earth?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB20_5" data-id="JB20_5">That the singing of the wicked [is] short, And the joy of  the profane for a moment,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB20_6" data-id="JB20_6">Though his excellency go up to the heavens, And his head  against a cloud he strike --</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB20_7" data-id="JB20_7">As his own dung for ever he doth perish, His beholders say:  `Where [is] he?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB20_8" data-id="JB20_8">As a dream he fleeth, and they find him not, And he is  driven away as a vision of the night,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB20_9" data-id="JB20_9">The eye hath not seen him, and addeth not. And not again  doth his place behold him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB20_10" data-id="JB20_10">His sons do the poor oppress, And his hands give back his  wealth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB20_11" data-id="JB20_11">His bones have been full of his youth, And with him on the  dust it lieth down.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB20_12" data-id="JB20_12">Though he doth sweeten evil in his mouth, Doth hide it  under his tongue,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB20_13" data-id="JB20_13">Hath pity on it, and doth not forsake it, And keep it back  in the midst of his palate,</span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB20_18" data-id="JB20_18">He is giving back [what] he laboured for, And doth not  consume [it]; As a bulwark [is] his exchange, and he exults  not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB20_19" data-id="JB20_19">For he oppressed -- he forsook the poor, A house he hath  taken violently away, And he doth not build it.</span>

<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB20_23" data-id="JB20_23">It cometh to pass, at the filling of his belly, He sendeth  forth against him The fierceness of His anger, Yea, He raineth  on him in his eating.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB20_24" data-id="JB20_24">He fleeth from an iron weapon, Pass through him doth a bow  of brass.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB20_25" data-id="JB20_25">One hath drawn, And it cometh out from the body, And a  glittering weapon from his gall proceedeth. On him [are]  terrors.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB20_26" data-id="JB20_26">All darkness is hid for his treasures, Consume him doth a  fire not blown, Broken is the remnant in his tent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB20_27" data-id="JB20_27">Reveal do the heavens his iniquity, And earth is raising  itself against him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB20_28" data-id="JB20_28">Remove doth the increase of his house, Poured forth in a  day of His anger.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB20_29" data-id="JB20_29">This [is] the portion of a wicked man from God. And an  inheritance appointed him by God.</span>
