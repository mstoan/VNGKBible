<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS3_2" data-id="IS3_2">Hero and man of war, judge and prophet, And diviner and  elder,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS3_3" data-id="IS3_3">Head of fifty, and accepted of faces, And counsellor, and  the wise of artificers, And the intelligent of charmers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS3_4" data-id="IS3_4">And I have made youths their heads, And sucklings rule over  them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS3_5" data-id="IS3_5">And the people hath exacted -- man upon man, Even a man on  his neighbour, Enlarge themselves do the youths against the  aged, And the lightly esteemed against the honoured.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS3_6" data-id="IS3_6">When one layeth hold on his brother, [Of] the house of his  father, [by] the garment, `Come, a ruler thou art to us, And  this ruin [is] under thy hand.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS3_7" data-id="IS3_7">He lifteth up, in that day, saying: `I am not a binder up,  And in my house is neither bread nor garment, Ye do not make me  a ruler of the people.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS3_8" data-id="IS3_8">For stumbled hath Jerusalem, and Judah hath fallen, For  their tongue and their doings [are] against Jehovah, To provoke  the eyes of His glory.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS3_9" data-id="IS3_9">The appearance of their faces witnessed against them, And  their sin, as Sodom, they declared, They have not hidden! Wo to  their soul, For they have done to themselves evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS3_10" data-id="IS3_10">Say ye to the righteous, that [it is] good, Because the  fruit of their doings they eat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS3_11" data-id="IS3_11">Wo to the wicked -- evil, Because the deed of his hand is  done to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS3_12" data-id="IS3_12">My people -- its exactors [are] sucklings, And women have  ruled over it. My people -- thy eulogists are causing to err,  And the way of thy paths swallowed up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS3_13" data-id="IS3_13">Jehovah hath stood up to plead, And He is standing to judge  the peoples.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS3_14" data-id="IS3_14">Jehovah into judgment doth enter With elders of His people,  and its heads: `And ye, ye have consumed the vineyard, Plunder  of the poor [is] in your houses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS3_15" data-id="IS3_15">What -- to you? ye bruise My people, And the faces of the  poor ye grind.' An affirmation of the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts,  And Jehovah saith:</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS3_16" data-id="IS3_16">`Because that daughters of Zion have been haughty, And they  walk stretching out the neck, And deceiving [with] the eyes,  Walking and mincing they go, And with their feet they make a  tinkling,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS3_17" data-id="IS3_17">The Lord also hath scabbed The crown of the head of  daughters of Zion, And Jehovah their simplicity exposeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS3_18" data-id="IS3_18">In that day doth the Lord turn aside The beauty of the  tinkling ornaments, And of the embroidered works, And of the  round tires like moons,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS3_19" data-id="IS3_19">Of the drops, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS3_20" data-id="IS3_20">Of the bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, And of the  bands, And of the perfume boxes, and the amulets,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS3_21" data-id="IS3_21">Of the seals, and of the nose-rings,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS3_22" data-id="IS3_22">Of the costly apparel, and of the mantles, And of the  coverings, and of the purses,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS3_23" data-id="IS3_23">Of the mirrors, and of the linen garments, And of the  hoods, and of the vails,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS3_24" data-id="IS3_24">And it hath been, instead of spice is muck, And instead of  a girdle, a rope, And instead of curled work, baldness, And  instead of a stomacher a girdle of sackcloth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS3_25" data-id="IS3_25">For instead of glory, thy men by sword do fall, And thy  might in battle.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS3_26" data-id="IS3_26">And lamented and mourned have her openings, Yea, she hath  been emptied, on the earth she sitteth!</span>
