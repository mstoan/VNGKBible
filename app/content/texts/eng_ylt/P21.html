<div class="mt">2 Peter</div><div class="c">1</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_1" data-id="P21_1">Simeon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to  those who did obtain a like precious faith with us in the  righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_2" data-id="P21_2">Grace to you, and peace be multiplied in the acknowledgement  of God and of Jesus our Lord!</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_3" data-id="P21_3">As all things to us His divine power (the things pertaining  unto life and piety) hath given, through the acknowledgement  of him who did call us through glory and worthiness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_4" data-id="P21_4">through which to us the most great and precious promises  have been given, that through these ye may become partakers of  a divine nature, having escaped from the corruption in the  world in desires.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_5" data-id="P21_5">And this same also -- all diligence having brought in  besides, superadd in your faith the worthiness, and in the  worthiness the knowledge,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_6" data-id="P21_6">and in the knowledge the temperance, and in the temperance  the endurance, and in the endurance the piety,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_7" data-id="P21_7">and in the piety the brotherly kindness, and in the  brotherly kindness the love;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_8" data-id="P21_8">for these things being to you and abounding, do make [you]  neither inert nor unfruitful in regard to the acknowledging of  our Lord Jesus Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_9" data-id="P21_9">for he with whom these things are not present is blind,  dim-sighted, having become forgetful of the cleansing of his  old sins;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_10" data-id="P21_10">wherefore, the rather, brethren, be diligent to make  stedfast your calling and choice, for these things doing, ye  may never stumble,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_11" data-id="P21_11">for so, richly shall be superadded to you the entrance into  the age-during reign of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_12" data-id="P21_12">Wherefore, I will not be careless always to remind you  concerning these things, though, having known them, and having  been established in the present truth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_13" data-id="P21_13">and I think right, so long as I am in this tabernacle, to  stir you up in reminding [you],</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_14" data-id="P21_14">having known that soon is the laying aside of my  tabernacle, even as also our Lord Jesus Christ did shew to me,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_15" data-id="P21_15">and I will be diligent that also at every time ye have,  after my outgoing, power to make to yourselves the remembrance  of these things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_16" data-id="P21_16">For, skilfully devised fables not having followed out, we  did make known to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus  Christ, but eye-witnesses having become of his majesty --</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_17" data-id="P21_17">for having received from God the Father honour and glory,  such a voice being borne to him by the excellent glory: `This  is My Son -- the beloved, in whom I was well pleased;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_18" data-id="P21_18">and this voice we -- we did hear, out of heaven borne,  being with him in the holy mount.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_19" data-id="P21_19">And we have more firm the prophetic word, to which we do  well giving heed, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, till  day may dawn, and a morning star may arise -- in your hearts;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_20" data-id="P21_20">this first knowing, that no prophecy of the Writing doth  come of private exposition,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v P21_21" data-id="P21_21">for not by will of man did ever prophecy come, but by the  Holy Spirit borne on holy men of God spake.</span>
