<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_2" data-id="MT28_2">and lo, there came a great earthquake, for a messenger of  the Lord, having come down out of heaven, having come, did roll  away the stone from the door, and was sitting upon it,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_3" data-id="MT28_3">and his countenance was as lightning, and his clothing  white as snow,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_4" data-id="MT28_4">and from the fear of him did the keepers shake, and they  became as dead men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_5" data-id="MT28_5">And the messenger answering said to the women, `Fear not  ye, for I have known that Jesus, who hath been crucified, ye  seek;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_6" data-id="MT28_6">he is not here, for he rose, as he said; come, see the  place where the Lord was lying;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_7" data-id="MT28_7">and having gone quickly, say ye to his disciples, that he  rose from the dead; and lo, he doth go before you to Galilee,  there ye shall see him; lo, I have told you.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_8" data-id="MT28_8">And having gone forth quickly from the tomb, with fear and  great joy, they ran to tell to his disciples;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_9" data-id="MT28_9">and as they were going to tell to his disciples, then lo,  Jesus met them, saying, `Hail!' and they having come near, laid  hold of his feet, and did bow to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_10" data-id="MT28_10">Then saith Jesus to them, `Fear ye not, go away, tell to  my brethren that they may go away to Galilee, and there they  shall see me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_11" data-id="MT28_11">And while they are going on, lo, certain of the watch  having come to the city, told to the chief priests all the  things that happened,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_12" data-id="MT28_12">and having been gathered together with the elders, counsel  also having taken, they gave much money to the soldiers,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_13" data-id="MT28_13">saying, `Say ye, that his disciples having come by night,  stole him -- we being asleep;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_14" data-id="MT28_14">and if this be heard by the governor, we will persuade  him, and you keep free from anxiety.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_15" data-id="MT28_15">And they, having received the money, did as they were  taught, and this account was spread abroad among Jews till this  day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_16" data-id="MT28_16">And the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mount  where Jesus appointed them,</span>
