<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_2" data-id="JR50_2">`Declare ye among nations, and sound, And lift up an  ensign, sound, do not hide, Say ye: Captured hath been Babylon,  Put to shame hath been Bel, Broken hath been Merodach, Put to  shame have been her grievous things, Broken have been her  idols.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_3" data-id="JR50_3">For come up against her hath a nation from the north, It  maketh her land become a desolation, And there is not an  inhabitant in it. From man even unto beast, They have moved,  they have gone.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_4" data-id="JR50_4">In those days, and at that time, An affirmation of Jehovah,  Come in do sons of Israel, They and sons of Judah together,  Going on and weeping they go, And Jehovah their God they seek.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_5" data-id="JR50_5">[To] Zion they ask the way, Thitherward [are] their faces:  Come in, and we are joined unto Jehovah, A covenant age-during  -- not forgotten.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_6" data-id="JR50_6">A perishing flock hath My people been, Their shepherds have  caused them to err, [To] the mountains causing them to go back,  From mountain unto hill they have gone, They have forgotten  their crouching-place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_7" data-id="JR50_7">All finding them have devoured them, And their adversaries  have said: We are not guilty, Because that they sinned against  Jehovah, The habitation of righteousness, And the hope of their  fathers -- Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_8" data-id="JR50_8">Move ye from the midst of Babylon, And from the land of the  Chaldeans go out. And be as he-goats before a flock.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_9" data-id="JR50_9">For, lo, I am stirring up, And am causing to come up  against Babylon, An assembly of great nations from a land of  the north, And they have set in array against her, From thence  she is captured, Its arrow -- as a skilful hero -- returneth  not empty,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_10" data-id="JR50_10">And Chaldea hath been for a spoil, All her spoilers are  satisfied, An affirmation of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_11" data-id="JR50_11">Because thou rejoicest, because thou exultest, O spoilers  of Mine inheritance, Because thou increasest as a heifer [at]  the tender grass, And dost cry aloud as bulls,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_12" data-id="JR50_12">Ashamed hath been your mother greatly, Confounded hath she  been that bare you, Lo, the hindermost of nations [is] a  wilderness, A dry land, and a desert.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_13" data-id="JR50_13">Because of the wrath of Jehovah it is not inhabited, And  it hath been a desolation -- all of it. Every passer by at  Babylon is astonished, And doth hiss because of all her  plagues.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_14" data-id="JR50_14">Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about, All  ye treading a bow, Shoot at her, have no pity on the arrow, For  against Jehovah she hath sinned.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_15" data-id="JR50_15">Shout against her round about, She hath given forth her  hand, Fallen have her foundations, Thrown down have been her  walls, For it [is] the vengeance of Jehovah, Be avenged of her,  as she did -- do ye to her.</span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_18" data-id="JR50_18">Therefore thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel: Lo, I  am seeing after the king of Babylon, And after his land, As I  have seen after the king of Asshur;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_19" data-id="JR50_19">And I have brought back Israel unto his habitation, And he  hath fed on Carmel, and on Bashan. And in mount Ephraim, and on  Gilead is his soul satisfied.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_20" data-id="JR50_20">In those days, and at that time, An affirmation of  Jehovah, Sought is the iniquity of Israel, and it is not, And  the sin of Judah, and it is not found, For I am propitious to  those whom I leave!</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_21" data-id="JR50_21">Against the land of Merathaim: Go up against it, and unto  the inhabitants of Pekod, Waste and devote their posterity, An  affirmation of Jehovah, And do according to all that I have  commanded thee.</span>

<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_27" data-id="JR50_27">Slay all her kine, they go down to slaughter, Wo [is] on  them, for come hath their day, The time of their inspection.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_28" data-id="JR50_28">A voice of fugitives and escaped ones [Is] from the land  of Babylon, To declare in Zion the vengeance of Jehovah our  God, The vengeance of His temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_29" data-id="JR50_29">Summon unto Babylon archers, all treading the bow, Encamp  against her round about, Let [her] have no escape; Recompense  to her according to her work, According to all that she did --  do to her, For unto Jehovah she hath been proud, Unto the Holy  One of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_30" data-id="JR50_30">Therefore fall do her young men in her broad places, And  all her men of war are cut off in that day, An affirmation of  Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_31" data-id="JR50_31">Lo, I [am] against thee, O pride, An affirmation of the  Lord Jehovah of Hosts, For thy day hath come, the time of thy  inspection.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_32" data-id="JR50_32">And stumbled hath pride, And he hath fallen, and hath no  raiser up, And I have kindled a fire in his cities, And it hath  devoured all round about him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_33" data-id="JR50_33">Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Oppressed are the sons of  Israel, And the sons of Judah together, And all their captors  have kept hold on them, They have refused to send them away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_34" data-id="JR50_34">Their Redeemer [is] strong, Jehovah of Hosts [is] His  name, He doth thoroughly plead their cause, So as to cause the  land to rest, And He hath given trouble to the inhabitants of  Babylon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_35" data-id="JR50_35">A sword [is] for the Chaldeans, An affirmation of Jehovah,  And it [is] on the inhabitants of Babylon, And on her heads,  and on her wise men;</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_36" data-id="JR50_36">A sword [is] on the princes, And they have become foolish;  A sword [is] on her mighty ones, And they have been broken  down;</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_37" data-id="JR50_37">A sword [is] on his horses and on his chariot, And on all  the rabble who [are] in her midst, And they have become women;  A sword [is] on her treasuries, And they have been spoiled;</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_38" data-id="JR50_38">A sword [is] on her waters, and they have been dried up,  For it [is] a land of graven images, And in idols they do boast  themselves.</span>
