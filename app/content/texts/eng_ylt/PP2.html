<div class="c">2</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_1" data-id="PP2_1">If, then, any exhortation [is] in Christ, if any comfort of  love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_2" data-id="PP2_2">fulfil ye my joy, that ye may mind the same thing -- having  the same love -- of one soul -- minding the one thing,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_3" data-id="PP2_3">nothing in rivalry or vain-glory, but in humility of mind  one another counting more excellent than yourselves --</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_4" data-id="PP2_4">each not to your own look ye, but each also to the things of  others.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_5" data-id="PP2_5">For, let this mind be in you that [is] also in Christ Jesus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_6" data-id="PP2_6">who, being in the form of God, thought [it] not robbery to  be equal to God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_7" data-id="PP2_7">but did empty himself, the form of a servant having taken,  in the likeness of men having been made,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_8" data-id="PP2_8">and in fashion having been found as a man, he humbled  himself, having become obedient unto death -- death even of a  cross,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_9" data-id="PP2_9">wherefore, also, God did highly exalt him, and gave to him a  name that [is] above every name,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_10" data-id="PP2_10">that in the name of Jesus every knee may bow -- of  heavenlies, and earthlies, and what are under the earth --</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_11" data-id="PP2_11">and every tongue may confess that Jesus Christ [is] Lord,  to the glory of God the Father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_12" data-id="PP2_12">So that, my beloved, as ye always obey, not as in my  presence only, but now much more in my absence, with fear and  trembling your own salvation work out,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_13" data-id="PP2_13">for God it is who is working in you both to will and to  work for His good pleasure.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_14" data-id="PP2_14">All things do without murmurings and reasonings,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_15" data-id="PP2_15">that ye may become blameless and harmless, children of God,  unblemished in the midst of a generation crooked and perverse,  among whom ye do appear as luminaries in the world,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_16" data-id="PP2_16">the word of life holding forth, for rejoicing to me in  regard to a day of Christ, that not in vain did I run, nor in  vain did I labour;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_17" data-id="PP2_17">but if also I am poured forth upon the sacrifice and  service of your faith, I rejoice and joy with you all,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_18" data-id="PP2_18">because of this do ye also rejoice and joy with me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_19" data-id="PP2_19">And I hope, in the Lord Jesus, Timotheus to send quickly to  you, that I also may be of good spirit, having known the  things concerning you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_20" data-id="PP2_20">for I have no one like-minded, who sincerely for the things  concerning you will care,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_21" data-id="PP2_21">for the whole seek their own things, not the things of the  Christ Jesus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_22" data-id="PP2_22">and the proof of him ye know, that as a child [serveth] a  father, with me he did serve in regard to the good news;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_23" data-id="PP2_23">him, indeed, therefore, I hope to send, when I may see  through the things concerning me -- immediately;</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_24" data-id="PP2_24">and I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall quickly  come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_25" data-id="PP2_25">And I thought [it] necessary Epaphroditus -- my brother,  and fellow-workman, and fellow-soldier, and your apostle and  servant to my need -- to send unto you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_26" data-id="PP2_26">seeing he was longing after you all, and in heaviness,  because ye heard that he ailed,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_27" data-id="PP2_27">for he also ailed nigh to death, but God did deal kindly  with him, and not with him only, but also with me, that sorrow  upon sorrow I might not have.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_28" data-id="PP2_28">The more eagerly, therefore, I did send him, that having  seen him again ye may rejoice, and I may be the less  sorrowful;</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_29" data-id="PP2_29">receive him, therefore, in the Lord, with all joy, and hold  such in honour,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_30" data-id="PP2_30">because on account of the work of the Christ he drew near  to death, having hazarded the life that he might fill up your  deficiency of service unto me.</span>
