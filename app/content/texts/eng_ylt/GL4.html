<div class="c">4</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_1" data-id="GL4_1">And I say, so long time as the heir is a babe, he differeth  nothing from a servant -- being lord of all,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_2" data-id="GL4_2">but is under tutors and stewards till the time appointed of  the father,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_3" data-id="GL4_3">so also we, when we were babes, under the elements of the  world were in servitude,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_4" data-id="GL4_4">and when the fulness of time did come, God sent forth His  Son, come of a woman, come under law,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_5" data-id="GL4_5">that those under law he may redeem, that the adoption of  sons we may receive;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_6" data-id="GL4_6">and because ye are sons, God did send forth the spirit of  His Son into your hearts, crying, `Abba, Father!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_7" data-id="GL4_7">so that thou art no more a servant, but a son, and if a son,  also an heir of God through Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_8" data-id="GL4_8">But then, indeed, not having known God, ye were in servitude  to those not by nature gods,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_9" data-id="GL4_9">and now, having known God -- and rather being known by God  -- how turn ye again unto the weak and poor elements to which  anew ye desire to be in servitude?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_10" data-id="GL4_10">days ye observe, and months, and times, and years!</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_11" data-id="GL4_11">I am afraid of you, lest in vain I did labour toward you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_12" data-id="GL4_12">Become as I [am] -- because I also [am] as ye brethren, I  beseech you; to me ye did no hurt,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_13" data-id="GL4_13">and ye have known that through infirmity of the flesh I did  proclaim good news to you at the first,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_14" data-id="GL4_14">and my trial that [is] in my flesh ye did not despise nor  reject, but as a messenger of God ye did receive me -- as  Christ Jesus;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_15" data-id="GL4_15">what then was your happiness? for I testify to you, that if  possible, your eyes having plucked out, ye would have given to  me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_16" data-id="GL4_16">so that your enemy have I become, being true to you?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_17" data-id="GL4_17">they are zealous for you -- [yet] not well, but they wish  to shut us out, that for them ye may be zealous;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_18" data-id="GL4_18">and [it is] good to be zealously regarded, in what is good,  at all times, and not only in my being present with you;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_19" data-id="GL4_19">my little children, of whom again I travail in birth, till  Christ may be formed in you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_20" data-id="GL4_20">and I was wishing to be present with you now, and to change  my voice, because I am in doubt about you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_21" data-id="GL4_21">Tell me, ye who are willing to be under law, the law do ye  not hear?</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_22" data-id="GL4_22">for it hath been written, that Abraham had two sons, one by  the maid-servant, and one by the free-woman,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_23" data-id="GL4_23">but he who [is] of the maid-servant, according to flesh  hath been, and he who [is] of the free-woman, through the  promise;</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_24" data-id="GL4_24">which things are allegorized, for these are the two  covenants: one, indeed, from mount Sinai, to servitude bringing  forth, which is Hagar;</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_25" data-id="GL4_25">for this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and doth  correspond to the Jerusalem that now [is], and is in servitude  with her children,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_26" data-id="GL4_26">and the Jerusalem above is the free-woman, which is mother  of us all,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_27" data-id="GL4_27">for it hath been written, `Rejoice, O barren, who art not  bearing; break forth and cry, thou who art not travailing,  because many [are] the children of the desolate -- more than of  her having the husband.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_28" data-id="GL4_28">And we, brethren, as Isaac, are children of promise,</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_29" data-id="GL4_29">but as then he who was born according to the flesh did  persecute him according to the spirit, so also now;</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_30" data-id="GL4_30">but what saith the Writing? `Cast forth the maid-servant  and her son, for the son of the maid-servant may not be heir  with the son of the free-woman;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_31" data-id="GL4_31">then, brethren, we are not a maid-servant's children, but  the free-woman's.</span>
