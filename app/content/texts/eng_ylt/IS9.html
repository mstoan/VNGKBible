<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS9_8" data-id="IS9_8">A word hath the Lord sent into Jacob, And it hath fallen in  Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS9_9" data-id="IS9_9">And the people have known -- all of it, Ephraim, and the  inhabitant of Samaria, In pride and in greatness of heart,  saying,</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS9_17" data-id="IS9_17">Therefore, over its young men the Lord rejoiceth not, And  its orphans, and its widows He pitieth not, For every one [is]  profane, and an evil doer, And every mouth is speaking folly.  With all this not turned back hath His anger, And still His  hand is stretched out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS9_18" data-id="IS9_18">For burned as a fire hath wickedness, Brier and thorn it  devoureth, And it kindleth in thickets of the forest, And they  lift themselves up, an exaltation of smoke!</span>
