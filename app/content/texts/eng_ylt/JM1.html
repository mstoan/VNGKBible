<div class="mt">James</div><div class="c">1</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_1" data-id="JM1_1">James, of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ a servant, to the  Twelve Tribes who are in the dispersion: Hail!</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_2" data-id="JM1_2">All joy count [it], my brethren, when ye may fall into  temptations manifold;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_3" data-id="JM1_3">knowing that the proof of your faith doth work endurance,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_4" data-id="JM1_4">and let the endurance have a perfect work, that ye may be  perfect and entire -- in nothing lacking;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_5" data-id="JM1_5">and if any of you do lack wisdom, let him ask from God, who  is giving to all liberally, and not reproaching, and it shall  be given to him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_6" data-id="JM1_6">and let him ask in faith, nothing doubting, for he who is  doubting hath been like a wave of the sea, driven by wind and  tossed,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_7" data-id="JM1_7">for let not that man suppose that he shall receive anything  from the Lord --</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_8" data-id="JM1_8">a two-souled man [is] unstable in all his ways.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_9" data-id="JM1_9">And let the brother who is low rejoice in his exaltation,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_10" data-id="JM1_10">and the rich in his becoming low, because as a flower of  grass he shall pass away;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_11" data-id="JM1_11">for the sun did rise with the burning heat, and did wither  the grass, and the flower of it fell, and the grace of its  appearance did perish, so also the rich in his way shall fade  away!</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_12" data-id="JM1_12">Happy the man who doth endure temptation, because, becoming  approved, he shall receive the crown of the life, which the  Lord did promise to those loving Him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_13" data-id="JM1_13">Let no one say, being tempted -- `From God I am tempted,'  for God is not tempted of evil, and Himself doth tempt no one,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_14" data-id="JM1_14">and each one is tempted, by his own desires being led away  and enticed,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_15" data-id="JM1_15">afterward the desire having conceived, doth give birth to  sin, and the sin having been perfected, doth bring forth  death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_16" data-id="JM1_16">Be not led astray, my brethren beloved;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_17" data-id="JM1_17">every good giving, and every perfect gift is from above,  coming down from the Father of the lights, with whom is no  variation, or shadow of turning;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_18" data-id="JM1_18">having counselled, He did beget us with a word of truth,  for our being a certain first-fruit of His creatures.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_19" data-id="JM1_19">So then, my brethren beloved, let every man be swift to  hear, slow to speak, slow to anger,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_20" data-id="JM1_20">for the wrath of a man the righteousness of God doth not  work;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_21" data-id="JM1_21">wherefore having put aside all filthiness and  superabundance of evil, in meekness be receiving the engrafted  word, that is able to save your souls;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_22" data-id="JM1_22">and become ye doers of the word, and not hearers only,  deceiving yourselves,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_23" data-id="JM1_23">because, if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer,  this one hath been like to a man viewing his natural face in a  mirror,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_24" data-id="JM1_24">for he did view himself, and hath gone away, and  immediately he did forget of what kind he was;</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_25" data-id="JM1_25">and he who did look into the perfect law -- that of  liberty, and did continue there, this one -- not a forgetful  hearer becoming, but a doer of work -- this one shall be happy  in his doing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_26" data-id="JM1_26">If any one doth think to be religious among you, not  bridling his tongue, but deceiving his heart, of this one vain  [is] the religion;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_27" data-id="JM1_27">religion pure and undefiled with the God and Father is  this, to look after orphans and widows in their tribulation --  unspotted to keep himself from the world.</span>
