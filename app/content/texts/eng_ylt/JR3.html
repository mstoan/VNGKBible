<div class="c">3</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_1" data-id="JR3_1">Saying, `Lo, one sendeth away his wife, And she hath gone  from him, And she hath been to another man, Doth he turn back  unto her again? Greatly defiled is not that land? And thou hast  committed whoredom with many lovers, And turn again to Me, an  affirmation of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_2" data-id="JR3_2">Lift thine eyes to the high places, and see, Where hast thou  not been lain with? On the ways thou hast sat for them, As an  Arab in a wilderness, And thou defilest the land, By thy  fornications, and by thy wickedness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_3" data-id="JR3_3">And withheld are showers, and gathered rain hath not been.  The forehead of a whorish woman thou hast, Thou hast refused to  be ashamed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_4" data-id="JR3_4">Hast thou not henceforth called to Me, `My father, Thou  [art] the leader of my youth?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_5" data-id="JR3_5">Doth He keep to the age? watch for ever?' Lo, these things  thou hast spoken, And thou dost the evil things, and  prevailest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_6" data-id="JR3_6">And Jehovah saith unto me, in the days of Josiah the king,  `Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? She is  going on every high mountain, and unto the place of every green  tree, and committeth fornication there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_7" data-id="JR3_7">And I say, after her doing all these, Unto Me thou dost turn  back, and she hath not turned back, and see [it] doth her  treacherous sister Judah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_8" data-id="JR3_8">And I see when (for all the causes whereby backsliding  Israel committed adultery) I have sent her away, and I give the  bill of her divorce unto her, that treacherous Judah her sister  hath not feared, and goeth and committeth fornication -- she  also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_9" data-id="JR3_9">And it hath come to pass, from the vileness of her  fornication, that the land is defiled, and she committeth  fornication with stone and with wood.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_10" data-id="JR3_10">And even in all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not  turned back unto Me with all her heart, but with falsehood, an  affirmation of Jehovah.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_11" data-id="JR3_11">And Jehovah saith unto me: `Justified herself hath  backsliding Israel, More than treacherous Judah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_12" data-id="JR3_12">Go, and thou hast proclaimed these words toward the north,  and hast said, Turn back, O backsliding Israel, An affirmation  of Jehovah! I cause not Mine anger to fall upon you, For I [am]  kind, an affirmation of Jehovah, I watch not to the age.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_13" data-id="JR3_13">Only, know thine iniquity, For against Jehovah thy God thou  hast transgressed, And thou dost scatter thy ways to strangers,  Under every green tree, And to My voice thou hast not  hearkened, An affirmation of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_14" data-id="JR3_14">Turn back, O backsliding sons, An affirmation of Jehovah.  For I have ruled over you, And taken you one of a city, and two  of a family, And have brought you to Zion,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_15" data-id="JR3_15">And I have given to you shepherds According to Mine own  heart, And they have fed you with knowledge and understanding.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_16" data-id="JR3_16">And it hath come to pass, when ye are multiplied, And have  been fruitful in the land, In those days -- an affirmation of  Jehovah, They say not any more, `The ark of the covenant of  Jehovah,' Nor doth it go up on the heart, Nor do they remember  concerning it, Nor do they inspect, nor is it made again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_17" data-id="JR3_17">At that time they cry to Jerusalem, `O throne of Jehovah,'  And gathered unto her hath been all the nations, For the name  of Jehovah, to Jerusalem, Nor do they go any more after the  stubbornness of their evil heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_18" data-id="JR3_18">In those days do the house of Judah Go unto the house of  Israel, And they come together from the land of the south, unto  the land That I caused your fathers to inherit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_19" data-id="JR3_19">And I have said, How do I put thee among the sons, And give  to thee a desirable land, A beauteous inheritance of the hosts  of nations, And I say, My father -- ye do call to Me, And from  after Me ye do not turn back.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_20" data-id="JR3_20">But -- a woman hath deceived her friend, So ye have dealt  treacherously with Me, O house of Israel, an affirmation of  Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_21" data-id="JR3_21">A voice on high places is heard -- weeping, Supplications  of the sons of Israel, For they have made perverse their way,  They have forgotten Jehovah their God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_22" data-id="JR3_22">Turn back, O backsliding sons, I cause your backslidings to  cease. -- Behold us, we have come to Thee, For Thou [art]  Jehovah our God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_23" data-id="JR3_23">Surely in vain from the heights, The multitude of mountains  -- Surely in Jehovah our God [is] the salvation of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_24" data-id="JR3_24">And the shameful thing hath devoured The labour of our  fathers from our youth, Their flock and their herd, Their sons  and their daughters.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR3_25" data-id="JR3_25">We have lain down in our shame, and cover us doth our  confusion, For against Jehovah our God we have sinned, We, and  our fathers, from our youth even unto this day, Nor have we  hearkened to the voice of Jehovah our God!</span>
