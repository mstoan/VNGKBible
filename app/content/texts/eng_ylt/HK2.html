<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_2" data-id="HK2_2">And Jehovah answereth me and saith: `Write a vision, and  explain on the tables, That he may run who is reading it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_3" data-id="HK2_3">For yet the vision [is] for a season, And it breatheth for  the end, and doth not lie, If it tarry, wait for it, For surely  it cometh, it is not late.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_4" data-id="HK2_4">Lo, a presumptuous one! Not upright is his soul within him,  And the righteous by his stedfastness liveth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_5" data-id="HK2_5">And also, because the wine [is] treacherous, A man is  haughty, and remaineth not at home, Who hath enlarged as sheol  his soul, And is as death that is not satisfied, And doth  gather unto itself all the nations, And doth assemble unto  itself all the peoples,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_6" data-id="HK2_6">Do not these -- all of them -- against him a simile taken  up, And a moral of acute sayings for him, And say, Wo [to] him  who is multiplying [what is] not his? Till when also is he  multiplying to himself heavy pledges?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_7" data-id="HK2_7">Do not thy usurers instantly rise up, And those shaking thee  awake up, And thou hast been for a spoil to them?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_8" data-id="HK2_8">Because thou hast spoiled many nations, Spoil thee do all  the remnant of the peoples, Because of man's blood, and of  violence [to] the land, [To] the city, and [to] all dwelling in  it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_9" data-id="HK2_9">Wo [to] him who is gaining evil gain for his house, To set  on high his nest, To be delivered from the hand of evil,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_10" data-id="HK2_10">Thou hast counselled a shameful thing to thy house, To cut  off many peoples, and sinful [is] thy soul.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_11" data-id="HK2_11">For a stone from the wall doth cry out, And a holdfast from  the wood answereth it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_12" data-id="HK2_12">Wo [to] him who is building a city by blood, And  establishing a city by iniquity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_13" data-id="HK2_13">Lo, is it not from Jehovah of Hosts And peoples are  fatigued for fire, And nations for vanity are weary?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_14" data-id="HK2_14">For full is the earth of the knowledge of the honour of  Jehovah, As waters cover [the bottom of] a sea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_15" data-id="HK2_15">Wo [to] him who is giving drink to his neighbour, Pouring  out thy bottle, and also making drunk, In order to look on  their nakedness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_16" data-id="HK2_16">Thou hast been filled -- shame without honour, Drink thou  also, and be uncircumcised, Turn round unto thee doth the cup  of the right hand of Jehovah, And shameful spewing [is] on  thine honour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_17" data-id="HK2_17">For violence [to] Lebanon doth cover thee, And spoil of  beasts doth affright them, Because of man's blood, and of  violence [to] the land, [To] the city, and [to] all dwelling in  it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_18" data-id="HK2_18">What profit hath a graven image given That its former hath  graven it? A molten image and teacher of falsehood, That  trusted hath the former on his own formation -- to make dumb  idols?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_19" data-id="HK2_19">Wo [to] him who is saying to wood, `Awake,' `Stir up,' to a  dumb stone, It a teacher! lo, it is overlaid -- gold and  silver, And there is no spirit in its midst.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_20" data-id="HK2_20">And Jehovah [is] in His holy temple, Be silent before Him,  all the earth!</span>
