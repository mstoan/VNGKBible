<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_2" data-id="PS78_2">I open with a simile my mouth, I bring forth hidden things  of old,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_3" data-id="PS78_3">That we have heard and do know, And our fathers have  recounted to us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_4" data-id="PS78_4">We do not hide from their sons, To a later generation  recounting praises of Jehovah, And His strength, and His  wonders that He hath done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_5" data-id="PS78_5">And He raiseth up a testimony in Jacob, And a law hath  placed in Israel, That He commanded our fathers, To make them  known to their sons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_6" data-id="PS78_6">So that a later generation doth know, Sons who are born, do  rise and recount to their sons,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_7" data-id="PS78_7">And place in God their confidence, And forget not the  doings of God, But keep His commands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_8" data-id="PS78_8">And they are not like their fathers, A generation apostate  and rebellious, A generation! it hath not prepared its heart,  Nor stedfast with God [is] its spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_9" data-id="PS78_9">Sons of Ephraim -- armed bearers of bow, Have turned in a  day of conflict.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_10" data-id="PS78_10">They have not kept the covenant of God, And in His law  they have refused to walk,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_11" data-id="PS78_11">And they forget His doings, And His wonders that He shewed  them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_12" data-id="PS78_12">Before their fathers He hath done wonders, In the land of  Egypt -- the field of Zoan.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_13" data-id="PS78_13">He cleft a sea, and causeth them to pass over, Yea, He  causeth waters to stand as a heap.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_14" data-id="PS78_14">And leadeth them with a cloud by day, And all the night  with a light of fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_15" data-id="PS78_15">He cleaveth rocks in a wilderness, And giveth drink -- as  the great deep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_16" data-id="PS78_16">And bringeth out streams from a rock, And causeth waters  to come down as rivers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_17" data-id="PS78_17">And they add still to sin against Him, To provoke the Most  High in the dry place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_18" data-id="PS78_18">And they try God in their heart, To ask food for their  lust.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_19" data-id="PS78_19">And they speak against God -- they said: `Is God able to  array a table in a wilderness?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_20" data-id="PS78_20">Lo, He hath smitten a rock, And waters flow, yea, streams  overflow. `Also -- bread [is] He able to give? Doth He prepare  flesh for His people?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_21" data-id="PS78_21">Therefore hath Jehovah heard, And He sheweth Himself  wroth, And fire hath been kindled against Jacob, And anger also  hath gone up against Israel,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_22" data-id="PS78_22">For they have not believed in God, Nor have they trusted  in His salvation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_23" data-id="PS78_23">And He commandeth clouds from above, Yea, doors of the  heavens He hath opened.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_24" data-id="PS78_24">And He raineth on them manna to eat, Yea, corn of heaven  He hath given to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_25" data-id="PS78_25">Food of the mighty hath each eaten, Venison He sent to  them to satiety.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_26" data-id="PS78_26">He causeth an east wind to journey in the heavens, And  leadeth by His strength a south wind,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_27" data-id="PS78_27">And He raineth on them flesh as dust, And as sand of the  seas -- winged fowl,</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_28" data-id="PS78_28">And causeth [it] to fall in the midst of His camp, Round  about His tabernacles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_29" data-id="PS78_29">And they eat, and are greatly satisfied, And their desire  He bringeth to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_30" data-id="PS78_30">They have not been estranged from their desire, Yet [is]  their food in their mouth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_31" data-id="PS78_31">And the anger of God hath gone up against them, And He  slayeth among their fat ones, And youths of Israel He caused to  bend.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_32" data-id="PS78_32">With all this they have sinned again, And have not  believed in His wonders.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_33" data-id="PS78_33">And He consumeth in vanity their days, And their years in  trouble.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_34" data-id="PS78_34">If He slew them, then they sought Him, And turned back,  and sought God earnestly,</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_35" data-id="PS78_35">And they remember that God [is] their rock, And God Most  High their redeemer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_36" data-id="PS78_36">And -- they deceive Him with their mouth, And with their  tongue do lie to Him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_37" data-id="PS78_37">And their heart hath not been right with Him, And they  have not been stedfast in His covenant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_38" data-id="PS78_38">And He -- the Merciful One, Pardoneth iniquity, and  destroyeth not, And hath often turned back His anger, And  waketh not up all His fury.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_39" data-id="PS78_39">And He remembereth that they [are] flesh, A wind going on  -- and it returneth not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_40" data-id="PS78_40">How often do they provoke Him in the wilderness, Grieve  Him in the desolate place?</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_41" data-id="PS78_41">Yea, they turn back, and try God, And the Holy One of  Israel have limited.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_42" data-id="PS78_42">They have not remembered His hand The day He ransomed them  from the adversary.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_43" data-id="PS78_43">When He set His signs in Egypt, And His wonders in the  field of Zoan,</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_44" data-id="PS78_44">And He turneth to blood their streams, And their floods  they drink not.</span>

<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_47" data-id="PS78_47">He destroyeth with hail their vine, And their sycamores  with frost,</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_48" data-id="PS78_48">And delivereth up to the hail their beasts, And their  cattle to the burning flames.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_49" data-id="PS78_49">He sendeth on them the fury of His anger, Wrath, and  indignation, and distress -- A discharge of evil messengers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_50" data-id="PS78_50">He pondereth a path for His anger, He kept not back their  soul from death, Yea, their life to the pestilence He delivered  up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_51" data-id="PS78_51">And He smiteth every first-born in Egypt, The first-fruit  of the strong in tents of Ham.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS78_52" data-id="PS78_52">And causeth His people to journey as a flock, And guideth  them as a drove in a wilderness,</span>
