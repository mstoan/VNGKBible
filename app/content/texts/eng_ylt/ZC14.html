<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC14_2" data-id="ZC14_2">And I have gathered all the nations unto Jerusalem to  battle, And captured hath been the city, And spoiled have been  the houses, And the women are lain with, Gone forth hath half  the city in a removal, And the remnant of the people are not  cut off from the city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC14_3" data-id="ZC14_3">And gone forth hath Jehovah, And He hath fought against  those nations, As in the day of His fighting in a day of  conflict.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC14_4" data-id="ZC14_4">And stood have His feet, in that day, On the mount of  Olives, That [is] before Jerusalem eastward, And cleft hath  been the mount of Olives at its midst, To the east, and to the  west, a very great valley, And removed hath the half of the  mount towards the north. And its half towards the south.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC14_5" data-id="ZC14_5">And ye have fled [to] the valley of My mountains, For join  doth the valley of the mountains to Azal, And ye have fled as  ye fled before the shaking, In the days of Uzziah king of  Judah, And come in hath Jehovah my God, All holy ones [are]  with Thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC14_6" data-id="ZC14_6">And it hath come to pass, in that day, The precious light  is not, it is dense darkness,</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC14_9" data-id="ZC14_9">And Jehovah hath become king over all the land, In that day  there is one Jehovah, and His name one.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC14_10" data-id="ZC14_10">Changed is all the land as a plain, From Gebo to Rimmon,  south of Jerusalem, And she hath been high, and hath dwelt in  her place, Even from the gate of Benjamin To the place of the  first gate, unto the front gate, And from the tower of  Hananeel, Unto the wine-vats of the king.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC14_11" data-id="ZC14_11">And they have dwelt in her, And destruction is no more,  And Jerusalem hath dwelt confidently.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC14_12" data-id="ZC14_12">And this is the plague with which Jehovah Doth plague all  the peoples who have warred against Jerusalem, He hath consumed  away its flesh, And it is standing on its feet, And its eyes  are consumed in their holes, And its tongue is consumed in  their mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC14_13" data-id="ZC14_13">And it hath come to pass, in that day, A great destruction  [from] Jehovah is among them, And they have seized each the  hand of his neighbour, And gone up hath his hand against the  hand of his neighbour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC14_14" data-id="ZC14_14">And also Judah is fought with in Jerusalem, And gathered  hath been the force of all the nations round about, Gold, and  silver, and apparel, in great abundance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC14_15" data-id="ZC14_15">And so is the plague of the horse, of the mule, Of the  camel, and of the ass, And of all the cattle that are in these  camps, As this plague.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC14_16" data-id="ZC14_16">And it hath come to pass, Every one who hath been left of  all the nations, Who are coming in against Jerusalem, They have  also gone up from year to year, To bow themselves to the King,  Jehovah of Hosts, And to celebrate the feast of the booths.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC14_17" data-id="ZC14_17">And it hath come to pass, That he who doth not go up of  the families of the land unto Jerusalem, To bow himself to the  King, Jehovah of Hosts, Even on them there is no shower.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC14_18" data-id="ZC14_18">And if the family of Egypt go not up, nor come in, Then  not on them is the plague With which Jehovah doth plague the  nations That go not up to celebrate the feast of booths.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC14_19" data-id="ZC14_19">This is the punishment of the sin of Egypt, And the  punishment of the sin of all the nations, That go not up to  celebrate the feast of booths.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC14_20" data-id="ZC14_20">In that day there is on bells of the horse, `Holy to  Jehovah,' And the pots in the house of Jehovah Have been as  bowls before the altar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC14_21" data-id="ZC14_21">And every pot in Jerusalem, and in Judah, Have been holy  to Jehovah of Hosts, And all those sacrificing have come in,  And have taken of them, and boiled in them, And there is no  merchant any more in the house of Jehovah of Hosts in that day!</span>
