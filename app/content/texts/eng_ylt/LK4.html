<div class="c">4</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_1" data-id="LK4_1">And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, turned back from the  Jordan, and was brought in the Spirit to the wilderness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_2" data-id="LK4_2">forty days being tempted by the Devil, and he did not eat  anything in those days, and they having been ended, he  afterward hungered,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_3" data-id="LK4_3">and the Devil said to him, `If Son thou art of God, speak to  this stone that it may become bread.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_4" data-id="LK4_4">And Jesus answered him, saying, `It hath been written, that,  not on bread only shall man live, but on every saying of God.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_5" data-id="LK4_5">And the Devil having brought him up to an high mountain,  shewed to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of  time,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_6" data-id="LK4_6">and the Devil said to him, `To thee I will give all this  authority, and their glory, because to me it hath been  delivered, and to whomsoever I will, I do give it;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_7" data-id="LK4_7">thou, then, if thou mayest bow before me -- all shall be  thine.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_8" data-id="LK4_8">And Jesus answering him said, `Get thee behind me,  Adversary, for it hath been written, Thou shalt bow before the  Lord thy God, and Him only thou shalt serve.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_9" data-id="LK4_9">And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle  of the temple, and said to him, `If the Son thou art of God,  cast thyself down hence,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_10" data-id="LK4_10">for it hath been written -- To His messengers He will give  charge concerning thee, to guard over thee,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_11" data-id="LK4_11">and -- On hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time  thou mayest dash against a stone thy foot.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_12" data-id="LK4_12">And Jesus answering said to him -- `It hath been said, Thou  shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_13" data-id="LK4_13">And having ended all temptation, the Devil departed from  him till a convenient season.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_14" data-id="LK4_14">And Jesus turned back in the power of the Spirit to  Galilee, and a fame went forth through all the region round  about concerning him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_15" data-id="LK4_15">and he was teaching in their synagogues, being glorified by  all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_16" data-id="LK4_16">And he came to Nazareth, where he hath been brought up, and  he went in, according to his custom, on the sabbath-day, to the  synagogue, and stood up to read;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_17" data-id="LK4_17">and there was given over to him a roll of Isaiah the  prophet, and having unfolded the roll, he found the place where  it hath been written:</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_18" data-id="LK4_18">`The Spirit of the Lord [is] upon me, Because He did anoint  me; To proclaim good news to the poor, Sent me to heal the  broken of heart, To proclaim to captives deliverance, And to  blind receiving of sight, To send away the bruised with  deliverance,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_19" data-id="LK4_19">To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_20" data-id="LK4_20">And having folded the roll, having given [it] back to the  officer, he sat down, and the eyes of all in the synagogue were  gazing on him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_21" data-id="LK4_21">And he began to say unto them -- `To-day hath this writing  been fulfilled in your ears;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_22" data-id="LK4_22">and all were bearing testimony to him, and were wondering  at the gracious words that are coming forth out of his mouth,  and they said, `Is not this the son of Joseph?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_23" data-id="LK4_23">And he said unto them, `Certainly ye will say to me this  simile, Physician, heal thyself; as great things as we heard  done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_24" data-id="LK4_24">and he said, `Verily I say to you -- No prophet is accepted  in his own country;</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_25" data-id="LK4_25">and of a truth I say to you, Many widows were in the days  of Elijah, in Israel, when the heaven was shut for three years  and six months, when great famine came on all the land,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_26" data-id="LK4_26">and unto none of them was Elijah sent, but -- to Sarepta of  Sidon, unto a woman, a widow;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_27" data-id="LK4_27">and many lepers were in the time of Elisha the prophet, in  Israel, and none of them was cleansed, but -- Naaman the  Syrian.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_28" data-id="LK4_28">And all in the synagogue were filled with wrath, hearing  these things,</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_29" data-id="LK4_29">and having risen, they put him forth without the city, and  brought him unto the brow of the hill on which their city had  been built -- to cast him down headlong,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_30" data-id="LK4_30">and he, having gone through the midst of them, went away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_31" data-id="LK4_31">And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and was  teaching them on the sabbaths,</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_32" data-id="LK4_32">and they were astonished at his teaching, because his word  was with authority.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_33" data-id="LK4_33">And in the synagogue was a man, having a spirit of an  unclean demon, and he cried out with a great voice,</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_34" data-id="LK4_34">saying, `Away, what -- to us and to thee, Jesus, O  Nazarene? thou didst come to destroy us; I have known thee who  thou art -- the Holy One of God.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_35" data-id="LK4_35">And Jesus did rebuke him, saying, `Be silenced, and come  forth out of him;' and the demon having cast him into the  midst, came forth from him, having hurt him nought;</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_36" data-id="LK4_36">and amazement came upon all, and they were speaking  together, with one another, saying, `What [is] this word, that  with authority and power he doth command the unclean spirits,  and they come forth?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_37" data-id="LK4_37">and there was going forth a fame concerning him to every  place of the region round about.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_38" data-id="LK4_38">And having risen out of the synagogue, he entered into the  house of Simon, and the mother-in-law of Simon was pressed  with a great fever, and they did ask him about her,</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_39" data-id="LK4_39">and having stood over her, he rebuked the fever, and it  left her, and presently, having risen, she was ministering to  them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_40" data-id="LK4_40">And at the setting of the sun, all, as many as had any  ailing with manifold sicknesses, brought them unto him, and he  on each one of them [his] hands having put, did heal them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_41" data-id="LK4_41">And demons also were coming forth from many, crying out and  saying -- `Thou art the Christ, the Son of God;' and rebuking,  he did not suffer them to speak, because they knew him to be  the Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_42" data-id="LK4_42">And day having come, having gone forth, he went on to a  desert place, and the multitudes were seeking him, and they  came unto him, and were staying him -- not to go on from them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_43" data-id="LK4_43">and he said unto them -- `Also to the other cities it  behoveth me to proclaim good news of the reign of God, because  for this I have been sent;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_44" data-id="LK4_44">and he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.</span>
