<div class="c">2</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_1" data-id="EC2_1">I said in my heart, `Pray, come, I try thee with mirth, and  look thou on gladness;' and lo, even it [is] vanity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_2" data-id="EC2_2">Of laughter I said, `Foolish!' and of mirth, `What [is] this  it is doing?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_3" data-id="EC2_3">I have sought in my heart to draw out with wine my appetite,  (and my heart leading in wisdom), and to take hold on folly  till that I see where [is] this -- the good to the sons of man  of that which they do under the heavens, the number of the days  of their lives.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_4" data-id="EC2_4">I made great my works, I builded for me houses, I planted  for me vineyards.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_5" data-id="EC2_5">I made for me gardens and paradises, and I planted in them  trees of every fruit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_6" data-id="EC2_6">I made for me pools of water, to water from them a forest  shooting forth trees.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_7" data-id="EC2_7">I got men-servants, and maid-servants, and sons of the house  were to me; also, I had much substance -- herd and flock --  above all who had been before me in Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_8" data-id="EC2_8">I gathered for me also silver and gold, and the peculiar  treasure of kings and of the provinces. I prepared for me  men-singers and women-singers, and the luxuries of the sons of  man -- a wife and wives.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_9" data-id="EC2_9">And I became great, and increased above every one who had  been before me in Jerusalem; also, my wisdom stood with me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_10" data-id="EC2_10">And all that mine eyes asked I kept not back from them; I  withheld not my heart from any joy, for my heart rejoiced  because of all my labour, and this hath been my portion, from  all my labour,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_11" data-id="EC2_11">and I have looked on all my works that my hands have done,  and on the labour that I have laboured to do, and lo, the whole  [is] vanity and vexation of spirit, and there is no advantage  under the sun!</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_12" data-id="EC2_12">And I turned to see wisdom, and madness, and folly, but  what [is] the man who cometh after the king? that which [is]  already -- they have done it!</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_13" data-id="EC2_13">And I saw that there is an advantage to wisdom  above  folly, like the advantage of the light above  the darkness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_14" data-id="EC2_14">The wise! -- his eyes [are] in his head, and the fool in  darkness is walking, and I also knew that one event happeneth  with them all;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_15" data-id="EC2_15">and I said in my heart, `As it happeneth with the fool, it  happeneth also with me, and why am I then more wise?' And I  spake in my heart, that also this [is] vanity:</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_16" data-id="EC2_16">That there is no remembrance to the wise -- with the fool  -- to the age, for that which [is] already, [in] the days that  are coming is all forgotten, and how dieth the wise? with the  fool!</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_17" data-id="EC2_17">And I have hated life, for sad to me [is] the work that  hath been done under the sun, for the whole [is] vanity and  vexation of spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_18" data-id="EC2_18">And I have hated all my labour that I  labour at under the  sun, because I leave it to a man who is after me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_19" data-id="EC2_19">And who knoweth whether he is wise or foolish? yet he doth  rule over all my labour that I have laboured at, and that I  have done wisely under  the sun! this also [is] vanity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_20" data-id="EC2_20">And I turned round to cause my heart to despair concerning  all the labour that I laboured at under the sun.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_21" data-id="EC2_21">For there is a man whose labour [is] in wisdom, and in  knowledge, and in equity, and to a man who hath not laboured  therein he giveth it -- his portion! Even this [is] vanity and  a great evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_22" data-id="EC2_22">For what hath been to a man by all his labour, and by the  thought of his heart that he laboured at under the sun?</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_23" data-id="EC2_23">For all his days are sorrows, and his travail sadness; even  at night his heart hath not lain down; this also [is] vanity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_24" data-id="EC2_24">There is nothing good in a man who eateth, and hath drunk,  and hath shewn his soul good in his labour. This also I have  seen that it [is] from the hand of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_25" data-id="EC2_25">For who eateth and who hasteth out more than I?</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_26" data-id="EC2_26">For to a man who [is] good before Him, He hath  given  wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; and to a sinner He hath given  travail, to gather and to heap up, to give to the good before  God. Even this [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.</span>
