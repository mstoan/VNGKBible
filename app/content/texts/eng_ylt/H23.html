<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_2" data-id="H23_2">and that we may be delivered from the unreasonable and evil  men, for the faith [is] not of all;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_3" data-id="H23_3">and stedfast is the Lord, who shall establish you, and shall  guard [you] from the evil;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_4" data-id="H23_4">and we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that the  things that we command you ye both do and will do;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_5" data-id="H23_5">and the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God, and to  the endurance of the Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_6" data-id="H23_6">And we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus  Christ, to withdraw yourselves from every brother disorderly  walking, and not after the deliverance that ye received from  us,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_7" data-id="H23_7">for yourselves have known how it behoveth [you] to imitate  us, because we did not act disorderly among you;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_8" data-id="H23_8">nor for nought did we eat bread of any one, but in labour  and in travail, night and day working, not to be chargeable to  any of you;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_9" data-id="H23_9">not because we have not authority, but that ourselves a  pattern we might give to you, to imitate us;</span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_11" data-id="H23_11">for we hear of certain walking among you disorderly,  nothing working, but over working,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_12" data-id="H23_12">and such we command and exhort through our Lord Jesus  Christ, that with quietness working, their own bread they may  eat;</span>
