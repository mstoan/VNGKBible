<div class="c">2</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM2_1" data-id="LM2_1">How doth the Lord cloud in His anger the daughter of Zion,  He hath cast from heaven [to] earth the beauty of Israel, And  hath not remembered His footstool in the day of His anger.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM2_2" data-id="LM2_2">Swallowed up hath the Lord, He hath not pitied any of the  pleasant places of Jacob, He hath broken down in His wrath The  fortresses of the daughter of Judah, He hath caused to come to  the earth, He polluted the kingdom and its princes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM2_3" data-id="LM2_3">He hath cut off in the heat of anger every horn of Israel,  He hath turned backward His right hand From the face of the  enemy, And He burneth against Jacob as a flaming fire, It hath  devoured round about.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM2_4" data-id="LM2_4">He hath trodden His bow as an enemy, Stood hath His right  hand as an adversary, And He slayeth all the desirable ones of  the eye, In the tent of the daughter of Zion, He hath poured  out as fire His fury.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM2_5" data-id="LM2_5">The Lord hath been as an enemy, He hath swallowed up Israel,  He hath swallowed up all her palaces, He hath destroyed His  fortresses, And He multiplieth in the daughter of Judah  Mourning and moaning.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM2_6" data-id="LM2_6">And He shaketh as a garden His tabernacle, He hath destroyed  His appointed place, Jehovah hath forgotten in Zion the  appointed time and sabbath, And despiseth, in the indignation  of His anger, king and priest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM2_7" data-id="LM2_7">The Lord hath cast off His altar, He hath rejected His  sanctuary, He hath shut up into the hand of the enemy The walls  of her palaces, A noise they have made in the house of Jehovah  Like a day of appointment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM2_8" data-id="LM2_8">Devised hath Jehovah to destroy the wall of the daughter of  Zion, He hath stretched out a line, He hath not turned His hand  from destroying, And He causeth bulwark and wall to mourn,  Together -- they have been weak.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM2_9" data-id="LM2_9">Sunk into the earth have her gates, He hath destroyed and  broken her bars, Her king and her princes [are] among the  nations, There is no law, also her prophets Have not found  vision from Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM2_10" data-id="LM2_10">Sit on the earth -- keep silent do the elders of the  daughter of Zion, They have caused dust to go up on their head,  They have girded on sackcloth, Put down to the earth their head  have the virgins of Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM2_11" data-id="LM2_11">Consumed by tears have been my eyes, Troubled have been my  bowels, Poured out to the earth hath been my liver, For the  breach of the daughter of my people; In infant and suckling  being feeble, In the broad places of the city,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM2_12" data-id="LM2_12">To their mothers they say, `Where [are] corn and wine?' In  their becoming feeble as a pierced one In the broad places of  the city, In their soul pouring itself out into the bosom of  their mothers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM2_13" data-id="LM2_13">What do I testify [to] thee, what do I liken to thee, O  daughter of Jerusalem? What do I equal to thee, and I comfort  thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? For great as a sea [is] thy  breach, Who doth give healing to thee?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM2_14" data-id="LM2_14">Thy prophets have seen for thee a false and insipid thing,  And have not revealed concerning thine iniquity, To turn back  thy captivity, And they see for thee false burdens and causes  of expulsion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM2_15" data-id="LM2_15">Clapped hands at thee have all passing by the way, They  have hissed -- and they shake the head At the daughter of  Jerusalem: `Is this the city of which they said: The perfection  of beauty, a joy to all the land?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM2_16" data-id="LM2_16">Opened against thee their mouth have all thine enemies,  They have hissed, yea, they gnash the teeth, They have said:  `We have swallowed [her] up, Surely this [is] the day that we  looked for, We have found -- we have seen.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM2_17" data-id="LM2_17">Jehovah hath done that which He devised, He hath fulfilled  His saying That He commanded from the days of old, He hath  broken down and hath not pitied, And causeth an enemy to  rejoice over thee, He lifted up the horn of thine adversaries.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM2_18" data-id="LM2_18">Cried hath their heart unto the Lord; O wall of the  daughter of Zion, Cause to go down as a stream tears daily and  nightly, Give not rest to thyself, Let not the daughter of  thine eye stand still.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM2_19" data-id="LM2_19">Arise, cry aloud in the night, At the beginning of the  watches. Pour out as water thy heart, Over against the face of  the Lord, Lift up unto Him thy hands, for the soul of thine  infants, Who are feeble with hunger at the head of all  out-places.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM2_20" data-id="LM2_20">See, O Jehovah, and look attentively, To whom Thou hast  acted thus, Do women eat their fruit, infants of a handbreadth?  Slain in the sanctuary of the Lord are priest and prophet?</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM2_21" data-id="LM2_21">Lain on the earth [in] out-places have young and old, My  virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword, Thou hast  slain in a day of Thine anger, Thou hast slaughtered -- Thou  hast not pitied.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LM2_22" data-id="LM2_22">Thou dost call as [at] a day of appointment, My fears from  round about, And there hath not been in the day of the anger of  Jehovah, An escaped and remaining one, They whom I stretched  out and nourished, My enemy hath consumed!</span>
