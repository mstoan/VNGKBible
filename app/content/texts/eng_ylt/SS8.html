<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS8_2" data-id="SS8_2">I lead thee, I bring thee in unto my mother's house, She  doth teach me, I cause thee to drink of the perfumed wine, Of  the juice of my pomegranate,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS8_3" data-id="SS8_3">His left hand [is] under my head, And his right doth embrace  me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS8_4" data-id="SS8_4">I have adjured you, daughters of Jerusalem, How ye stir up,  And how ye wake the love till she please!</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS8_5" data-id="SS8_5">Who [is] this coming from the wilderness, Hasting herself  for her beloved? Under the citron-tree I have waked thee, There  did thy mother pledge thee, There she gave a pledge [that] bare  thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS8_6" data-id="SS8_6">Set me as a seal on thy heart, as a seal on thine arm, For  strong as death is love, Sharp as Sheol is jealousy, Its  burnings [are] burnings of fire, a flame of Jah!</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS8_7" data-id="SS8_7">Many waters are not able to quench the love, And floods do  not wash it away. If one give all the wealth of his house for  love, Treading down -- they tread upon it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS8_8" data-id="SS8_8">We have a little sister, and breasts she hath not, What do  we do for our sister, In the day that it is told of her?</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS8_9" data-id="SS8_9">If she is a wall, we build by her a palace of silver. And if  she is a door, We fashion by her board-work of cedar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS8_10" data-id="SS8_10">I [am] a wall, and my breasts as towers, Then I have been  in his eyes as one finding peace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS8_11" data-id="SS8_11">Solomon hath a vineyard in Baal-Hamon, He hath given the  vineyard to keepers, Each bringeth for its fruit a thousand  silverlings;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS8_12" data-id="SS8_12">My vineyard -- my own -- is before me, The thousand [is]  for thee, O Solomon. And the two hundred for those keeping its  fruit. O dweller in gardens!</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS8_13" data-id="SS8_13">The companions are attending to thy voice, Cause me to  hear. Flee, my beloved, and be like to a roe,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS8_14" data-id="SS8_14">Or to a young one of the harts on mountains of spices!</span>
