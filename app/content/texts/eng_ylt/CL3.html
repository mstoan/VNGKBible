<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_2" data-id="CL3_2">the things above mind ye, not the things upon the earth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_3" data-id="CL3_3">for ye did die, and your life hath been hid with the Christ  in God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_4" data-id="CL3_4">when the Christ -- our life -- may be manifested, then also  we with him shall be manifested in glory.</span>
