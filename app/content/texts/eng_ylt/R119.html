<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R119_7" data-id="R119_7">and they hire to them two and thirty thousand chariots, and  the king of Maachah and his people, and they come in and encamp  before Medeba, and the sons of Ammon have been gathered out of  their cities, and come in to the battle.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R119_8" data-id="R119_8">And David heareth, and sendeth Joab, and all the host of  the mighty men,</span>
