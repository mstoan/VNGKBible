<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S26_3" data-id="S26_3">And they cause the ark of God to ride on a new cart, and  lift it up from the house of Abinadab, which [is] in the  height, and Uzzah and Ahio sons of Abinadab are leading the new  cart;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S26_4" data-id="S26_4">and they lift it up from the house of Abinadab, which [is]  in the height, with the ark of God, and Ahio is going before  the ark,</span>

<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S26_6" data-id="S26_6">And they come unto the threshing-floor of Nachon, and Uzzah  putteth forth [his hand] unto the ark of God, and layeth hold  on it, for they released the oxen;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S26_7" data-id="S26_7">and the anger of Jehovah burneth against Uzzah, and God  smiteth him there for the error, and he dieth there by the ark  of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S26_8" data-id="S26_8">And it is displeasing to David, because that Jehovah hath  broken forth a breach upon Uzzah, and [one] calleth that place  Perez-Uzzah, unto this day;</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S26_17" data-id="S26_17">And they bring in the ark of Jehovah, and set it up in its  place, in the midst of the tent which David hath spread out for  it, and David causeth to ascend burnt-offerings before Jehovah,  and peace-offerings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v S26_18" data-id="S26_18">And David finisheth from causing to ascend the  burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings, and blesseth the  people in the name of Jehovah of Hosts,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v S26_19" data-id="S26_19">and he apportioneth to all the people, to all the multitude  of Israel, from man even unto woman, to each, one cake of  bread, and one eshpar, and one ashisha, and all the people go,  each to his house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v S26_20" data-id="S26_20">And David turneth back to bless his house, and Michal  daughter of Saul goeth out to meet David, and saith, `How  honourable to-day was the king of Israel, who was uncovered  to-day before the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one  of the vain ones is openly uncovered!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v S26_21" data-id="S26_21">And David saith unto Michal, `-- Before Jehovah, who fixed  on me above thy father, and above all his house, to appoint me  leader over the people of Jehovah, and over Israel, -- yea, I  played before Jehovah;</span>
