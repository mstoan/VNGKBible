<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_2" data-id="EK15_2">`Son of man, What is the vine-tree more than any tree? The  vine-branch that hath been, Among trees of the forest?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_3" data-id="EK15_3">Is wood taken from it to use for work? Do they take of it a  pin to hang any vessel on it?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_4" data-id="EK15_4">Lo, to the fire it hath been given for fuel, Its two ends  hath the fire eaten, And its midst hath been scorched! Is it  profitable for work?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_5" data-id="EK15_5">Lo, in its being perfect it is not used for work, How much  less, when fire hath eaten of it, And it is scorched, Hath it  been used yet for work?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_6" data-id="EK15_6">Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: As the vine-tree  among trees of the forest, That I have given to the fire for  fuel, So I have given the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_7" data-id="EK15_7">And I have set My face against them, From the fire they  have gone forth, And the fire doth consume them, And ye have  known that I [am] Jehovah, In My setting My face against them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_8" data-id="EK15_8">And I have made the land a desolation, Because they have  committed a trespass, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah!'</span>
