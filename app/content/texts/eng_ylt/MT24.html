<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT24_2" data-id="MT24_2">and Jesus said to them, `Do ye not see all these? verily I  say to you, There may not be left here a stone upon a stone,  that shall not be thrown down.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT24_3" data-id="MT24_3">And when he is sitting on the mount of the Olives, the  disciples came near to him by himself, saying, `Tell us, when  shall these be? and what [is] the sign of thy presence, and of  the full end of the age?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT24_4" data-id="MT24_4">And Jesus answering said to them, `Take heed that no one  may lead you astray,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT24_5" data-id="MT24_5">for many shall come in my name, saying, I am the Christ,  and they shall lead many astray,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT24_6" data-id="MT24_6">and ye shall begin to hear of wars, and reports of wars;  see, be not troubled, for it behoveth all [these] to come to  pass, but the end is not yet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT24_7" data-id="MT24_7">`For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against  kingdom, and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and  earthquakes, in divers places;</span>
