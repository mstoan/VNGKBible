<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK5_2" data-id="EK5_2">A third part with fire thou dost burn in the midst of the  city, at the fulness of the days of the siege; and thou hast  taken the third part, thou dost smite with a weapon round about  it; and the third part thou dost scatter to the wind, and a  weapon I draw out after them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK5_3" data-id="EK5_3">And thou hast taken thence a few in number -- and hast bound  them in thy skirts;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK5_4" data-id="EK5_4">and of them thou dost take again, and hast cast them unto  the midst of the fire, and hast burned them in the fire -- out  of it cometh forth a fire unto all the house of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK5_5" data-id="EK5_5">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: this [is] Jerusalem, In the  midst of the nations I have set her, And round about her [are]  the lands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK5_6" data-id="EK5_6">And she changeth My judgments into wickedness more than the  nations, And My statutes more than the lands that [are] round  about her, For against My judgments they have kicked, And My  statutes -- they have not walked in them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK5_7" data-id="EK5_7">Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of your  multiplying above the nations that [are] around you, In My  statutes ye have not walked, And My judgments ye have not done,  According to the judgments of the nations That [are] round about  you ye have not done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK5_8" data-id="EK5_8">Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I [am] against  thee, even I, And I have done in thy midst judgments, Before  the eyes of the nations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK5_9" data-id="EK5_9">And I have done in thee that which I have not done, And that  which I do not its like again, Because of all thine  abominations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK5_10" data-id="EK5_10">Therefore fathers do eat sons in thy midst, And sons eat  their fathers, And I have done in thee judgments, And have  scattered all thy remnant to every wind.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK5_11" data-id="EK5_11">Therefore, I live -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah:  Because My sanctuary thou hast defiled, With all thy detestable  things, And with all thine abominations, Mine eye pitieth not,  and I also spare not. Do not even I also diminish?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK5_12" data-id="EK5_12">Thy third part -- by pestilence they die, And by famine are  consumed in thy midst, And the third part, by sword they fall  round about thee, And the third part, to every wind I scatter,  And a sword I draw out after them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK5_13" data-id="EK5_13">And completed hath been Mine anger, And I have caused My  fury to rest on them, And I have been comforted, And they have  known that I, Jehovah, have spoken in My zeal, In My completing  My fury on them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK5_14" data-id="EK5_14">And I give thee for a waste, And for a reproach among  nations that [are] round about thee, Before the eyes of every  passer by.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK5_15" data-id="EK5_15">And it hath been a reproach and a reviling, An instruction  and an astonishment, To nations that [are] round about thee, In  My doing in thee judgments, In anger and fury, and in furious  reproofs, I, Jehovah, have spoken.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK5_16" data-id="EK5_16">In My sending the evil arrows of famine among them, That  have been for destruction, That I send to destroy you, And  famine I am adding upon you, And I have broken to you the staff  of bread.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK5_17" data-id="EK5_17">And I have sent on you famine and evil beasts, And they  have bereaved thee, And pestilence and blood pass over on thee,  And a sword I do bring in against thee, I, Jehovah, have  spoken!'</span>
