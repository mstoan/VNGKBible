<div class="c">15</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_1" data-id="LK15_1">And all the tax-gatherers and the sinners were coming nigh  to him, to hear him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_2" data-id="LK15_2">and the Pharisees and the scribes were murmuring, saying --  This one doth receive sinners, and doth eat with them.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_3" data-id="LK15_3">And he spake unto them this simile, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_4" data-id="LK15_4">`What man of you having a hundred sheep, and having lost  one out of them, doth not leave behind the ninety-nine in the  wilderness, and go on after the lost one, till he may find it?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_5" data-id="LK15_5">and having found, he doth lay [it] on his shoulders  rejoicing,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_6" data-id="LK15_6">and having come to the house, he doth call together the  friends and the neighbours, saying to them, Rejoice with me,  because I found my sheep -- the lost one.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_7" data-id="LK15_7">`I say to you, that so joy shall be in the heaven over one  sinner reforming, rather than over ninety-nine righteous men,  who have no need of reformation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_8" data-id="LK15_8">`Or what woman having ten drachms, if she may lose one  drachm, doth not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek  carefully till that she may find?</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_9" data-id="LK15_9">and having found, she doth call together the female friends  and the neighbours, saying, Rejoice with me, for I found the  drachm that I lost.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_10" data-id="LK15_10">`So I say to you, joy doth come before the messengers of  God over one sinner reforming.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_11" data-id="LK15_11">And he said, `A certain man had two sons,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_12" data-id="LK15_12">and the younger of them said to the father, Father, give  me the portion of the substance falling to [me], and he  divided to them the living.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_13" data-id="LK15_13">`And not many days after, having gathered all together,  the younger son went abroad to a far country, and there he  scattered his substance, living riotously;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_14" data-id="LK15_14">and he having spent all, there came a mighty famine on  that country, and himself began to be in want;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_15" data-id="LK15_15">and having gone on, he joined himself to one of the  citizens of that country, and he sent him to the fields to feed  swine,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_16" data-id="LK15_16">and he was desirous to fill his belly from the husks that  the swine were eating, and no one was giving to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_17" data-id="LK15_17">`And having come to himself, he said, How many hirelings  of my father have a superabundance of bread, and I here with  hunger am perishing!</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_18" data-id="LK15_18">having risen, I will go on unto my father, and will say to  him, Father, I did sin -- to the heaven, and before thee,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_19" data-id="LK15_19">and no more am I worthy to be called thy son; make me as  one of thy hirelings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_20" data-id="LK15_20">`And having risen, he went unto his own father, and he  being yet far distant, his father saw him, and was moved with  compassion, and having ran he fell upon his neck and kissed  him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_21" data-id="LK15_21">and the son said to him, Father, I did sin -- to the  heaven, and before thee, and no more am I worthy to be called  thy son.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_22" data-id="LK15_22">`And the father said unto his servants, Bring forth the  first robe, and clothe him, and give a ring for his hand, and  sandals for the feet;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_23" data-id="LK15_23">and having brought the fatted calf, kill [it], and having  eaten, we may be merry,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_24" data-id="LK15_24">because this my son was dead, and did live again, and he  was lost, and was found; and they began to be merry.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_25" data-id="LK15_25">`And his elder son was in a field, and as, coming, he drew  nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_26" data-id="LK15_26">and having called near one of the young men, he was  inquiring what these things might be,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_27" data-id="LK15_27">and he said to him -- Thy brother is arrived, and thy  father did kill the fatted calf, because in health he did  receive him back.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_28" data-id="LK15_28">`And he was angry, and would not go in, therefore his  father, having come forth, was entreating him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_29" data-id="LK15_29">and he answering said to the father, Lo, so many years I  do serve thee, and never thy command did I transgress, and to  me thou didst never give a kid, that with my friends I might  make merry;</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_30" data-id="LK15_30">but when thy son -- this one who did devour thy living  with harlots -- came, thou didst kill to him the fatted calf.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_31" data-id="LK15_31">`And he said to him, Child, thou art always with me, and  all my things are thine;</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK15_32" data-id="LK15_32">but to be merry, and to be glad, it was needful, because  this thy brother was dead, and did live again, he was lost,  and was found.'</span>
