<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_2" data-id="IS48_2">For from the Holy City they have been called, And on the  God of Israel been supported, Jehovah of Hosts [is] His name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_3" data-id="IS48_3">The former things from that time I declared, And from my  mouth they have gone forth, And I proclaim them, Suddenly I  have done, and it cometh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_4" data-id="IS48_4">From my knowing that thou art obstinate, And a sinew of  iron thy neck, And thy forehead brass,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_5" data-id="IS48_5">And I declare to thee from that time, Before it cometh I  have caused thee to hear, Lest thou say, `Mine idol hath done  them, And my graven image, And my molten image did command  them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_6" data-id="IS48_6">Thou hast heard, see the whole of it, And ye, do ye not  declare? I have caused thee to hear new things from this time,  And things reserved that ye knew not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_7" data-id="IS48_7">Now they have been produced and not from that time, Yea,  before the day, and thou hast not heard them, Lest thou say,  `Lo, I have known them.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_8" data-id="IS48_8">Yea, thou hast not heard, Yea, thou hast not known, Yea,  from that time not opened hath thine ear, For I have known thou  dealest treacherously, And `Transgressor from the belly,' One  is crying to thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_9" data-id="IS48_9">For My name's sake I defer Mine anger, And My praise I  restrain for thee, So as not to cut thee off.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_10" data-id="IS48_10">Lo, I have refined thee, and not with silver, I have  chosen thee in a furnace of affliction.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_11" data-id="IS48_11">For My sake, for Mine own sake, I do [it], For how is it  polluted? And Mine honour to another I give not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_12" data-id="IS48_12">Hearken to me, O Jacob, and Israel, My called one, I [am]  He, I [am] first, and I [am] last;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_13" data-id="IS48_13">Also, My hand hath founded earth, And My right hand  stretched out the heavens, I am calling unto them, they stand  together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_14" data-id="IS48_14">Be gathered all of you, and hear, Who among them did  declare these things? Jehovah hath loved him, He doth His  pleasure on Babylon, And His arm [is on] the Chaldeans.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_15" data-id="IS48_15">I -- I have spoken, yea, I have called him, I have brought  him in, And he hath made prosperous his way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_16" data-id="IS48_16">Come ye near unto me, hear this, Not from the beginning in  secret spake I, From the time of its being, there [am] I, And  now the Lord Jehovah hath sent me, and His Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_17" data-id="IS48_17">Thus said Jehovah, thy redeemer, The Holy One of Israel,  `I [am] Jehovah thy God, teaching thee to profit, Causing thee  to tread in the way thou goest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_18" data-id="IS48_18">O that thou hadst attended to My commands, Then as a river  is thy peace, And thy righteousness as billows of the sea,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_19" data-id="IS48_19">And as sand is thy seed, And the offspring of thy bowels  as its gravel, Not cut off nor destroyed his name before Me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_20" data-id="IS48_20">Go out from Babylon, flee from the Chaldeans, With a voice  of singing declare, Cause ye this to be heard, Bring it forth  unto the end of the earth, Say, Redeemed hath Jehovah His  servant Jacob.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_21" data-id="IS48_21">And they have not thirsted in waste places, He hath caused  them to go on, Waters from a rock he hath caused to flow to  them, Yea, he cleaveth a rock, and flow do waters.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS48_22" data-id="IS48_22">There is no peace, said Jehovah, to the wicked!</span>
