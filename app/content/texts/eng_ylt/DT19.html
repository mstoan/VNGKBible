<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_2" data-id="DT19_2">three cities thou dost separate for thee in the midst of  thy land which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee to possess it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_3" data-id="DT19_3">Thou dost prepare for thee the way, and hast divided into  three parts the border of thy land which Jehovah thy God doth  cause thee to inherit, and it hath been for the fleeing thither  of every man-slayer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_4" data-id="DT19_4">`And this [is] the matter of the man-slayer who fleeth  thither, and hath lived: He who smiteth his neighbour  unknowingly, and is not hating him heretofore,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_5" data-id="DT19_5">even he who cometh in with his neighbour into a forest to  hew wood, and his hand hath driven with an axe to cut the tree,  and the iron hath slipped from the wood, and hath met his  neighbour, and he hath died -- he doth flee unto one of these  cities, and hath lived,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_6" data-id="DT19_6">lest the redeemer of blood pursue after the man-slayer when  his heart is hot, and hath overtaken him (because the way is  great), and hath smitten him -- the life, and he hath no  sentence of death, for he is not hating him heretofore;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_7" data-id="DT19_7">therefore I am commanding thee, saying, Three cities thou  dost separate to thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_8" data-id="DT19_8">`And if Jehovah thy God doth enlarge thy border, as He hath  sworn to thy fathers, and hath given to thee all the land which  He hath spoken to give to thy fathers --</span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_10" data-id="DT19_10">and innocent blood is not shed in the midst of thy land  which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee -- an inheritance, and  there hath been upon thee blood.</span>
