<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_2" data-id="T15_2">aged women as mothers, younger ones as sisters -- in all  purity;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_3" data-id="T15_3">honour widows who are really widows;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_4" data-id="T15_4">and if any widow have children or grandchildren, let them  learn first to their own house to show piety, and to give back  a recompense to the parents, for this is right and acceptable  before God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_5" data-id="T15_5">And she who is really a widow and desolate, hath hoped upon  God, and doth remain in the supplications and in the prayers  night and day,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_6" data-id="T15_6">and she who is given to luxury, living -- hath died;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_7" data-id="T15_7">and these things charge, that they may be blameless;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_8" data-id="T15_8">and if any one for his own -- and especially for those of  the household -- doth not provide, the faith he hath denied,  and than an unbeliever he is worse.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_9" data-id="T15_9">A widow -- let her not be enrolled under sixty years of age,  having been a wife of one husband,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_10" data-id="T15_10">in good works being testified to: if she brought up  children, if she entertained strangers, if saints' feet she  washed, if those in tribulation she relieved, if every good  work she followed after;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_11" data-id="T15_11">and younger widows be refusing, for when they may revel  against the Christ, they wish to marry,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_12" data-id="T15_12">having judgment, because the first faith they did cast  away,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_13" data-id="T15_13">and at the same time also, they learn [to be] idle, going  about the houses; and not only idle, but also tattlers and  busybodies, speaking the things they ought not;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_14" data-id="T15_14">I wish, therefore, younger ones to marry, to bear children,  to be mistress of the house, to give no occasion to the  opposer to reviling;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_15" data-id="T15_15">for already certain did turn aside after the Adversary.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_16" data-id="T15_16">If any believing man or believing woman have widows, let  them relieve them, and let not the assembly be burdened, that  those really widows it may relieve.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_17" data-id="T15_17">The well-leading elders of double honour let them be  counted worthy, especially those labouring in word and  teaching,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_18" data-id="T15_18">for the Writing saith, `An ox treading out thou shalt not  muzzle,' and `Worthy [is] the workman of his reward.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_19" data-id="T15_19">Against an elder an accusation receive not, except upon two  or three witnesses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_20" data-id="T15_20">Those sinning, reprove before all, that the others also may  have fear;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_21" data-id="T15_21">I testify fully, before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and  the choice messengers, that these things thou mayest keep,  without forejudging, doing nothing by partiality.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_22" data-id="T15_22">Be laying hands quickly on no one, nor be having fellowship  with sins of others; be keeping thyself pure;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_23" data-id="T15_23">no longer be drinking water, but a little wine be using,  because of thy stomach and of thine often infirmities;</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_24" data-id="T15_24">of certain men the sins are manifest beforehand, leading  before to judgment, and certain also they follow after;</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v T15_25" data-id="T15_25">in like manner also the right works are manifest  beforehand, and those that are otherwise are not able to be  hid.</span>
