<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_2" data-id="T23_2">for men shall be lovers of themselves, lovers of money,  boasters, proud, evil-speakers, to parents disobedient,  unthankful, unkind,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_3" data-id="T23_3">without natural affection, implacable, false accusers,  incontinent, fierce, not lovers of those who are good,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_4" data-id="T23_4">traitors, heady, lofty, lovers of pleasure more than lovers  of God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_5" data-id="T23_5">having a form of piety, and its power having denied; and  from these be turning away,</span>
