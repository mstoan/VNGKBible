<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_2" data-id="JG14_2">and cometh up and declareth to his father, and to his  mother, and saith, `A woman I have seen in Timnath, of the  daughters of the Philistines; and now, take her for me for a  wife.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_3" data-id="JG14_3">And his father saith to him -- also his mother, `Is there not  among the daughters of thy brethren, and among all my people, a  woman, that thou art going to take a woman from the  uncircumcised Philistines?' and Samson saith unto his father,  `Take her for me, for she is right in mine eyes.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_4" data-id="JG14_4">And his father and his mother have not known that from  Jehovah it [is], that a meeting he is seeking of the  Philistines; and at that time the Philistines are ruling over  Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_5" data-id="JG14_5">And Samson goeth down -- also his father and his mother, to  Timnath, and they come unto the vineyards of Timnath, and lo, a  lion's whelp roareth at meeting him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_6" data-id="JG14_6">and the Spirit of Jehovah prospereth over him, and he  rendeth it as the rending of a kid, and there is nothing in his  hand, and he hath not declared to his father and to his mother  that which he hath done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_7" data-id="JG14_7">And he goeth down and speaketh to the woman, and she is  right in the eyes of Samson;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_8" data-id="JG14_8">and he turneth back after [some] days to take her, and  turneth aside to see the carcase of the lion, and lo, a company  of bees [are] in the body of the lion -- and honey.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_9" data-id="JG14_9">And he taketh it down on to his hands, and goeth on, going  and eating; and he goeth unto his father, and unto his mother,  and giveth to them, and they eat, and he hath not declared to  them that from the body of the lion he took down the honey.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_10" data-id="JG14_10">And his father goeth down unto the woman, and Samson  maketh there a banquet, for so the young men do;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_11" data-id="JG14_11">and it cometh to pass when they see him, that they take  thirty companions, and they are with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_12" data-id="JG14_12">And Samson saith to them, `Let me, I pray you, put forth  to you a riddle; if ye certainly declare it to me [in] the  seven days of the banquet, and have found [it] out, then I have  given to you thirty linen shirts, and thirty changes of  garments;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_13" data-id="JG14_13">and if ye are not able to declare [it] to me, then ye have  given to me thirty linen shirts, and thirty changes of  garments.' And they say to him, `Put forth thy riddle, and we  hear it!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_14" data-id="JG14_14">And he saith to them: `Out of the eater came forth meat,  And out of the strong came forth sweetness;' and they were not  able to declare the riddle [in] three days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_15" data-id="JG14_15">And it cometh to pass, on the seventh day, that they say  to Samson's wife, `Entice thy husband, that he declare to us  the riddle, lest we burn thee and the house of thy father with  fire; to possess us have ye called for us? is it not?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_16" data-id="JG14_16">And Samson's wife weepeth for it, and saith, `Thou hast  only hated me, and hast not loved me; the riddle thou hast put  forth to the sons of my people -- and to me thou hast not  declared it;' and he saith to her, `Lo, to my father and to my  mother I have not declared [it] -- and to thee I declare [it]!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_17" data-id="JG14_17">And she weepeth for it the seven days [in] which their  banquet hath been, and it cometh to pass on the seventh day  that he declareth [it] to her, for she hath distressed him; and  she declareth the riddle to the sons of her people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_18" data-id="JG14_18">And the men of the city say to him on the seventh day,  before the sun goeth in: -- `What [is] sweeter than honey? And  what stronger than a lion?' And he saith to them: `Unless ye  had ploughed with my heifer, Ye had not found out my riddle.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_19" data-id="JG14_19">And the Spirit of Jehovah prospereth over him, and he  goeth down to Ashkelon, and smiteth of them thirty men, and  taketh their armour, and giveth the changes to those declaring  the riddle; and his anger burneth, and he goeth up to the house  of his father;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_20" data-id="JG14_20">and Samson's wife becometh his companion's, who [is] his  friend.</span>
