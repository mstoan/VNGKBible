<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_2" data-id="JB34_2">Hear, O wise men, my words, And, O knowing ones, give ear  to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_3" data-id="JB34_3">For the ear doth try words, And the palate tasteth to eat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_4" data-id="JB34_4">Judgment let us choose for ourselves, Let us know among  ourselves what [is] good.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_5" data-id="JB34_5">For Job hath said, `I have been righteous, And God hath  turned aside my right,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_6" data-id="JB34_6">Against my right do I lie? Mortal [is] mine arrow --  without transgression.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_7" data-id="JB34_7">Who [is] a man like Job? He drinketh scoffing like water,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_8" data-id="JB34_8">And he hath travelled for company With workers of iniquity,  So as to go with men of wickedness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_9" data-id="JB34_9">For he hath said, `It doth not profit a man, When he  delighteth himself with God.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_10" data-id="JB34_10">Therefore, O men of heart, hearken to me; Far be it from  God to do wickedness, And [from] the Mighty to do perverseness:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_11" data-id="JB34_11">For the work of man he repayeth to him, And according to  the path of each He doth cause him to find.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_12" data-id="JB34_12">Yea, truly, God doth not do wickedly, And the Mighty doth  not pervert judgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_13" data-id="JB34_13">Who hath inspected for Himself the earth? And who hath  placed all the habitable world?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_14" data-id="JB34_14">If He doth set on him His heart, His spirit and his breath  unto Him He gathereth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_15" data-id="JB34_15">Expire doth all flesh together, And man to dust returneth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_16" data-id="JB34_16">And if [there is] understanding, hear this, Give ear to  the voice of my words.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_17" data-id="JB34_17">Yea, doth one hating justice govern? Or the Most Just dost  thou condemn?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_18" data-id="JB34_18">Who hath said to a king -- `Worthless,' Unto princes --  `Wicked?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_19" data-id="JB34_19">That hath not accepted the person of princes, Nor hath  known the rich before the poor, For a work of His hands [are]  all of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_20" data-id="JB34_20">[In] a moment they die, and at midnight Shake do people,  and they pass away, And they remove the mighty without hand.</span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_22" data-id="JB34_22">There is no darkness nor death-shade, For workers of  iniquity to be hidden there;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_23" data-id="JB34_23">For He doth not suffer man any more, To go unto God in  judgment,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_24" data-id="JB34_24">He breaketh the mighty -- no searching! And He appointeth  others in their stead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_25" data-id="JB34_25">Therefore He knoweth their works, And He hath overturned  by night, And they are bruised.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_26" data-id="JB34_26">As wicked He hath stricken them, In the place of  beholders.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_27" data-id="JB34_27">Because that against right They have turned aside from  after Him, And none of His ways have considered wisely,</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_28" data-id="JB34_28">To cause to come in unto Him The cry of the poor, And the  cry of the afflicted He heareth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_29" data-id="JB34_29">And He giveth rest, and who maketh wrong? And hideth the  face, and who beholdeth it? And in reference to a nation and to  a man, [It is] the same.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_30" data-id="JB34_30">From the reigning of a profane man, From the snares of a  people;</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_31" data-id="JB34_31">For unto God hath any said: `I have taken away, I do not  corruptly,</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_32" data-id="JB34_32">Besides [that which] I see, shew Thou me, If iniquity I  have done -- I do not add?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_33" data-id="JB34_33">By thee doth He recompense, That thou hast refused -- That  thou dost choose, and not I? And what thou hast known, speak.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_34" data-id="JB34_34">Let men of heart say to me, And a wise man is hearkening  to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_35" data-id="JB34_35">Job -- not with knowledge doth he speak, And his words  [are] not with wisdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_36" data-id="JB34_36">My Father! let Job be tried -- unto victory, Because of  answers for men of iniquity,</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB34_37" data-id="JB34_37">For he doth add to his sin, Transgression among us he  vomiteth, And multiplieth his sayings to God.</span>
