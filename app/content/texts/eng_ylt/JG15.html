<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_2" data-id="JG15_2">and her father saith, I certainly said, that thou didst  certainly hate her, and I give her to thy companion; is not her  sister -- the young one -- better than she? Let her be, I pray  thee, to thee, instead of her.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_3" data-id="JG15_3">And Samson saith of them, `I am more innocent this time  than the Philistines, though I am doing with them evil.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_4" data-id="JG15_4">And Samson goeth and catcheth three hundred foxes, and  taketh torches, and turneth tail unto tail, and putteth a torch  between the two tails, in the midst,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_5" data-id="JG15_5">and kindleth fire in the torches, and sendeth [them] out  into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burneth [it]  from heap even unto standing corn, even unto  vineyard -- olive-yard.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_6" data-id="JG15_6">And the Philistines say, `Who hath done this?' And they  say, `Samson, son-in-law of the Timnite, because he hath taken  away his wife, and giveth her to his companion;' and the  Philistines go up, and burn her and her father with fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_7" data-id="JG15_7">And Samson saith to them, `Though ye do thus, nevertheless  I am avenged on you, and afterwards I cease!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_8" data-id="JG15_8">And he smiteth them hip and thigh -- a great smiting, and  goeth down and dwelleth in the cleft of the rock Etam.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_9" data-id="JG15_9">And the Philistines go up, and encamp in Judah, and are  spread out in Lehi,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_10" data-id="JG15_10">and the men of Judah say, `Why have ye come up against  us?' and they say, `To bind Samson we have come up, to do to  him as he hath done to us.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_11" data-id="JG15_11">And three thousand men of Judah go down unto the cleft of  the rock Etam, and say to Samson, `Hast thou now known that the  Philistines are rulers over us? and what [is] this thou hast  done to us?' And he saith to them, `As they did to me, so I did  to them.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_12" data-id="JG15_12">And they say to him, `To bind thee we have come down -- to  give thee into the hand of the Philistines.' And Samson saith  to them, `Swear to me, lest ye fall upon me yourselves.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_13" data-id="JG15_13">And they speak to him, saying, No, but we certainly bind  thee, and have given thee into their hand, and we certainly do  not put thee to death;' and they bind him with two thick bands,  new ones, and bring him up from the rock.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_14" data-id="JG15_14">He hath come unto Lehi -- and the Philistines have shouted  at meeting him -- and the Spirit of Jehovah prospereth over him,  and the thick bands which [are] on his arms are as flax which  they burn with fire, and his bands are wasted from off his  hands,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_15" data-id="JG15_15">and he findeth a fresh jaw-bone of an ass, and putteth  forth his hand and taketh it, and smiteth with it -- a thousand  men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_16" data-id="JG15_16">And Samson saith, `With a jaw-bone of the ass -- an ass  upon asses -- with a jaw-bone of the ass I have smitten a  thousand men.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_17" data-id="JG15_17">And it cometh to pass when he finisheth speaking, that he  casteth away the jaw-bone out of his hand, and calleth that  place Ramath-Lehi;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_18" data-id="JG15_18">and he thirsteth exceedingly, and calleth unto Jehovah,  and saith, `Thou -- Thou hast given by the hand of Thy servant  this great salvation; and now, I die with thirst, and have  fallen into the hand of the uncircumcised.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_19" data-id="JG15_19">And God cleaveth the hollow place which [is] in Lehi, and  waters come out of it, and he drinketh, and his spirit cometh  back, and he reviveth; therefore hath [one] called its name  `The fountain of him who is calling,' which [is] in Lehi unto  this day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_20" data-id="JG15_20">And he judgeth Israel in the days of the Philistines  twenty years.</span>
