<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM8_2" data-id="AM8_2">And He saith, `What art thou seeing, Amos?' and I say, `A  basket of summer-fruit.' And Jehovah saith unto me: `The end  hath come unto My people Israel, I do not add any more to pass  over to it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM8_3" data-id="AM8_3">And howled have songstresses of a palace in that day, An  affirmation of the Lord Jehovah, Many [are] the carcases, into  any place throw -- hush!</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM8_4" data-id="AM8_4">Hear this, ye who are swallowing up the needy, To cause to  cease the poor of the land,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM8_5" data-id="AM8_5">Saying, When doth the new moon pass, And we sell ground  corn? And the sabbath, and we open out pure corn? To make  little the ephah, And to make great the shekel, And to use  perversely balances of deceit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM8_6" data-id="AM8_6">To purchase with money the poor, And the needy for a pair of  sandals, Yea, the refuse of the pure corn we sell.</span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM8_8" data-id="AM8_8">For this doth not the land tremble, And mourned hath every  dweller in it? And come up as a flood hath all of it. And it  hath been cast out, and hath sunk, Like the flood of Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM8_9" data-id="AM8_9">And it hath come to pass in that day, An affirmation of the  Lord Jehovah, I have caused the sun to go in at noon, And  caused darkness on the land in a day of light,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM8_10" data-id="AM8_10">And have turned your festivals to mourning, And all your  songs to lamentation, And caused sackcloth to come up on all  loins, And on every head -- baldness, And made it as a mourning  [of] an only one, And its latter end as a day of bitterness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM8_11" data-id="AM8_11">Lo, days are coming, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah,  And I have sent a famine into the land, Not a famine of bread,  nor a thirst of water But of hearing the words of Jehovah.</span>
