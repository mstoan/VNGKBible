<div class="c">5</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_1" data-id="JN5_1">After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus  went up to Jerusalem,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_2" data-id="JN5_2">and there is in Jerusalem by the sheep-[gate] a pool that is  called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_3" data-id="JN5_3">in these were lying a great multitude of the ailing, blind,  lame, withered, waiting for the moving of the water,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_4" data-id="JN5_4">for a messenger at a set time was going down in the pool,  and was troubling the water, the first then having gone in  after the troubling of the water, became whole of whatever  sickness he was held.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_5" data-id="JN5_5">and there was a certain man there being in ailment thirty  and eight years,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_6" data-id="JN5_6">him Jesus having seen lying, and having known that he is  already a long time, he saith to him, `Dost thou wish to become  whole?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_7" data-id="JN5_7">The ailing man answered him, `Sir, I have no man, that, when  the water may be troubled, he may put me into the pool, and  while I am coming, another doth go down before me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_8" data-id="JN5_8">Jesus saith to him, `Rise, take up thy couch, and be  walking;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_9" data-id="JN5_9">and immediately the man became whole, and he took up his  couch, and was walking, and it was a sabbath on that day,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_10" data-id="JN5_10">the Jews then said to him that hath been healed, `It is a  sabbath; it is not lawful to thee to take up the couch.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_11" data-id="JN5_11">He answered them, `He who made me whole -- that one said to  me, Take up thy couch, and be walking;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_12" data-id="JN5_12">they questioned him, then, `Who is the man who is saying to  thee, Take up thy couch and be walking?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_13" data-id="JN5_13">But he that was healed had not known who he is, for Jesus  did move away, a multitude being in the place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_14" data-id="JN5_14">After these things, Jesus findeth him in the temple, and  said to him, `Lo, thou hast become whole; sin no more, lest  something worse may happen to thee.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_15" data-id="JN5_15">The man went away, and told the Jews that it is Jesus who  made him whole,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_16" data-id="JN5_16">and because of this were the Jews persecuting Jesus, and  seeking to kill him, because these things he was doing on a  sabbath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_17" data-id="JN5_17">And Jesus answered them, `My Father till now doth work, and  I work;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_18" data-id="JN5_18">because of this, then, were the Jews seeking the more to  kill him, because not only was he breaking the sabbath, but he  also called God his own Father, making himself equal to God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_19" data-id="JN5_19">Jesus therefore responded and said to them, `Verily,  verily, I say to you, The Son is not able to do anything of  himself, if he may not see the Father doing anything; for  whatever things He may do, these also the Son in like manner  doth;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_20" data-id="JN5_20">for the Father doth love the Son, and doth shew to him all  things that He himself doth; and greater works than these He  will shew him, that ye may wonder.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_21" data-id="JN5_21">`For, as the Father doth raise the dead, and doth make  alive, so also the Son doth make alive whom he willeth;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_22" data-id="JN5_22">for neither doth the Father judge any one, but all the  judgment He hath given to the Son,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_23" data-id="JN5_23">that all may honour the Son according as they honour the  Father; he who is not honouring the Son, doth not honour the  Father who sent him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_24" data-id="JN5_24">`Verily, verily, I say to you -- He who is hearing my word,  and is believing Him who sent me, hath life age-during, and to  judgment he doth not come, but hath passed out of the death to  the life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_25" data-id="JN5_25">`Verily, verily, I say to you -- There cometh an hour, and  it now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of  God, and those having heard shall live;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_26" data-id="JN5_26">for, as the Father hath life in himself, so He gave also to  the Son to have life in himself,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_27" data-id="JN5_27">and authority He gave him also to do judgment, because he  is Son of Man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_28" data-id="JN5_28">`Wonder not at this, because there doth come an hour in  which all those in the tombs shall hear his voice,</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_29" data-id="JN5_29">and they shall come forth; those who did the good things to  a rising again of life, and those who practised the evil things  to a rising again of judgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_30" data-id="JN5_30">`I am not able of myself to do anything; according as I  hear I judge, and my judgment is righteous, because I seek not  my own will, but the will of the Father who sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_31" data-id="JN5_31">`If I testify concerning myself, my testimony is not true;</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_32" data-id="JN5_32">another there is who is testifying concerning me, and I  have known that the testimony that he doth testify concerning  me is true;</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_33" data-id="JN5_33">ye have sent unto John, and he hath testified to the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_34" data-id="JN5_34">`But I do not receive testimony from man, but these things  I say that ye may be saved;</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_35" data-id="JN5_35">he was the burning and shining lamp, and ye did will to be  glad, for an hour, in his light.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_36" data-id="JN5_36">`But I have the testimony greater than John's, for the  works that the Father gave me, that I might finish them, the  works themselves that I do, they testify concerning me, that  the Father hath sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_37" data-id="JN5_37">`And the Father who sent me Himself hath testified  concerning me; ye have neither heard His voice at any time, nor  His appearance have ye seen;</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_38" data-id="JN5_38">and His word ye have not remaining in you, because whom He  sent, him ye do not believe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_39" data-id="JN5_39">`Ye search the Writings, because ye think in them to have  life age-during, and these are they that are testifying  concerning me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_40" data-id="JN5_40">and ye do not will to come unto me, that ye may have life;</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_41" data-id="JN5_41">glory from man I do not receive,</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_42" data-id="JN5_42">but I have known you, that the love of God ye have not in  yourselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_43" data-id="JN5_43">`I have come in the name of my Father, and ye do not  receive me; if another may come in his own name, him ye will  receive;</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_44" data-id="JN5_44">how are ye able -- ye -- to believe, glory from one another  receiving, and the glory that [is] from God alone ye seek not?</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_45" data-id="JN5_45">`Do not think that I will accuse you unto the Father; there  is who is accusing you, Moses -- in whom ye have hoped;</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_46" data-id="JN5_46">for if ye were believing Moses, ye would have been  believing me, for he wrote concerning me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_47" data-id="JN5_47">but if his writings ye believe not, how shall ye believe my  sayings?'</span>
