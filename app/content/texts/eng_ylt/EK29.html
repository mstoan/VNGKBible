<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK29_2" data-id="EK29_2">`Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt,  and prophesy concerning him, and concerning Egypt -- all of it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK29_3" data-id="EK29_3">Speak, and thou hast said: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo,  I [am] against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt! The great dragon  that is crouching in the midst of his floods, Who hath said, My  flood [is] my own, And I -- I have made it [for] myself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK29_4" data-id="EK29_4">And I have put hooks in thy jaws, And I have caused the  fish of thy floods to cleave to thy scales, And I have caused  thee to come up from the midst of thy floods, And every fish of  thy floods to thy scales doth cleave.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK29_5" data-id="EK29_5">And I have left thee in the wilderness, Thou and every fish  of thy floods, On the face of the field thou dost fall, Thou  art not gathered nor assembled, To the beast of the earth and  to the fowl of the heavens I have given thee for food.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK29_6" data-id="EK29_6">And known have all inhabitants of Egypt That I [am]  Jehovah, Because of their being a staff of reed to the house of  Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK29_7" data-id="EK29_7">In their taking hold of thee by thy hand, -- thou art  crushed, And hast rent to them all the shoulder, And in their  leaning on thee thou art broken, And hast caused all their  thighs to stand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK29_8" data-id="EK29_8">Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I am bringing  in against thee a sword, And have cut off from thee man and  beast.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK29_9" data-id="EK29_9">And the land of Egypt hath been for a desolation and a  waste, And they have known that I [am] Jehovah. Because he  said: The flood [is] mine, and I made [it].</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK29_10" data-id="EK29_10">Therefore, lo, I [am] against thee, and against thy  floods, And have given the land of Egypt for wastes, A waste, a  desolation, from Migdol to Syene, And unto the border of Cush.</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK29_12" data-id="EK29_12">And I have made the land of Egypt a desolation, In the  midst of desolate lands, And its cities, in the midst of waste  cities, Are a desolation forty years, And I have scattered the  Egyptians among nations, And I have dispersed them through  lands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK29_13" data-id="EK29_13">But thus said the Lord Jehovah: At the end of forty years  I gather the Egyptians Out of the peoples whither they have  been scattered,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK29_14" data-id="EK29_14">And I have turned back [to] the captivity of Egypt, And I  have brought them back [To] the land of Pathros, to the land of  their birth, And they have been there a low kingdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK29_15" data-id="EK29_15">Of the kingdoms it is lowest, And it lifteth not up itself  any more above the nations, And I have made them few, So as not  to rule among nations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK29_16" data-id="EK29_16">And it is no more to the house of Israel for a confidence,  Bringing iniquity to remembrance, By their turning after them,  And they have known that I [am] the Lord Jehovah.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK29_19" data-id="EK29_19">Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah, Lo, I am giving to  Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon the land of Egypt, And he hath  taken away its store, And hath taken its spoil, and taken its  prey, And it hath been a reward to his force.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK29_20" data-id="EK29_20">His wage for which he laboured I have given to him, The  land of Egypt -- in that they wrought for Me, An affirmation of  the Lord Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK29_21" data-id="EK29_21">In that day I cause to shoot up a horn to the house of  Israel, And to thee I give an opening of the mouth in their  midst, And they have known that I [am] Jehovah!'</span>
