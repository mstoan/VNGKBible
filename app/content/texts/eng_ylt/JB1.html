<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB1_2" data-id="JB1_2">And there are borne to him seven sons and three daughters,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB1_3" data-id="JB1_3">and his substance is seven thousand sheep, and three  thousand camels, and five hundred pairs of oxen, and five  hundred she-asses, and a service very abundant; and that man is  greater than any of the sons of the east.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB1_4" data-id="JB1_4">And his sons have gone and made a banquet -- the house of  each [in] his day -- and have sent and called to their three  sisters to eat and to drink with them;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB1_5" data-id="JB1_5">and it cometh to pass, when they have gone round the days of  the banquet, that Job doth send and sanctify them, and hath  risen early in the morning, and caused to ascend  burnt-offerings -- the number of them all -- for Job said,  `Perhaps my sons have sinned, yet blessed God in their heart.'  Thus doth Job all the days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB1_6" data-id="JB1_6">And the day is, that sons of God come in to station  themselves by Jehovah, and there doth come also the Adversary  in their midst.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB1_7" data-id="JB1_7">And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, `Whence comest thou?'  And the Adversary answereth Jehovah and saith, `From going to  and fro in the land, and from walking up and down on it.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB1_8" data-id="JB1_8">And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, `Hast thou set thy  heart against My servant Job because there is none like him in  the land, a man perfect and upright, fearing God, and turning  aside from evil?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB1_9" data-id="JB1_9">And the Adversary answereth Jehovah and saith, `For nought  is Job fearing God?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB1_10" data-id="JB1_10">Hast not Thou made a hedge for him, and for his house, and  for all that he hath -- round about?</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB1_11" data-id="JB1_11">The work of his hands Thou hast blessed, and his substance  hath spread in the land, and yet, put forth, I pray Thee, Thy  hand, and strike against anything that he hath -- if not: to  Thy face he doth bless Thee!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB1_12" data-id="JB1_12">And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, `Lo, all that he hath  [is] in thy hand, only unto him put not forth thy hand.' And  the Adversary goeth out from the presence of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB1_13" data-id="JB1_13">And the day is, that his sons and his daughters are eating,  and drinking wine, in the house of their brother, the  first-born.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB1_14" data-id="JB1_14">And a messenger hath come in unto Job and saith, `The oxen  have been plowing, and the she-asses feeding by their sides,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB1_15" data-id="JB1_15">and Sheba doth fall, and take them, and the young men they  have smitten by the mouth of the sword, and I am escaped --  only I alone -- to declare [it] to thee.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB1_16" data-id="JB1_16">While this [one] is speaking another also hath come and  saith, `Fire of God hath fallen from the heavens, and burneth  among the flock, and among the young men, and consumeth them,  and I am escaped -- only I alone -- to declare [it] to thee.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB1_17" data-id="JB1_17">While this [one] is speaking another also hath come and  saith, `Chaldeans made three heads, and rush on the camels, and  take them, and the young men they have smitten by the mouth of  the sword, and I am escaped -- only I alone -- to declare [it]  to thee.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB1_18" data-id="JB1_18">While this [one] is speaking another also hath come and  saith, `Thy sons and thy daughters are eating, and drinking  wine, in the house of their brother, the first-born.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB1_19" data-id="JB1_19">And lo, a great wind hath come from over the wilderness,  and striketh against the four corners of the house, and it  falleth on the young men, and they are dead, and I am escaped  -- only I alone -- to declare [it] to thee.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB1_20" data-id="JB1_20">And Job riseth, and rendeth his robe, and shaveth his head,  and falleth to the earth, and doth obeisance,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB1_21" data-id="JB1_21">and he saith, `Naked came I forth from the womb of my  mother, and naked I turn back thither: Jehovah hath given and  Jehovah hath taken: let the name of Jehovah be blessed.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB1_22" data-id="JB1_22">In all this Job hath not sinned, nor given folly to God.</span>
