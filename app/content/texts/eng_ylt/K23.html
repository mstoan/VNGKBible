<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v K23_2" data-id="K23_2">and doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, only not  like his father, and like his mother, and he turneth aside the  standing-pillar of Baal that his father made;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v K23_3" data-id="K23_3">only to the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat that he caused  Israel to sin he hath cleaved, he hath not turned aside from  it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v K23_4" data-id="K23_4">And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master, and he rendered  to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred  thousand rams, [with] wool,</span>

<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v K23_20" data-id="K23_20">And it cometh to pass in the morning, at the ascending of  the [morning]-present, that lo, waters are coming in from the  way of Edom, and the land is filled with the waters,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v K23_21" data-id="K23_21">and all Moab have heard that the kings have come up to  fight against them, and they are called together, from every  one girding on a girdle and upward, and they stand by the  border.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v K23_22" data-id="K23_22">And they rise early in the morning, and the sun hath shone  on the waters, and the Moabites see, from over-against, the  waters red as blood,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v K23_23" data-id="K23_23">and say, `Blood this [is]; the kings have been surely  destroyed, and they smite each his neighbour; and now for  spoil, Moab!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v K23_24" data-id="K23_24">And they come in unto the camp of Israel, and the  Israelites rise, and smite the Moabites, and they flee from  their face; and they enter into Moab, so as to smite Moab,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v K23_25" data-id="K23_25">and the cities they break down, and [on] every good portion  they cast each his stone, and have filled it, and every  fountain of water they stop, and every good tree they cause to  fall -- till one had left its stones in Kir-Haraseth, and the  slingers go round and smite it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v K23_26" data-id="K23_26">And the king of Moab seeth that the battle has been too  strong for him, and he taketh with him seven hundred men,  drawing sword, to cleave through unto the king of Edom, and  they have not been able,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v K23_27" data-id="K23_27">and he taketh his son, the first-born who reigneth in his  stead, and causeth him to ascend -- a burnt-offering on the  wall, and there is great wrath against Israel, and they journey  from off him, and turn back to the land.</span>
