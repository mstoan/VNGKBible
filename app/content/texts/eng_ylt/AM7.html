<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_2" data-id="AM7_2">and it hath come to pass, when it hath finished to consume  the herb of the land, that I say: `Lord Jehovah, forgive, I  pray Thee, How doth Jacob arise -- for he [is] small?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_3" data-id="AM7_3">Jehovah hath repented of this, `It shall not be,' said  Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_4" data-id="AM7_4">Thus hath the Lord Jehovah shewed me, and lo, the Lord  Jehovah is calling to contend by fire, and it consumeth the  great deep, yea, it hath consumed the portion, and I say:</span>
