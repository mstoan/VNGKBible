<div class="c">6</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_1" data-id="GL6_1">Brethren, if a man also may be overtaken in any trespass, ye  who [are] spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness,  considering thyself -- lest thou also may be tempted;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_2" data-id="GL6_2">of one another the burdens bear ye, and so fill up the law  of the Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_3" data-id="GL6_3">for if any one doth think [himself] to be something -- being  nothing -- himself he doth deceive;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_4" data-id="GL6_4">and his own work let each one prove, and then in regard to  himself alone the glorying he shall have, and not in regard to  the other,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_5" data-id="GL6_5">for each one his own burden shall bear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_6" data-id="GL6_6">And let him who is instructed in the word share with him who  is instructing -- in all good things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_7" data-id="GL6_7">Be not led astray; God is not mocked; for what a man may sow  -- that also he shall reap,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_8" data-id="GL6_8">because he who is sowing to his own flesh, of the flesh  shall reap corruption; and he who is sowing to the Spirit, of  the Spirit shall reap life age-during;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_9" data-id="GL6_9">and in the doing good we may not be faint-hearted, for at  the proper time we shall reap -- not desponding;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_10" data-id="GL6_10">therefore, then, as we have opportunity, may we work the  good to all, and especially unto those of the household of the  faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_11" data-id="GL6_11">Ye see in how large letters I have written to you with my  own hand;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_12" data-id="GL6_12">as many as are willing to make a good appearance in the  flesh, these constrain you to be circumcised -- only that for  the cross of the Christ they may not be persecuted,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_13" data-id="GL6_13">for neither do those circumcised themselves keep the law,  but they wish you to be circumcised, that in your flesh they  may glory.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_14" data-id="GL6_14">And for me, let it not be -- to glory, except in the cross  of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which to me the world hath  been crucified, and I to the world;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_15" data-id="GL6_15">for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything,  nor uncircumcision, but a new creation;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_16" data-id="GL6_16">and as many as by this rule do walk -- peace upon them, and  kindness, and on the Israel of God!</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_17" data-id="GL6_17">Henceforth, let no one give me trouble, for I the scars of  the Lord Jesus in my body do bear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_18" data-id="GL6_18">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [is] with your spirit,  brethren! Amen.</span>
