<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_2" data-id="ZP2_2">Before the bringing forth of a statute, As chaff hath the  day passed on, While yet not come in upon you doth the heat of  the anger of Jehovah, While yet not come in upon you doth a  day of the anger of Jehovah,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_3" data-id="ZP2_3">Seek Jehovah, all ye humble of the land, Who His judgment  have done, Seek ye righteousness, seek humility, It may be ye  are hidden in a day of the anger of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_4" data-id="ZP2_4">For Gaza is forsaken, And Ashkelon [is] for a desolation,  Ashdod! at noon they do cast her forth, And Ekron is rooted up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_5" data-id="ZP2_5">Ho! O inhabitants of the sea-coast, Nation of the  Cherethites, A word of Jehovah [is] against you, Canaan, land  of the Philistines, And I have destroyed thee without an  inhabitant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_6" data-id="ZP2_6">And the sea-coast hath been habitations, Cottages [for]  shepherds, and folds [for] a flock.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_7" data-id="ZP2_7">And the coast hath been for the remnant of the house of  Judah, By them they have pleasure, In houses of Ashkelon at  even they lie down, For inspect them doth Jehovah their God,  And He hath turned back [to] their captivity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_8" data-id="ZP2_8">I have heard the reproach of Moab, And the revilings of the  sons of Ammon, Wherewith they reproached My people, And magnify  [themselves] against their border.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_9" data-id="ZP2_9">Therefore, I live, An affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts, God  of Israel, Surely, Moab is as Sodom, And the sons of Ammon as  Gomorrah, An overrunning of nettles and salt-pits, And a  desolation -- unto the age. A residue of My people do seize  them, And a remnant of My nation inherit them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_10" data-id="ZP2_10">This [is] to them for their arrogancy, Because they have  reproached, And they magnify [themselves] against the people of  Jehovah of Hosts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_11" data-id="ZP2_11">Fearful [is] Jehovah against them, For He made bare all  gods of the land, And bow themselves to Him, each from his  place, Do all islanders of the nations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_12" data-id="ZP2_12">Also ye, O Cushim, pierced of My sword [are] they.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_13" data-id="ZP2_13">And He stretcheth His hand against the north, And doth  destroy Asshur, And he setteth Nineveh for a desolation, A dry  land like a wilderness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_14" data-id="ZP2_14">And crouched in her midst have droves, Every beast of the  nation, Both pelican and hedge-hog in her knobs lodge, A voice  doth sing at the window, `Destruction [is] at the threshold,  For the cedar-work is exposed.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_15" data-id="ZP2_15">This [is] the exulting city that is dwelling confidently,  That is saying in her heart, `I [am], and beside me there is  none,' How hath she been for a desolation, A crouching-place  for beasts, Every one passing by her doth hiss, He doth shake  his hand!</span>
