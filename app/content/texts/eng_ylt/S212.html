<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_2" data-id="S212_2">The rich hath flocks and herds very many;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_3" data-id="S212_3">And the poor one hath nothing, Except one little ewe-lamb,  Which he hath bought, and keepeth alive, And it groweth up  with him, And with his sons together; Of his morsel it eateth,  And from his cup it drinketh, And in his bosom it lieth, And it  is to him as a daughter;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_4" data-id="S212_4">And there cometh a traveller to the rich man, And he  spareth to take Of his own flock, and of his own herd, To  prepare for the traveller Who hath come to him, And he taketh  the ewe-lamb of the poor man, And prepareth it for the man Who  hath come unto him.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_5" data-id="S212_5">And the anger of David burneth against the man exceedingly,  and he saith unto Nathan, `Jehovah liveth, surely a son of  death [is] the man who is doing this,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_6" data-id="S212_6">and the ewe-lamb he doth repay fourfold, because that he  hath done this thing, and because that he had no pity.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_7" data-id="S212_7">And Nathan saith unto David, `Thou [art] the man! Thus said  Jehovah, God of Israel, I anointed thee for king over Israel,  and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_8" data-id="S212_8">and I give to thee the house of thy lord, and the wives of  thy lord, into thy bosom, and I give to thee the house of  Israel and of Judah; and if little, then I add to thee such and  such [things].</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_9" data-id="S212_9">`Wherefore hast thou despised the word of Jehovah, to do  the evil thing in His eyes? Uriah the Hittite thou hast smitten  by the sword, and his wife thou hast taken to thee for a wife,  and him thou hast slain by the sword of the Bene-Ammon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_10" data-id="S212_10">`And now, the sword doth not turn aside from thy house  unto the age, because thou hast despised Me, and dost take the  wife of Uriah the Hittite to be to thee for a wife;</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_12" data-id="S212_12">for thou hast done [it] in secret, and I do this thing  before all Israel, and before the sun.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_13" data-id="S212_13">And David saith unto Nathan, `I have sinned against  Jehovah.' And Nathan saith unto David, `Also -- Jehovah hath  caused thy sin to pass away; thou dost not die;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_14" data-id="S212_14">only, because thou hast caused the enemies of Jehovah  greatly to despise by this thing, also the son who is born to  thee doth surely die.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_21" data-id="S212_21">And his servants say unto him, `What [is] this thing thou  hast done? because of the living lad thou hast fasted and dost  weep, and when the lad is dead thou hast risen and dost eat  bread.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_22" data-id="S212_22">And he saith, `While the lad is alive I have fasted, and  weep, for I said, Who knoweth? -- Jehovah doth pity me, and the  lad hath lived;</span>

<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_24" data-id="S212_24">And David comforteth Bath-Sheba his wife, and goeth in  unto her, and lieth with her, and she beareth a son, and he  calleth his name Solomon; and Jehovah hath loved him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_25" data-id="S212_25">and sendeth by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and calleth  his name Jedidiah, because of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_26" data-id="S212_26">And Joab fighteth against Rabbah of the Bene-Ammon, and  captureth the royal city,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_27" data-id="S212_27">and Joab sendeth messengers unto David, and saith, `I have  fought against Rabbah -- also I have captured the city of waters;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_28" data-id="S212_28">and now, gather the rest of the people, and encamp against  the city, and capture it, lest I capture the city, and my name  hath been called upon it.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_29" data-id="S212_29">And David gathereth all the people, and goeth to Rabbah,  and fighteth against it, and captureth it;</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_30" data-id="S212_30">and he taketh the crown of their king from off his head,  and its weight [is] a talent of gold, and precious stones, and  it is on the head of David; and the spoil of the city he hath  brought out, very much;</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_31" data-id="S212_31">and the people who [are] in it he hath brought out, and  setteth to the saw, and to cutting instruments of iron, and to  axes of iron, and hath caused them to pass over into the  brick-kiln; and so he doth to all the cities of the Bene-Ammon;  and David turneth back, and all the people, to Jerusalem.</span>
