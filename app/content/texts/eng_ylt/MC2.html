<div class="c">2</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_1" data-id="MC2_1">Wo [to] those devising iniquity, And working evil on their  beds, In the light of the morning they do it, For their hand is  -- to God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_2" data-id="MC2_2">And they have desired fields, And they have taken violently,  And houses, and they have taken away, And have oppressed a man  and his house, Even a man and his inheritance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_3" data-id="MC2_3">Therefore, thus said Jehovah: Lo, I am devising against this  family evil, From which ye do not remove your necks, Nor walk  loftily, for a time of evil it [is].</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_4" data-id="MC2_4">In that day doth [one] take up for you a simile, And he hath  wailed a wailing of wo, He hath said, We have been utterly  spoiled, The portion of my people He doth change, How doth He  move toward me! To the backslider our fields He apportioneth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_5" data-id="MC2_5">Therefore, thou hast no caster of a line by lot In the  assembly of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_6" data-id="MC2_6">Ye do not prophesy -- they do prophesy, They do not prophesy  to these, It doth not remove shame.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_7" data-id="MC2_7">Doth the house of Jacob say, `Hath the Spirit of Jehovah  been shortened? Are these His doings?' Do not My words benefit  the people that is walking uprightly?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_8" data-id="MC2_8">And yesterday My people for an enemy doth raise himself up,  From the outer garment the honourable ornament ye strip off,  From the confident passers by, Ye who are turning back from  war.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_9" data-id="MC2_9">The women of My people ye cast out from its delightful  house, From its sucklings ye take away My honour to the age.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_10" data-id="MC2_10">Rise and go, for this [is] not the rest, Because of  uncleanness it doth corrupt, And corruption is powerful.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_11" data-id="MC2_11">If one is going [with] the wind, And [with] falsehood hath  lied: `I prophesy to thee of wine, and of strong drink,' He  hath been the prophet of this people!</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_12" data-id="MC2_12">I do surely gather thee, O Jacob, all of thee, I surely  bring together the remnant of Israel, Together I do set it as  the flock of Bozrah, As a drove in the midst of its pasture, It  maketh a noise because of man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_13" data-id="MC2_13">Gone up hath the breaker before them, They have broken  through, Yea, they pass through the gate, Yea, they go out  through it, And pass on doth their king before them, And  Jehovah at their head!</span>
