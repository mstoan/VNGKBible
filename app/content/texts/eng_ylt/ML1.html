<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_2" data-id="ML1_2">I have loved you, said Jehovah, And ye have said, `In what  hast Thou loved us?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_3" data-id="ML1_3">Is not Esau Jacob's brother? -- an affirmation of Jehovah,  And I love Jacob, and Esau I have hated, And I make his  mountains a desolation, And his inheritance for dragons of a  wilderness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_4" data-id="ML1_4">Because Edom saith, `We have been made poor, And we turn  back and we build the wastes,' Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: They  do build, and I do destroy, And [men] have called to them, `O  region of wickedness,' `O people whom Jehovah defied to the  age.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_5" data-id="ML1_5">And your eyes do see, and ye say, `Magnified is Jehovah  beyond the border of Israel,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_6" data-id="ML1_6">A son honoureth a father, and a servant his master. And if I  [am] a father, where [is] Mine honour? And if I [am] a master,  where [is] My fear? Said Jehovah of Hosts to you, O priests,  despising My name! And ye have said: `In what have we despised  Thy name?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_7" data-id="ML1_7">Ye are bringing nigh on Mine altar polluted bread, And ye  have said: `In what have we polluted Thee?' In your saying:  `The table of Jehovah -- it [is] despicable,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_8" data-id="ML1_8">And when ye bring nigh the blind for sacrifice, `There is no  evil,' And when ye bring nigh the lame and sick, `There is no  evil;' Bring it near, I pray thee, to thy governor -- Doth he  accept thee? or doth he lift up thy face? Said Jehovah of  Hosts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_9" data-id="ML1_9">And now, appease, I pray thee, the face of God, And He doth  favour us; From your own hand hath this been, Doth He accept of  you appearances? Said Jehovah of Hosts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_10" data-id="ML1_10">Who [is] even among you, And he shutteth the two-leaved  doors? Yea, ye do not kindle Mine altar for nought, I have no  pleasure in you, said Jehovah of Hosts, And a present I do not  accept of your hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_11" data-id="ML1_11">For, from the rising of the sun to its going in, Great [is]  My name among nations, And in every place perfume is brought  nigh to My name, and a pure present, For great [is] My name  among nations, Said Jehovah of Hosts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_12" data-id="ML1_12">And ye are polluting it in your saying, `The table of  Jehovah -- it is polluted, As to its fruit -- despicable is its  food.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_13" data-id="ML1_13">And ye have said, `Lo, what a weariness,' And ye have  puffed at it, said Jehovah of Hosts, And ye have brought in  plunder, And the lame and the sick, And ye have brought in the  present! Do I accept it from your hand? said Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_14" data-id="ML1_14">And cursed [is] a deceiver, who hath in his drove a male,  And is vowing, and is sacrificing a marred thing to the Lord,  For a great king [am] I, said Jehovah of Hosts, And My name  [is] revered among nations!</span>
