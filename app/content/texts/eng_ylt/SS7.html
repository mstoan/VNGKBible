<div class="c">7</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_1" data-id="SS7_1">As the chorus of `Mahanaim.' How beautiful were thy feet  with sandals, O daughter of Nadib. The turnings of thy sides  [are] as ornaments, Work of the hands of an artificer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_2" data-id="SS7_2">Thy waist [is] a basin of roundness, It lacketh not the  mixture, Thy body a heap of wheat, fenced with lilies,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_3" data-id="SS7_3">Thy two breasts as two young ones, twins of a roe,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_4" data-id="SS7_4">Thy neck as a tower of the ivory, Thine eyes pools in  Heshbon, near the gate of Bath-Rabbim, Thy face as a tower of  Lebanon looking to Damascus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_5" data-id="SS7_5">Thy head upon thee as Carmel, And the locks of thy head as  purple, The king is bound with the flowings!</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_6" data-id="SS7_6">How fair and how pleasant hast thou been, O love, in  delights.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_7" data-id="SS7_7">This thy stature hath been like to a palm, And thy breasts  to clusters.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_8" data-id="SS7_8">I said, `Let me go up on the palm, Let me lay hold on its  boughs, Yea, let thy breasts be, I pray thee, as clusters of  the vine, And the fragrance of thy face as citrons,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_9" data-id="SS7_9">And thy palate as the good wine --' Flowing to my beloved  in uprightness, Strengthening the lips of the aged!</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_10" data-id="SS7_10">I [am] my beloved's, and on me [is] his desire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_11" data-id="SS7_11">Come, my beloved, we go forth to the field,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_12" data-id="SS7_12">We lodge in the villages, we go early to the vineyards, We  see if the vine hath flourished, The sweet smelling-flower hath  opened. The pomegranates have blossomed, There do I give to  thee my loves;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS7_13" data-id="SS7_13">The mandrakes have given fragrance, And at our openings all  pleasant things, New, yea, old, my beloved, I laid up for thee!</span>
