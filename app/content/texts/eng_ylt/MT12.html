<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_2" data-id="MT12_2">and the Pharisees having seen, said to him, `Lo, thy  disciples do that which it is not lawful to do on a sabbath.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_3" data-id="MT12_3">And he said to them, `Did ye not read what David did, when  he was hungry, himself and those with him --</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_4" data-id="MT12_4">how he went into the house of God, and the loaves of the  presentation did eat, which it is not lawful to him to eat, nor  to those with him, except to the priests alone?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_5" data-id="MT12_5">`Or did ye not read in the Law, that on the sabbaths the  priests in the temple do profane the sabbath, and are  blameless?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_6" data-id="MT12_6">and I say to you, that a greater than the temple is here;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_7" data-id="MT12_7">and if ye had known what is: Kindness I will, and not  sacrifice -- ye had not condemned the blameless,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_8" data-id="MT12_8">for the son of man is lord even of the sabbath.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_9" data-id="MT12_9">And having departed thence, he went to their synagogue,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_10" data-id="MT12_10">and lo, there was a man having the hand withered, and they  questioned him, saying, `Is it lawful to heal on the sabbaths?'  that they might accuse him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_11" data-id="MT12_11">And he said to them, `What man shall be of you, who shall  have one sheep, and if this may fall on the sabbaths into a  ditch, will not lay hold on it and raise [it]?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_12" data-id="MT12_12">How much better, therefore, is a man than a sheep? -- so  that it is lawful on the sabbaths to do good.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_13" data-id="MT12_13">Then saith he to the man, `Stretch forth thy hand,' and he  stretched [it] forth, and it was restored whole as the other.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_14" data-id="MT12_14">And the Pharisees having gone forth, held a consultation  against him, how they might destroy him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_15" data-id="MT12_15">and Jesus having known, withdrew thence, and there  followed him great multitudes, and he healed them all,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_16" data-id="MT12_16">and did charge them that they might not make him manifest,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_17" data-id="MT12_17">that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah  the prophet, saying,</span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_22" data-id="MT12_22">Then was brought to him a demoniac, blind and dumb, and he  healed him, so that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_23" data-id="MT12_23">And all the multitudes were amazed, and said, `Is this the  Son of David?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_24" data-id="MT12_24">but the Pharisees having heard, said, `This one doth not  cast out demons, except by Beelzeboul, ruler of the demons.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_25" data-id="MT12_25">And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, `Every  kingdom having been divided against itself is desolated, and no  city or house having been divided against itself, doth stand,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_26" data-id="MT12_26">and if the Adversary doth cast out the Adversary, against  himself he was divided, how then doth his kingdom stand?</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_27" data-id="MT12_27">`And if I, by Beelzeboul, do cast out the demons, your  sons -- by whom do they cast out? because of this they -- they  shall be your judges.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_28" data-id="MT12_28">`But if I, by the Spirit of God, do cast out the demons,  then come already unto you did the reign of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_29" data-id="MT12_29">`Or how is one able to go into the house of the strong  man, and to plunder his goods, if first he may not bind the  strong man? and then his house he will plunder.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_30" data-id="MT12_30">`He who is not with me is against me, and he who is not  gathering with me, doth scatter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_31" data-id="MT12_31">Because of this I say to you, all sin and evil speaking  shall be forgiven to men, but the evil speaking of the Spirit  shall not be forgiven to men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_32" data-id="MT12_32">And whoever may speak a word against the Son of Man it  shall be forgiven to him, but whoever may speak against the  Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this age,  nor in that which is coming.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_33" data-id="MT12_33">`Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make  the tree bad, and its fruit bad, for from the fruit is the tree  known.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_34" data-id="MT12_34">`Brood of vipers! how are ye able to speak good things --  being evil? for out of the abundance of the heart doth the  mouth speak.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_35" data-id="MT12_35">The good man out of the good treasure of the heart doth  put forth the good things, and the evil man out of the evil  treasure doth put forth evil things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_36" data-id="MT12_36">`And I say to you, that every idle word that men may  speak, they shall give for it a reckoning in a day of  judgment;</span>
