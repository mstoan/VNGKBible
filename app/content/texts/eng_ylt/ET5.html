<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET5_2" data-id="ET5_2">and it cometh to pass, at the king's seeing Esther the queen  standing in the court, she hath received grace in his eyes, and  the king holdeth out to Esther the golden sceptre that [is] in  his hand, and Esther draweth near, and toucheth the top of the  sceptre.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET5_3" data-id="ET5_3">And the king saith to her, `What -- to thee Esther, O queen?  and what thy request? unto the half of the kingdom -- and it is  given to thee.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET5_4" data-id="ET5_4">And Esther saith, `If unto the king [it be] good, the king  doth come in, and Haman, to-day, unto the banquet that I have  made for him;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET5_5" data-id="ET5_5">and the king saith, `Haste ye Haman -- to do the word of  Esther;' and the king cometh in, and Haman, unto the banquet  that Esther hath made.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET5_6" data-id="ET5_6">And the king saith to Esther, during the banquet of wine,  `What [is] thy petition? and it is given to thee; and what thy  request? unto the half of the kingdom -- and it is done.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET5_7" data-id="ET5_7">And Esther answereth and saith, `My petition and my request  [is]:</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET5_9" data-id="ET5_9">And Haman goeth forth on that day rejoicing and glad in  heart, and at Haman's seeing Mordecai in the gate of the king,  and he hath not risen nor moved for him, then is Haman full of  fury against Mordecai.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET5_10" data-id="ET5_10">And Haman forceth himself, and cometh in unto his house,  and sendeth, and bringeth in his friends, and Zeresh his wife,</span>
