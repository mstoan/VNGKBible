<div class="c">27</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_1" data-id="MT27_1">And morning having come, all the chief priests and the  elders of the people took counsel against Jesus, so as to put  him to death;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_2" data-id="MT27_2">and having bound him, they did lead away, and delivered him  up to Pontius Pilate, the governor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_3" data-id="MT27_3">Then Judas -- he who delivered him up -- having seen that  he was condemned, having repented, brought back the thirty  silverlings to the chief priests, and to the elders, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_4" data-id="MT27_4">`I did sin, having delivered up innocent blood;' and they  said, `What -- to us? thou shalt see!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_5" data-id="MT27_5">and having cast down the silverlings in the sanctuary, he  departed, and having gone away, he did strangle himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_6" data-id="MT27_6">And the chief priests having taken the silverlings, said,  `It is not lawful to put them to the treasury, seeing it is the  price of blood;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_7" data-id="MT27_7">and having taken counsel, they bought with them the field  of the potter, for the burial of strangers;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_8" data-id="MT27_8">therefore was that field called, `Field of blood,' unto  this day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_9" data-id="MT27_9">Then was fulfilled that spoken through Jeremiah the  prophet, saying, `And I took the thirty silverlings, the price  of him who hath been priced, whom they of the sons of Israel  did price,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_10" data-id="MT27_10">and gave them for the field of the potter, as the Lord did  appoint to me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_11" data-id="MT27_11">And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor did  question him, saying, `Art thou the king of the Jews!' And  Jesus said to him, `Thou sayest.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_12" data-id="MT27_12">And in his being accused by the chief priests and the  elders, he did not answer any thing,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_13" data-id="MT27_13">then saith Pilate to him, `Dost thou not hear how many  things they witness against thee?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_14" data-id="MT27_14">And he did not answer him, not even to one word, so that  the governor did wonder greatly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_15" data-id="MT27_15">And at the feast the governor had been accustomed to  release one to the multitude, a prisoner, whom they willed,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_16" data-id="MT27_16">and they had then a noted prisoner, called Barabbas,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_17" data-id="MT27_17">they therefore having been gathered together, Pilate said  to them, `Whom will ye I shall release to you? Barabbas or  Jesus who is called Christ?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_18" data-id="MT27_18">for he had known that because of envy they had delivered  him up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_19" data-id="MT27_19">And as he is sitting on the tribunal, his wife sent unto  him, saying, `Nothing -- to thee and to that righteous one, for  many things did I suffer to-day in a dream because of him.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_20" data-id="MT27_20">And the chief priests and the elders did persuade the  multitudes that they might ask for themselves Barabbas, and  might destroy Jesus;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_21" data-id="MT27_21">and the governor answering said to them, `Which of the two  will ye [that] I shall release to you?' And they said,  `Barabbas.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_22" data-id="MT27_22">Pilate saith to them, `What then shall I do with Jesus who  is called Christ?' They all say to him, `Let be crucified!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_23" data-id="MT27_23">And the governor said, `Why, what evil did he?' and they  were crying out the more, saying, `Let be crucified.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_24" data-id="MT27_24">And Pilate having seen that it profiteth nothing, but  rather a tumult is made, having taken water, he did wash the  hands before the multitude, saying, `I am innocent from the  blood of this righteous one; ye -- ye shall see;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_25" data-id="MT27_25">and all the people answering said, `His blood [is] upon  us, and upon our children!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_26" data-id="MT27_26">Then did he release to them Barabbas, and having scourged  Jesus, he delivered [him] up that he may be crucified;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_27" data-id="MT27_27">then the soldiers of the governor having taken Jesus to  the Praetorium, did gather to him all the band;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_28" data-id="MT27_28">and having unclothed him, they put around him a crimson  cloak,</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_29" data-id="MT27_29">and having plaited him a crown out of thorns they put [it]  on his head, and a reed in his right hand, and having kneeled  before him, they were mocking him, saying, `Hail, the king of  the Jews.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_30" data-id="MT27_30">And having spit on him, they took the reed, and were  smiting on his head;</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_31" data-id="MT27_31">and when they had mocked him, they took off from him the  cloak, and put on him his own garments, and led him away to  crucify [him].</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_32" data-id="MT27_32">And coming forth, they found a man, a Cyrenian, by name  Simon: him they impressed that he might bear his cross;</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_33" data-id="MT27_33">and having come to a place called Golgotha, that is called  Place of a Skull,</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_34" data-id="MT27_34">they gave him to drink vinegar mixed with gall, and having  tasted, he would not drink.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_35" data-id="MT27_35">And having crucified him, they divided his garments,  casting a lot, that it might be fulfilled that was spoken by  the prophet, `They divided my garments to themselves, and over  my vesture they cast a lot;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_36" data-id="MT27_36">and sitting down, they were watching him there,</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_37" data-id="MT27_37">and they put up over his head, his accusation written,  `This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_38" data-id="MT27_38">Then crucified with him are two robbers, one on the right  hand, and one on the left,</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_39" data-id="MT27_39">and those passing by were speaking evil of him, wagging  their heads,</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_40" data-id="MT27_40">and saying, `Thou that art throwing down the sanctuary,  and in three days building [it], save thyself; if Son thou art  of God, come down from the cross.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_41" data-id="MT27_41">And in like manner also the chief priests mocking, with  the scribes and elders, said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_42" data-id="MT27_42">`Others he saved; himself he is not able to save! If he be  King of Israel, let him come down now from the cross, and we  will believe him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_43" data-id="MT27_43">he hath trusted on God, let Him now deliver him, if He  wish him, because he said -- Son of God I am;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_44" data-id="MT27_44">with the same also the robbers, who were crucified with  him, were reproaching him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_45" data-id="MT27_45">And from the sixth hour darkness came over all the land  unto the ninth hour,</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_46" data-id="MT27_46">and about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a great  voice, saying, `Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?' that is, `My God,  my God, why didst Thou forsake me?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_47" data-id="MT27_47">And certain of those standing there having heard, said --  `Elijah he doth call;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_48" data-id="MT27_48">and immediately, one of them having run, and having taken  a spunge, having filled [it] with vinegar, and having put [it]  on a reed, was giving him to drink,</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_49" data-id="MT27_49">but the rest said, `Let alone, let us see if Elijah doth  come -- about to save him.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_50" data-id="MT27_50">And Jesus having again cried with a great voice, yielded  the spirit;</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_51" data-id="MT27_51">and lo, the vail of the sanctuary was rent in two from top  unto bottom, and the earth did quake, and the rocks were rent,</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_52" data-id="MT27_52">and the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints  who have fallen asleep, arose,</span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_53" data-id="MT27_53">and having come forth out of the tombs after his rising,  they went into the holy city, and appeared to many.</span>
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_54" data-id="MT27_54">And the centurion, and those with him watching Jesus,  having seen the earthquake, and the things that were done, were  exceedingly afraid, saying, `Truly this was God's Son.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_55" data-id="MT27_55">And there were there many women beholding from afar, who  did follow Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_56" data-id="MT27_56">among whom was Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of  James and of Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_57" data-id="MT27_57">And evening having come, there came a rich man, from  Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself was discipled to  Jesus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_58" data-id="MT27_58">he having gone near to Pilate, asked for himself the body  of Jesus; then Pilate commanded the body to be given back.</span>
<span class="v-num v-59">59&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_59" data-id="MT27_59">And having taken the body, Joseph wrapped it in clean  linen,</span>
<span class="v-num v-60">60&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_60" data-id="MT27_60">and laid it in his new tomb, that he hewed in the rock,  and having rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, he  went away;</span>
<span class="v-num v-61">61&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_61" data-id="MT27_61">and there were there Mary the Magdalene, and the other  Mary, sitting over-against the sepulchre.</span>
<span class="v-num v-62">62&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_62" data-id="MT27_62">And on the morrow that is after the preparation, were  gathered together the chief priests, and the Pharisees, unto  Pilate,</span>
<span class="v-num v-63">63&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_63" data-id="MT27_63">saying, `Sir, we have remembered that that deceiver said  while yet living, After three days I do rise;</span>
<span class="v-num v-64">64&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_64" data-id="MT27_64">command, then, the sepulchre to be made secure till the  third day, lest his disciples, having come by night, may steal  him away, and may say to the people, He rose from the dead, and  the last deceit shall be worse than the first.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-65">65&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_65" data-id="MT27_65">And Pilate said to them, `Ye have a watch, go away, make  secure -- as ye have known;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-66">66&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_66" data-id="MT27_66">and they, having gone, did make the sepulchre secure,  having sealed the stone, together with the watch.</span>
