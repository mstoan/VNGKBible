<div class="c">13</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_1" data-id="MK13_1">And as he is going forth out of the temple, one of his  disciples saith to him, `Teacher, see! what stones! and what  buildings!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_2" data-id="MK13_2">and Jesus answering said to him, `Seest thou these great  buildings? there may not be left a stone upon a stone, that may  not be thrown down.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_3" data-id="MK13_3">And as he is sitting at the mount of the Olives,  over-against the temple, Peter, and James, and John, and  Andrew, were questioning him by himself,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_4" data-id="MK13_4">`Tell us when these things shall be? and what [is] the sign  when all these may be about to be fulfilled?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_5" data-id="MK13_5">And Jesus answering them, began to say, `Take heed lest any  one may lead you astray,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_6" data-id="MK13_6">for many shall come in my name, saying -- I am [he], and  many they shall lead astray;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_7" data-id="MK13_7">and when ye may hear of wars and reports of wars, be not  troubled, for these behove to be, but the end [is] not yet;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_8" data-id="MK13_8">for nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against  kingdom, and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and  there shall be famines and troubles; beginnings of sorrows  [are] these.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_9" data-id="MK13_9">`And take ye heed to yourselves, for they shall deliver you  up to sanhedrims, and to synagogues, ye shall be beaten, and  before governors and kings ye shall be set for my sake, for a  testimony to them;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_10" data-id="MK13_10">and to all the nations it behoveth first that the good  news be proclaimed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_11" data-id="MK13_11">`And when they may lead you, delivering up, be not anxious  beforehand what ye may speak, nor premeditate, but whatever  may be given to you in that hour, that speak ye, for it is not  ye who are speaking, but the Holy Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_12" data-id="MK13_12">`And brother shall deliver up brother to death, and father  child, and children shall rise up against parents, and shall  put them to death,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_13" data-id="MK13_13">and ye shall be hated by all because of my name, but he  who hath endured to the end -- he shall be saved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_14" data-id="MK13_14">`And when ye may see the abomination of the desolation,  that was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it  ought not, (whoever is reading let him understand), then those  in Judea, let them flee to the mountains;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_15" data-id="MK13_15">and he upon the house-top, let him not come down to the  house, nor come in to take anything out of his house;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_16" data-id="MK13_16">and he who is in the field, let him not turn to the things  behind, to take up his garment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_17" data-id="MK13_17">`And wo to those with child, and to those giving suck, in  those days;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_18" data-id="MK13_18">and pray ye that your flight may not be in winter,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_19" data-id="MK13_19">for those days shall be tribulation, such as hath not been  from the beginning of the creation that God created, till now,  and may not be;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_20" data-id="MK13_20">and if the Lord did not shorten the days, no flesh had  been saved; but because of the chosen, whom He did choose to  Himself, He did shorten the days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_21" data-id="MK13_21">`And then, if any may say to you, Lo, here [is] the  Christ, or, Lo, there, ye may not believe;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_22" data-id="MK13_22">for there shall rise false Christs and false prophets, and  they shall give signs and wonders, to seduce, if possible,  also the chosen;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_23" data-id="MK13_23">and ye, take heed; lo, I have foretold you all things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_24" data-id="MK13_24">`But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall  be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_25" data-id="MK13_25">and the stars of the heaven shall be falling, and the  powers that are in the heavens shall be shaken.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_26" data-id="MK13_26">`And then they shall see the Son of Man coming in clouds  with much power and glory,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_27" data-id="MK13_27">and then he shall send his messengers, and gather together  his chosen from the four winds, from the end of the earth unto  the end of heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_28" data-id="MK13_28">`And from the fig-tree learn ye the simile: when the  branch may already become tender, and may put forth the  leaves, ye know that nigh is the summer;</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_29" data-id="MK13_29">so ye, also, when these ye may see coming to pass, ye know  that it is nigh, at the doors.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_30" data-id="MK13_30">Verily I say to you, that this generation may not pass  away till all these things may come to pass;</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_31" data-id="MK13_31">the heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my words  shall not pass away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_32" data-id="MK13_32">`And concerning that day and the hour no one hath known --  not even the messengers who are in the heaven, not even the  Son -- except the Father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_33" data-id="MK13_33">Take heed, watch and pray, for ye have not known when the  time is;</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_34" data-id="MK13_34">as a man who is gone abroad, having left his house, and  given to his servants the authority, and to each one his work,  did command also the porter that he may watch;</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_35" data-id="MK13_35">watch ye, therefore, for ye have not known when the lord  of the house doth come, at even, or at midnight, or at  cock-crowing, or at the morning;</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_36" data-id="MK13_36">lest, having come suddenly, he may find you sleeping;</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK13_37" data-id="MK13_37">and what I say to you, I say to all, Watch.'</span>
