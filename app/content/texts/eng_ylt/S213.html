<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_2" data-id="S213_2">And Amnon hath distress -- even to become sick, because of  Tamar his sister, for she [is] a virgin, and it is hard in the  eyes of Amnon to do anything to her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_3" data-id="S213_3">And Amnon hath a friend, and his name [is] Jonadab, son of  Shimeah, David's brother, and Jonadab [is] a very wise man,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_4" data-id="S213_4">and saith to him, `Wherefore [art] thou thus lean, O king's  son, morning by morning? dost thou not declare to me?' And Amnon  saith to him, `Tamar -- sister of Absalom my brother -- I am  loving.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_5" data-id="S213_5">And Jonadab saith to him, `Lie down on thy couch, and feign  thyself sick, and thy father hath come in to see thee, and thou  hast said unto him, `Let, I pray thee, Tamar my sister come in  and give me bread to eat; and she hath made the food before  mine eyes so that I see [it], and have eaten from her hand.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_6" data-id="S213_6">And Amnon lieth down, and feigneth himself sick, and the  king cometh in to see him, and Amnon saith unto the king, `Let,  I pray thee, Tamar my sister come, and she maketh before mine  eyes two cakes, and I eat from her hand.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_7" data-id="S213_7">And David sendeth unto Tamar, to the house, saying, `Go, I  pray thee, to the house of Amnon thy brother, and make for him  food.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_28" data-id="S213_28">And Absalom commandeth his young men, saying, `See, I pray  thee, when the heart of Amnon [is] glad with wine, and I have  said unto you, Smite Amnon, that ye have put him to death; fear  not; is it not because I have commanded you? be strong, yea,  become sons of valour.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_29" data-id="S213_29">And the young men of Absalom do to Amnon as Absalom  commanded, and rise do all the sons of the king, and they ride,  each on his mule, and flee.</span>

<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_31" data-id="S213_31">and the king riseth, and rendeth his garments, and lieth  on the earth, and all his servants are standing by [with] rent  garments.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_32" data-id="S213_32">And Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother, answereth and  saith, `Let not my lord say, The whole of the young men, the  sons of the king, they have put to death; for Amnon alone [is]  dead, for by the command of Absalom it hath been appointed from  the day of his humbling Tamar his sister;</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_33" data-id="S213_33">and now, let not my lord the king lay unto his heart the  word, saying, All the sons of the king have died, for Amnon  alone [is] dead.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v S213_34" data-id="S213_34">And Absalom fleeth, and the young man who is watching  lifteth up his eyes and looketh, and lo, much people are coming  by the way behind him, on the side of the hill.</span>
