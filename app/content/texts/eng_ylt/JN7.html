<div class="c">7</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_1" data-id="JN7_1">And Jesus was walking after these things in Galilee, for he  did not wish to walk in Judea, because the Jews were seeking  to kill him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_2" data-id="JN7_2">and the feast of the Jews was nigh -- that of tabernacles --</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_3" data-id="JN7_3">his brethren, therefore, said unto him, `Remove hence, and  go away to Judea, that thy disciples also may behold thy works  that thou dost;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_4" data-id="JN7_4">for no one in secret doth anything, and himself seeketh to  be in public; if thou dost these things -- manifest thyself to  the world;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_5" data-id="JN7_5">for not even were his brethren believing in him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_6" data-id="JN7_6">Jesus, therefore, saith to them, `My time is not yet  present, but your time is always ready;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_7" data-id="JN7_7">the world is not able to hate you, but me it doth hate,  because I testify concerning it that its works are evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_8" data-id="JN7_8">Ye -- go ye up to this feast; I do not yet go up to this  feast, because my time hath not yet been fulfilled;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_9" data-id="JN7_9">and saying these things to them, he remained in Galilee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_10" data-id="JN7_10">And when his brethren went up, then also he himself went up  to the feast, not manifestly, but as in secret;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_11" data-id="JN7_11">the Jews, therefore, were seeking him, in the feast, and  said, `Where is that one?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_12" data-id="JN7_12">and there was much murmuring about him among the  multitudes, some indeed said -- `He is good;' and others said,  `No, but he leadeth astray the multitude;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_13" data-id="JN7_13">no one, however, was speaking freely about him, through  fear of the Jews.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_14" data-id="JN7_14">And it being now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up to  the temple, and he was teaching,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_15" data-id="JN7_15">and the Jews were wondering, saying, `How hath this one  known letters -- not having learned?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_16" data-id="JN7_16">Jesus answered them and said, `My teaching is not mine, but  His who sent me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_17" data-id="JN7_17">if any one may will to do His will, he shall know  concerning the teaching, whether it is of God, or -- I do speak  from myself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_18" data-id="JN7_18">`He who is speaking from himself his own glory doth seek,  but he who is seeking the glory of him who sent him, this one  is true, and unrighteousness is not in him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_19" data-id="JN7_19">hath not Moses given you the law? and none of you doth the  law; why me do ye seek to kill?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_20" data-id="JN7_20">The multitude answered and said, `Thou hast a demon, who  doth seek to kill thee?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_21" data-id="JN7_21">Jesus answered and said to them, `One work I did, and ye  all wonder,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_22" data-id="JN7_22">because of this, Moses hath given you the circumcision --  not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers -- and on a sabbath  ye circumcise a man;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_23" data-id="JN7_23">if a man doth receive circumcision on a sabbath that the  law of Moses may not be broken, are ye wroth with me that I  made a man all whole on a sabbath?</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_24" data-id="JN7_24">judge not according to appearance, but the righteous  judgment judge.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_25" data-id="JN7_25">Certain, therefore, of the Jerusalemites said, `Is not this  he whom they are seeking to kill?</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_26" data-id="JN7_26">and, lo, he doth speak freely, and they say nothing to him;  did the rulers at all know truly that this is truly the Christ?</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_27" data-id="JN7_27">but this one -- we have known whence he is; and the Christ,  when he doth come, no one doth know whence he is.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_28" data-id="JN7_28">Jesus cried, therefore, in the temple, teaching and saying,  `Ye have both known me, and ye have known whence I am; and I  have not come of myself, but He who sent me is true, whom ye  have not known;</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_29" data-id="JN7_29">and I have known Him, because I am from Him, and He did  send me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_30" data-id="JN7_30">They were seeking, therefore, to seize him, and no one laid  the hand on him, because his hour had not yet come,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_31" data-id="JN7_31">and many out of the multitude did believe in him, and said  -- `The Christ -- when he may come -- will he do more signs  than these that this one did?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_32" data-id="JN7_32">The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things  concerning him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent  officers that they may take him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_33" data-id="JN7_33">Jesus, therefore, said to them, `Yet a little time I am  with you, and I go away unto Him who sent me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_34" data-id="JN7_34">ye will seek me, and ye shall not find; and where I am, ye  are not able to come.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_35" data-id="JN7_35">The Jews, therefore, said among themselves, `Whither is  this one about to go that we shall not find him? -- to the  dispersion of the Greeks is he about to go? and to teach the  Greeks;</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_36" data-id="JN7_36">what is this word that he said, Ye will seek me, and ye  shall not find? and, Where I am, ye are not able to come?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_37" data-id="JN7_37">And in the last, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood  and cried, saying, `If any one doth thirst, let him come unto  me and drink;</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_38" data-id="JN7_38">he who is believing in me, according as the Writing said,  Rivers out of his belly shall flow of living water;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_39" data-id="JN7_39">and this he said of the Spirit, which those believing in  him were about to receive; for not yet was the Holy Spirit,  because Jesus was not yet glorified.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_40" data-id="JN7_40">Many, therefore out of the multitude, having heard the  word, said, `This is truly the Prophet;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_41" data-id="JN7_41">others said, `This is the Christ;' and others said, `Why,  out of Galilee doth the Christ come?</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_42" data-id="JN7_42">Did not the Writing say, that out of the seed of David, and  from Bethlehem -- the village where David was -- the Christ  doth come?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_43" data-id="JN7_43">A division, therefore, arose among the multitude because of  him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_44" data-id="JN7_44">And certain of them were willing to seize him, but no one  laid hands on him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_45" data-id="JN7_45">the officers came, therefore, unto the chief priests and  Pharisees, and they said to them, `Wherefore did ye not bring  him?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_46" data-id="JN7_46">The officers answered, `Never so spake man -- as this man.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_47" data-id="JN7_47">The Pharisees, therefore, answered them, `Have ye also been  led astray?</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_48" data-id="JN7_48">did any one out of the rulers believe in him? or out of the  Pharisees?</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_49" data-id="JN7_49">but this multitude, that is not knowing the law, is  accursed.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_50" data-id="JN7_50">Nicodemus saith unto them -- he who came by night unto him  -- being one of them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_51" data-id="JN7_51">`Doth our law judge the man, if it may not hear from him  first, and know what he doth?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_52" data-id="JN7_52">They answered and said to him, `Art thou also out of  Galilee? search and see, that a prophet out of Galilee hath not  risen;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_53" data-id="JN7_53">and each one went on to his house, but Jesus went on to the  mount of the Olives.</span>
