<div class="c">14</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_1" data-id="AC14_1">And it came to pass in Iconium, that they did enter  together into the synagogue of the Jews, and spake, so that  there believed both of Jews and Greeks a great multitude;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_2" data-id="AC14_2">and the unbelieving Jews did stir up and made evil the  souls of the nations against the brethren;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_3" data-id="AC14_3">long time, indeed, therefore, did they abide speaking  boldly in the Lord, who is testifying to the word of His grace,  and granting signs and wonders to come to pass through their  hands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_4" data-id="AC14_4">And the multitude of the city was divided, and some were  with the Jews, and some with the apostles,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_5" data-id="AC14_5">and when there was a purpose both of the nations and of the  Jews with their rulers to use [them] despitefully, and to stone  them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_6" data-id="AC14_6">they having become aware, did flee to the cities of  Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and to the region round about,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_7" data-id="AC14_7">and there they were proclaiming good news.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_8" data-id="AC14_8">And a certain man in Lystra, impotent in the feet, was  sitting, being lame from the womb of his mother -- who never  had walked,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_9" data-id="AC14_9">this one was hearing Paul speaking, who, having stedfastly  beheld him, and having seen that he hath faith to be saved,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_10" data-id="AC14_10">said with a loud voice, `Stand up on thy feet upright;'  and he was springing and walking,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_11" data-id="AC14_11">and the multitudes having seen what Paul did, did lift up  their voice, in the speech of Lycaonia, saying, `The gods,  having become like men, did come down unto us;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_12" data-id="AC14_12">they were calling also Barnabas Zeus, and Paul Hermes,  since he was the leader in speaking.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_13" data-id="AC14_13">And the priest of the Zeus that is before their city, oxen  and garlands unto the porches having brought, with the  multitudes did wish to sacrifice,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_14" data-id="AC14_14">and having heard, the apostles Barnabas and Paul, having  rent their garments, did spring into the multitude, crying</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_15" data-id="AC14_15">and saying, `Men, why these things do ye? and we are men  like-affected with you, proclaiming good news to you, from  these vanities to turn unto the living God, who made the  heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all the things in  them;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_16" data-id="AC14_16">who in the past generations did suffer all the nations to  go on in their ways,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_17" data-id="AC14_17">though, indeed, without witness He did not leave himself,  doing good -- from heaven giving rains to us, and fruitful  seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_18" data-id="AC14_18">and these things saying, scarcely did they restrain the  multitudes from sacrificing to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_19" data-id="AC14_19">And there came thither, from Antioch and Iconium, Jews,  and they having persuaded the multitudes, and having stoned  Paul, drew him outside of the city, having supposed him to be  dead;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_20" data-id="AC14_20">and the disciples having surrounded him, having risen he  entered into the city, and on the morrow he went forth with  Barnabas to Derbe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_21" data-id="AC14_21">Having proclaimed good news also to that city, and having  discipled many, they turned back to Lystra, and Iconium, and  Antioch,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_22" data-id="AC14_22">confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting to remain  in the faith, and that through many tribulations it behoveth  us to enter into the reign of God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_23" data-id="AC14_23">and having appointed to them by vote elders in every  assembly, having prayed with fastings, they commended them to  the Lord in whom they had believed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_24" data-id="AC14_24">And having passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_25" data-id="AC14_25">and having spoken in Perga the word, they went down to  Attalia,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_26" data-id="AC14_26">and thence did sail to Antioch, whence they had been given  by the grace of God for the work that they fulfilled;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_27" data-id="AC14_27">and having come and gathered together the assembly, they  declared as many things as God did with them, and that He did  open to the nations a door of faith;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC14_28" data-id="AC14_28">and they abode there not a little time with the disciples.</span>
