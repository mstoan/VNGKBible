<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS45_2" data-id="IS45_2">`I go before thee, and crooked places make straight,  Two-leaved doors of brass I shiver, And bars of iron I cut  asunder,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS45_3" data-id="IS45_3">And have given to thee treasures of darkness, Even  treasures of secret places, So that thou knowest that I,  Jehovah, Who am calling on thy name -- [am] the God of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS45_4" data-id="IS45_4">For the sake of my servant Jacob, And of Israel My chosen,  I call also thee by thy name, I surname thee, And thou hast not  known Me.</span>

<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS45_6" data-id="IS45_6">So that they know from the rising of the sun, And from the  west, that there is none besides Me, I [am] Jehovah, and there  is none else,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS45_7" data-id="IS45_7">Forming light, and preparing darkness, Making peace, and  preparing evil, I [am] Jehovah, doing all these things.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS45_8" data-id="IS45_8">Drop, ye heavens, from above, And clouds do cause  righteousness to flow, Earth openeth, and they are fruitful,  Salvation and righteousness spring up together, I, Jehovah,  have prepared it.</span>
