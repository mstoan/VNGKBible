<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S114_4" data-id="S114_4">And between the passages where Jonathan sought to pass over  unto the station of the Philistines [is] the edge of a rock on  the one side, and the edge of a rock on the other side, and the  name of the one is Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S114_5" data-id="S114_5">The one edge [is] fixed on the north over-against Michmash,  and the one on the south over-against Gibeah.</span>

<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v S114_27" data-id="S114_27">And Jonathan hath not heard of his father's adjuring the  people, and putteth forth the end of the rod, which [is] in his  hand, and dippeth it in the honeycomb, and bringeth back his  hand unto his mouth -- and his eyes see!</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v S114_28" data-id="S114_28">And a man of the people answereth and saith, `Thy father  certainly adjured the people, saying, Cursed [is] the man who  eateth food to-day; and the people are weary.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v S114_29" data-id="S114_29">And Jonathan saith, `My father hath troubled the land;  see, I pray you, that mine eyes have become bright because I  tasted a little of this honey.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v S114_30" data-id="S114_30">How much more if the people had well eaten to-day of the  spoil of its enemies which it hath found, for now, the smiting  hath not been great among the Philistines.'</span>
