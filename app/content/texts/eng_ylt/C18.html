<div class="c">8</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_1" data-id="C18_1">And concerning the things sacrificed to idols, we have known  that we all have knowledge: knowledge puffeth up, but love  buildeth up;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_2" data-id="C18_2">and if any one doth think to know anything, he hath not yet  known anything according as it behoveth [him] to know;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_3" data-id="C18_3">and if any one doth love God, this one hath been known by  Him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_4" data-id="C18_4">Concerning the eating then of the things sacrificed to  idols, we have known that an idol [is] nothing in the world,  and that there is no other God except one;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_5" data-id="C18_5">for even if there are those called gods, whether in heaven,  whether upon earth -- as there are gods many and lords many --</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_6" data-id="C18_6">yet to us [is] one God, the Father, of whom [are] the all  things, and we to Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through  whom [are] the all things, and we through Him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_7" data-id="C18_7">but not in all men [is] the knowledge, and certain with  conscience of the idol, till now, as a thing sacrificed to an  idol do eat [it], and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_8" data-id="C18_8">But victuals do not commend us to God, for neither if we may  eat are we in advance; nor if we may not eat, are we behind;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_9" data-id="C18_9">but see, lest this privilege of yours may become a  stumbling-block to the infirm,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_10" data-id="C18_10">for if any one may see thee that hast knowledge in an  idol's temple reclining at meat -- shall not his conscience --  he being infirm -- be emboldened to eat the things sacrificed  to idols,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_11" data-id="C18_11">and the brother who is infirm shall perish by thy  knowledge, because of whom Christ died?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_12" data-id="C18_12">and thus sinning in regard to the brethren, and smiting  their weak conscience -- in regard to Christ ye sin;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_13" data-id="C18_13">wherefore, if victuals cause my brother to stumble, I may  eat no flesh -- to the age -- that my brother I may not cause  to stumble.</span>
