<div class="c">12</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_1" data-id="C112_1">And concerning the spiritual things, brethren, I do not  wish you to be ignorant;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_2" data-id="C112_2">ye have known that ye were nations, unto the dumb idols --  as ye were led -- being carried away;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_3" data-id="C112_3">wherefore, I give you to understand that no one, in the  Spirit of God speaking, saith Jesus [is] anathema, and no one  is able to say Jesus [is] Lord, except in the Holy Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_4" data-id="C112_4">And there are diversities of gifts, and the same Spirit;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_5" data-id="C112_5">and there are diversities of ministrations, and the same  Lord;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_6" data-id="C112_6">and there are diversities of workings, and it is the same  God -- who is working the all in all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_7" data-id="C112_7">And to each hath been given the manifestation of the Spirit  for profit;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_8" data-id="C112_8">for to one through the Spirit hath been given a word of  wisdom, and to another a word of knowledge, according to the  same Spirit;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_9" data-id="C112_9">and to another faith in the same Spirit, and to another  gifts of healings in the same Spirit;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_10" data-id="C112_10">and to another in-workings of mighty deeds; and to another  prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits; and to another  [divers] kinds of tongues; and to another interpretation of  tongues:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_11" data-id="C112_11">and all these doth work the one and the same Spirit,  dividing to each severally as he intendeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_12" data-id="C112_12">For, even as the body is one, and hath many members, and  all the members of the one body, being many, are one body, so  also [is] the Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_13" data-id="C112_13">for also in one Spirit we all to one body were baptized,  whether Jews or Greeks, whether servants or freemen, and all  into one Spirit were made to drink,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_14" data-id="C112_14">for also the body is not one member, but many;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_15" data-id="C112_15">if the foot may say, `Because I am not a hand, I am not  of the body;' it is not, because of this, not of the body;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_16" data-id="C112_16">and if the ear may say, `Because I am not an eye, I am not  of the body;' it is not, because of this, not of the body?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_17" data-id="C112_17">If the whole body [were] an eye, where the hearing? if  the whole hearing, where the smelling?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_18" data-id="C112_18">and now, God did set the members each one of them in the  body, according as He willed,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_19" data-id="C112_19">and if all were one member, where the body?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_20" data-id="C112_20">and now, indeed, [are] many members, and one body;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_21" data-id="C112_21">and an eye is not able to say to the hand, `I have no need  of thee;' nor again the head to the feet, `I have no need of  you.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_22" data-id="C112_22">But much more the members of the body which seem to be  more infirm are necessary,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_23" data-id="C112_23">and those that we think to be less honourable of the body,  around these we put more abundant honour, and our unseemly  things have seemliness more abundant,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_24" data-id="C112_24">and our seemly things have no need; but God did temper the  body together, to the lacking part having given more abundant  honour,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_25" data-id="C112_25">that there may be no division in the body, but that the  members may have the same anxiety for one another,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_26" data-id="C112_26">and whether one member doth suffer, suffer with [it] do  all the members, or one member is glorified, rejoice with [it]  do all the members;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_27" data-id="C112_27">and ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_28" data-id="C112_28">And some, indeed, did God set in the assembly, first  apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, afterwards  powers, afterwards gifts of healings, helpings, governings,  divers kinds of tongues;</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_29" data-id="C112_29">[are] all apostles? [are] all prophets? [are] all  teachers? [are] all powers?</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_30" data-id="C112_30">have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do  all interpret?</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_31" data-id="C112_31">and desire earnestly the better gifts; and yet a far  excelling way do I shew to you:</span>
