<div class="c">11</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_1" data-id="ZC11_1">Open, O Lebanon, thy doors, And fire doth devour among thy  cedars.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_2" data-id="ZC11_2">Howl, O fir, for fallen hath the cedar, For their  honourable ones were destroyed, Howl, ye oaks of Bashan, For  come down hath the fenced forest,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_3" data-id="ZC11_3">A voice of the howling of the shepherds! For destroyed was  their robe of honour, A voice of the roaring of young lions!  For destroyed was the excellency of Jordan.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_4" data-id="ZC11_4">Thus said Jehovah my God: `Feed the flock of the slaughter,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_5" data-id="ZC11_5">Whose buyers slay them, and are not guilty, And their  sellers say, Blessed [is] Jehovah, And I am rich, And their  shepherds have no pity on them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_6" data-id="ZC11_6">For I have pity no more on inhabitants of the land, An  affirmation of Jehovah, And lo, I am causing man to come forth,  Each into the hand of his neighbour, And into the hand of his  king, And they have beaten down the land, And I do not deliver  out of their hand.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_7" data-id="ZC11_7">And I feed the flock of slaughter, even you, ye afflicted  of the flock; and I take to me two staves, the one I have  called Pleasantness, and the other I have called Bands, and I  feed the flock.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_8" data-id="ZC11_8">And I cut off the three shepherds in one month, and my soul  is grieved with them, and also their soul hath abhorred me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_9" data-id="ZC11_9">And I say, `I do not feed you, the dying, let die; and the  cut off, let be cut off; and the remaining ones, let each eat  the flesh of its neighbour.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_10" data-id="ZC11_10">And I take My staff Pleasantness, and cut it asunder, to  make void My covenant that I had made with all the peoples:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_11" data-id="ZC11_11">and it is broken in that day, and know well do the  afflicted of the flock who are observing me, that it [is] a  word of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_12" data-id="ZC11_12">And I say unto them: `If good in your eyes, give my hire,  and if not, forbear;' and they weigh out my hire -- thirty  silverlings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_13" data-id="ZC11_13">And Jehovah saith unto me, `Cast it unto the potter;' the  goodly price that I have been prized at by them, and I take the  thirty silverlings, and cast them [to] the house of Jehovah,  unto the potter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_14" data-id="ZC11_14">And I cut asunder my second staff, Bands, to break the  unity between Judah and Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_15" data-id="ZC11_15">And Jehovah saith unto me, `Again take to thee the  instrument of a foolish shepherd.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_16" data-id="ZC11_16">For lo, I am raising up a shepherd in the land, The cut  off he doth not inspect, The shaken off he doth not seek, And  the broken he doth not heal, The standing he doth not sustain,  And the flesh of the fat he doth eat, And their hoofs he doth  break off.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC11_17" data-id="ZC11_17">Wo [to] the worthless shepherd, forsaking the flock, A  sword [is] on his arm, and on his right eye, His arm is utterly  dried up, And his right eye is very dim!'</span>
