<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_2" data-id="AC6_2">and the twelve, having called near the multitude of the  disciples, said, `It is not pleasing that we, having left the  word of God, do minister at tables;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_3" data-id="AC6_3">look out, therefore, brethren, seven men of you who are well  testified of, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may  set over this necessity,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_4" data-id="AC6_4">and we to prayer, and to the ministration of the word, will  give ourselves continually.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_5" data-id="AC6_5">And the thing was pleasing before all the multitude, and  they did choose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy  Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and  Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_6" data-id="AC6_6">whom they did set before the apostles, and they, having  prayed, laid on them [their] hands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_7" data-id="AC6_7">And the word of God did increase, and the number of the  disciples did multiply in Jerusalem exceedingly; a great  multitude also of the priests were obedient to the faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_8" data-id="AC6_8">And Stephen, full of faith and power, was doing great  wonders and signs among the people,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_9" data-id="AC6_9">and there arose certain of those of the synagogue, called of  the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of those  from Cilicia, and Asia, disputing with Stephen,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_10" data-id="AC6_10">and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit  with which he was speaking;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_11" data-id="AC6_11">then they suborned men, saying -- `We have heard him  speaking evil sayings in regard to Moses and God.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_12" data-id="AC6_12">They did stir up also the people, and the elders, and the  scribes, and having come upon [him], they caught him, and  brought [him] to the sanhedrim;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_13" data-id="AC6_13">they set up also false witnesses, saying, `This one doth  not cease to speak evil sayings against this holy place and the  law,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_14" data-id="AC6_14">for we have heard him saying, That this Jesus the Nazarean  shall overthrow this place, and shall change the customs that  Moses delivered to us;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_15" data-id="AC6_15">and gazing at him, all those sitting in the sanhedrim saw  his face as it were the face of a messenger.</span>
