<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_2" data-id="MT6_2">whenever, therefore, thou mayest do kindness, thou mayest  not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do, in the  synagogues, and in the streets, that they may have glory from  men; verily I say to you -- they have their reward!</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_3" data-id="MT6_3">`But thou, doing kindness, let not thy left hand know what  thy right hand doth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_4" data-id="MT6_4">that thy kindness may be in secret, and thy Father who is  seeing in secret Himself shall reward thee manifestly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_5" data-id="MT6_5">`And when thou mayest pray, thou shalt not be as the  hypocrites, because they love in the synagogues, and in the  corners of the broad places -- standing -- to pray, that they  may be seen of men; verily I say to you, that they have their  reward.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_6" data-id="MT6_6">`But thou, when thou mayest pray, go into thy chamber, and  having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who [is] in secret,  and thy Father who is seeing in secret, shall reward thee  manifestly.</span>

Is not the life more than the  nourishment, and the body than the clothing?</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_26" data-id="MT6_26">look to the fowls of the heaven, for they do not sow, nor  reap, nor gather into storehouses, and your heavenly Father  doth nourish them; are not ye much better than they?</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_27" data-id="MT6_27">`And who of you, being anxious, is able to add to his age  one cubit?</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_28" data-id="MT6_28">and about clothing why are ye anxious? consider well the  lilies of the field; how do they grow? they do not labour, nor  do they spin;</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_29" data-id="MT6_29">and I say to you, that not even Solomon in all his glory  was arrayed as one of these.</span>

<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_32" data-id="MT6_32">for all these do the nations seek for, for your  heavenly Father doth know that ye have need of all these;</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_33" data-id="MT6_33">but seek ye first the reign of God and His righteousness,  and all these shall be added to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT6_34" data-id="MT6_34">Be not therefore anxious for the morrow, for the morrow  shall be anxious for its own things; sufficient for the day  [is] the evil of it.</span>
