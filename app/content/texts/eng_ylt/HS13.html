<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS13_2" data-id="HS13_2">And now do they add to sin, And make to them a molten image  of their silver, By their own understanding -- idols, A work of  artizans -- all of it, Of them they say, who [are] sacrificers  among men, `The calves let them kiss.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS13_3" data-id="HS13_3">Therefore they are as a cloud of the morning, And as dew,  rising early, going away, As chaff tossed about out of a floor,  And as smoke out of a window.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS13_4" data-id="HS13_4">And I [am] Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt, And a  God besides Me thou dost not know, And a Saviour -- there is  none save Me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS13_5" data-id="HS13_5">I -- I have known thee in a wilderness, In a land of  droughts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS13_6" data-id="HS13_6">According to their feedings they are satiated, They have  been satiated, And their heart is lifted up, Therefore they  have forgotten Me,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS13_7" data-id="HS13_7">And I am to them as a lion, As a leopard by the way I look  out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS13_8" data-id="HS13_8">I do meet them as a bereaved bear, And I rend the enclosure  of their heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS13_9" data-id="HS13_9">And I consume them there as a lioness, A beast of the field  doth rend them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS13_10" data-id="HS13_10">Thou hast destroyed thyself, O Israel, But in Me [is] thy  help, Where [is] thy king now -- And he doth save thee in all  thy cities? And thy judges of whom thou didst say, `Give to me  a king and heads?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS13_11" data-id="HS13_11">I give to thee a king in Mine anger, And I take away in My  wrath.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS13_14" data-id="HS13_14">From the hand of Sheol I do ransom them, From death I  redeem them, Where [is] thy plague, O death? Where thy  destruction, O Sheol? Repentance is hid from Mine eyes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS13_15" data-id="HS13_15">Though he among brethren produceth fruit, Come in doth an  east wind, a wind of Jehovah, From a wilderness it is coming  up, And it drieth up his fountain, And become dry doth his  spring, It -- it spoileth a treasure -- every desirable vessel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS13_16" data-id="HS13_16">Become desolate doth Samaria, Because she hath rebelled  against her God, By sword they do fall, Their sucklings are  dashed in pieces, And its pregnant ones are ripped up!</span>
