<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_2" data-id="J21_2">because of the truth that is remaining in us, and with us  shall be to the age,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_3" data-id="J21_3">there shall be with you grace, kindness, peace, from God the  Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father,  in truth and love.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_4" data-id="J21_4">I rejoiced exceedingly that I have found of thy children  walking in truth, even as a command we did receive from the  Father;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_5" data-id="J21_5">and now I beseech thee, Kyria, not as writing to thee a new  command, but which we had from the beginning, that we may love  one another,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_6" data-id="J21_6">and this is the love, that we may walk according to His  commands; this is the command, even as ye did hear from the  beginning, that in it ye may walk,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_7" data-id="J21_7">because many leading astray did enter into the world, who  are not confessing Jesus Christ coming in flesh; this one is  he who is leading astray, and the antichrist.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_8" data-id="J21_8">See to yourselves that ye may not lose the things that we  wrought, but a full reward may receive;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_9" data-id="J21_9">every one who is transgressing, and is not remaining in the  teaching of the Christ, hath not God; he who is remaining in  the teaching of the Christ, this one hath both the Father and  the Son;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_10" data-id="J21_10">if any one doth come unto you, and this teaching doth not  bear, receive him not into the house, and say not to him,  `Hail!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_11" data-id="J21_11">for he who is saying to him, `Hail,' hath fellowship with  his evil works.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_12" data-id="J21_12">Many things having to write to you, I did not intend  through paper and ink, but I hope to come unto you, and speak  mouth to mouth, that our joy may be full;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v J21_13" data-id="J21_13">salute thee do the children of thy choice sister. Amen.</span>
