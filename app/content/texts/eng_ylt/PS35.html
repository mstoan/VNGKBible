<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS35_2" data-id="PS35_2">Take hold of shield and buckler, and rise for my help,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS35_3" data-id="PS35_3">And draw out spear and lance, To meet my pursuers. Say to  my soul, `Thy salvation I [am].'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS35_4" data-id="PS35_4">They are ashamed and blush, those seeking my soul, Turned  backward and confounded, Those devising my evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS35_5" data-id="PS35_5">They are as chaff before wind, And a messenger of Jehovah  driving away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS35_6" data-id="PS35_6">Their way is darkness and slipperiness, And a messenger of  Jehovah their pursuer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS35_7" data-id="PS35_7">For without cause they hid for me their netpit, Without  cause they digged for my soul.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS35_14" data-id="PS35_14">As [if] a friend, as [if] my brother, I walked habitually,  As a mourner for a mother, Mourning I have bowed down.</span>
