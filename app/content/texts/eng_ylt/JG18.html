<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG18_2" data-id="JG18_2">And the sons of Dan send, out of their family, five men of  them, men, sons of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to  traverse the land, and to search it, and they say unto them,  `Go, search the land;' and they come into the hill-country of  Ephraim, unto the house of Micah, and lodge there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG18_3" data-id="JG18_3">They [are] with the household of Micah, and they have  discerned the voice of the young man, the Levite, and turn  aside there, and say to him, `Who hath brought thee hither? and  what art thou doing in this [place?] and what to thee here?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG18_4" data-id="JG18_4">And he saith unto them, `Thus and thus hath Micah done to  me; and he hireth me, and I am to him for a priest.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG18_6" data-id="JG18_6">And the priest saith to them, `Go in peace; over-against  Jehovah [is] your way in which ye go.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG18_7" data-id="JG18_7">And the five men go, and come in to Laish, and see the  people which [is] in its midst, dwelling confidently, according  to the custom of Zidonians, quiet and confident; and there is  none putting to shame in the land in [any] thing, possessing  restraint, and they [are] far off from the Zidonians, and have  no word with [any] man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG18_8" data-id="JG18_8">And they come in unto their brethren, at Zorah and Eshtaol,  and their brethren say to them, `What -- ye?'</span>

<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG18_24" data-id="JG18_24">And he saith, `My gods which I made ye have taken, and the  priest, and ye go; and what to me more? and what [is] this ye  say unto me, What -- to thee!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG18_25" data-id="JG18_25">And the sons of Dan say unto him, `Let not thy voice be  heard with us, lest men bitter in soul fall upon you, and thou  hast gathered thy life, and the life of thy household;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG18_26" data-id="JG18_26">and the sons of Dan go on their way, and Micah seeth that  they are stronger than he, and turneth, and goeth back unto his  house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG18_27" data-id="JG18_27">And they have taken that which Micah had made, and the  priest whom he had, and come in against Laish, against a people  quiet and confident, and smite them by the mouth of the sword,  and the city have burnt with fire,</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG18_28" data-id="JG18_28">and there is no deliverer, for it [is] far off from Zidon,  and they have no word with [any] man, and it [is] in the valley  which [is] by Beth-Rehob; and they build the city, and dwell in  it,</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG18_29" data-id="JG18_29">and call the name of the city Dan, by the name of Dan  their father, who was born to Israel; and yet Laish [is] the  name of the city at the first.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG18_30" data-id="JG18_30">And the sons of Dan raise up for themselves the graven  image, and Jonathan son of Gershom, son of Manasseh, he and his  sons have been priests to the tribe of the Danite, till the day  of the removal of [the people] of the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG18_31" data-id="JG18_31">And they appoint for them the graven image of Micah, which  he had made, all the days of the house of God being in Shiloh.</span>
