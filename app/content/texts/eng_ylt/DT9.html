<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT9_2" data-id="DT9_2">a people great and tall, sons of Anakim, whom thou -- thou  hast known, (and thou -- thou hast heard: Who doth station  himself before sons of Anak?)</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT9_3" data-id="DT9_3">and thou hast known to-day, that Jehovah thy God [is] He who  is passing over before thee -- a fire consuming; He doth  destroy them, and He doth humble them before thee, and thou  hast dispossessed them, and destroyed them hastily, as Jehovah  hath spoken to thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT9_4" data-id="DT9_4">`Thou dost not speak in thy heart (in Jehovah thy God's  driving them away from before thee), saying, For my  righteousness hath Jehovah brought me in to possess this land,  seeing for the wickedness of these nations is Jehovah  dispossessing them from thy presence;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT9_5" data-id="DT9_5">not for thy righteousness, and for the uprightness of thy  heart, art thou going in to possess their land; but for the  wickedness of these nations is Jehovah thy God dispossessing  them from before thee; and in order to establish the word which  Jehovah hath sworn to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to  Jacob;</span>
