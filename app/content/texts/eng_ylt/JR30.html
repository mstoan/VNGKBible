<div class="c">30</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_1" data-id="JR30_1">The word that hath been unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_2" data-id="JR30_2">`Thus spake Jehovah, God of Israel, saying, Write for thee  all the words that I have spoken unto thee on a book.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_3" data-id="JR30_3">For, lo, days are coming -- an affirmation of Jehovah --  and I have turned back [to] the captivity of My people Israel  and Judah, said Jehovah, and I have caused them to turn back  unto the land that I gave to their fathers, and they do possess  it.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_4" data-id="JR30_4">And these [are] the words that Jehovah hath spoken  concerning Israel and concerning Judah:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_5" data-id="JR30_5">Surely thus said Jehovah: A voice of trembling we have  heard, Fear -- and there is no peace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_6" data-id="JR30_6">Ask, I pray you, and see, is a male bringing forth?  Wherefore have I seen every man, His hands on his loins, as a  travailing woman, And all faces have been turned to paleness?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_7" data-id="JR30_7">Wo! for great [is] that day, without any like it, Yea, a  time of adversity it [is] to Jacob, Yet out of it he is saved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_8" data-id="JR30_8">And it hath come to pass, in that day, An affirmation of  Jehovah of Hosts, I break his yoke from off thy neck, And thy  bands I draw away, And lay no more service on him do strangers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_9" data-id="JR30_9">And they have served Jehovah their God, And David their  king whom I raise up to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_10" data-id="JR30_10">And thou, be not afraid, My servant Jacob, An affirmation  of Jehovah, Nor be affrighted, O Israel, For, lo, I am saving  thee from afar, And thy seed from the land of their captivity,  And Jacob hath turned back and rested, And is quiet, and there  is none troubling.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_11" data-id="JR30_11">For with thee [am] I, An affirmation of Jehovah -- to save  thee, For I make an end of all the nations Whither I have  scattered thee, Only, of thee I do not make an end, And I have  chastised thee in judgment, And do not entirely acquit thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_12" data-id="JR30_12">For thus said Jehovah: Incurable is thy breach, grievous  thy stroke,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_13" data-id="JR30_13">There is none judging thy cause to bind up, Healing  medicines there are none for thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_14" data-id="JR30_14">all loving thee have forgotten thee, Thee they do not  seek, For with the stroke of an enemy I smote thee, The  chastisement of a fierce one, Because of the abundance of thy  iniquity, Mighty have been thy sins!</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_15" data-id="JR30_15">What! -- thou criest concerning thy breach! Incurable [is]  thy pain, Because of the abundance of thy iniquity, Mighty have  been thy sins! I have done these to thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_16" data-id="JR30_16">Therefore all consuming thee are consumed, And all thine  adversaries -- all of them -- Into captivity do go, And thy  spoilers have been for a spoil, And all thy plunderers I give  up to plunder.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_17" data-id="JR30_17">For I increase health to thee, And from thy strokes I do  heal thee, An affirmation of Jehovah, For `Outcast' they have  called to thee, `Zion it [is], there is none seeking for her.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_18" data-id="JR30_18">Thus said Jehovah: Lo, I turn back [to] the captivity of  the tents of Jacob, And his dwelling places I pity, And the  city hath been built on its heap, And the palace according to  its ordinance remaineth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_19" data-id="JR30_19">And gone forth from them hath thanksgiving, And the voice  of playful ones, And I have multiplied them and they are not  few, And made them honourable, and they are not small.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_20" data-id="JR30_20">And his sons have been as aforetime, And his company  before Me is established, And I have seen after all his  oppressors.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_21" data-id="JR30_21">And his honourable one hath been of himself, And his ruler  from his midst goeth forth, And I have caused him to draw near,  And he hath drawn nigh unto Me, For who [is] he who hath  pledged his heart To draw nigh unto Me? An affirmation of  Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_22" data-id="JR30_22">And ye have been to Me for a people, And I am to you for  God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_23" data-id="JR30_23">Lo, a whirlwind of Jehovah -- Fury hath gone forth -- a  cutting whirlwind, On the head of the wicked it stayeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_24" data-id="JR30_24">The fierceness of the anger of Jehovah Doth not turn back  till His doing, Yea, till His establishing the devices of His  heart, In the latter end of the days we consider it!</span>
