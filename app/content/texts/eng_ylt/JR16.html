<div class="c">16</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR16_1" data-id="JR16_1">And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR16_2" data-id="JR16_2">Thou dost not take to thee a wife, Nor hast thou sons and  daughters in this place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR16_3" data-id="JR16_3">For thus said Jehovah, Of the sons and of the daughters who  are born in this place, And of their mothers -- those bearing  them, And of their fathers -- those begetting them in this  land:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR16_4" data-id="JR16_4">Of painful deaths they die, They are not lamented, nor are  they buried, For dung on the face of the ground they are, And  by sword and by famine are consumed, And their carcase hath  been for food To the fowl of the heavens, And to the beast of  the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR16_5" data-id="JR16_5">For thus said Jehovah: Do not enter the house of a  mourning-feast, Nor go to lament nor bemoan for them, For I  have removed My peace from this people, An affirmation of  Jehovah, The kindness and the mercies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR16_6" data-id="JR16_6">And died have great and small in this land, They are not  buried, and none lament for them, Nor doth any cut himself, nor  become bald for them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR16_7" data-id="JR16_7">Nor do they deal out to them for mourning, To comfort him  concerning the dead, Nor cause them to drink a cup of  consolations For his father and for his mother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR16_8" data-id="JR16_8">A house of banqueting thou dost not enter, To sit with  them, to eat and to drink,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR16_9" data-id="JR16_9">For thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel: Lo, I am  causing to cease from this place, Before your eyes, and in your  days, The voice of joy, and the voice of rejoicing, The voice  of bridegroom and voice of bride.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR16_10" data-id="JR16_10">And it hath come to pass when thou declarest to this  people all these words, and they have said unto thee, `For what  hath Jehovah spoken against us all this great evil? yea, what  [is] our iniquity, and what our sin, that we have sinned  against Jehovah our God?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR16_11" data-id="JR16_11">Then thou hast said unto them: Because that your fathers  have forsaken Me, An affirmation of Jehovah, And go after other  gods, and serve them, And they bow themselves to them, And Me  have forsaken, and My law not kept,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR16_12" data-id="JR16_12">Ye also have done evil above your fathers, And lo, ye are  walking each after the stubbornness of his evil heart, So as  not to hearken unto Me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR16_13" data-id="JR16_13">And I have cast you from off this land, On to a land that  ye have not known, Ye and your fathers, And ye have served  there other gods by day and by night, Where I do not give to  you grace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR16_14" data-id="JR16_14">Therefore, lo, days are coming, An affirmation of Jehovah,  And it is not said any more: `Jehovah liveth, who brought up  The sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR16_15" data-id="JR16_15">But, `Jehovah liveth, who brought up The sons of Israel  out of the land of the north, And out of all the lands whither  He drove them,' And I have brought them back to their land,  That I gave to their fathers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR16_16" data-id="JR16_16">Lo, I am sending for many fishers, An affirmation of  Jehovah, And they have fished them, And after this I send for  many hunters, And they have hunted them from off every  mountain, And from off every hill, and from holes of the rocks.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR16_17" data-id="JR16_17">For Mine eyes [are] upon all their ways, They have not  been hidden from My face, Nor hath their iniquity been  concealed from before Mine eyes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR16_18" data-id="JR16_18">And I have recompensed a first -- A second time -- their  iniquity and their sin, Because of their polluting My land,  With the carcase of their detestable things, Yea, their  abominable things have filled Mine inheritance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR16_19" data-id="JR16_19">O Jehovah, my strength, and my fortress, And my refuge in  a day of adversity, Unto Thee nations do come from the ends of  earth, And say, Only falsehood did our fathers inherit, Vanity,  and none among them is profitable.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR16_20" data-id="JR16_20">Doth man make for himself gods, And they -- no gods?</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR16_21" data-id="JR16_21">Therefore, lo, I am causing them to know at this time, I  cause them to know My hand and My might, And they have known  that My name [is] Jehovah!</span>
