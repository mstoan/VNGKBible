<div class="c">5</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_1" data-id="EP5_1">Become, then, followers of God, as children beloved,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_2" data-id="EP5_2">and walk in love, as also the Christ did love us, and did  give himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an  odour of a sweet smell,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_3" data-id="EP5_3">and whoredom, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it  not even be named among you, as becometh saints;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_4" data-id="EP5_4">also filthiness, and foolish talking, or jesting, -- the  things not fit -- but rather thanksgiving;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_5" data-id="EP5_5">for this ye know, that every whoremonger, or unclean, or  covetous person, who is an idolater, hath no inheritance in  the reign of the Christ and God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_6" data-id="EP5_6">Let no one deceive you with vain words, for because of these  things cometh the anger of God upon the sons of the  disobedience,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_7" data-id="EP5_7">become not, then, partakers with them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_8" data-id="EP5_8">for ye were once darkness, and now light in the Lord; as  children of light walk ye,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_9" data-id="EP5_9">for the fruit of the Spirit [is] in all goodness, and  righteousness, and truth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_10" data-id="EP5_10">proving what is well-pleasing to the Lord,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_11" data-id="EP5_11">and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of the  darkness and rather even convict,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_12" data-id="EP5_12">for the things in secret done by them it is a shame even to  speak of,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_13" data-id="EP5_13">and all the things reproved by the light are manifested,  for everything that is manifested is light;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_14" data-id="EP5_14">wherefore he saith, `Arouse thyself, thou who art sleeping,  and arise out of the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon  thee.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_15" data-id="EP5_15">See, then, how exactly ye walk, not as unwise, but as wise,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_16" data-id="EP5_16">redeeming the time, because the days are evil;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_17" data-id="EP5_17">because of this become not fools, but -- understanding what  [is] the will of the Lord,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_18" data-id="EP5_18">and be not drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but  be filled in the Spirit,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_19" data-id="EP5_19">speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual  songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_20" data-id="EP5_20">giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our  Lord Jesus Christ, to the God and Father;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_21" data-id="EP5_21">subjecting yourselves to one another in the fear of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_22" data-id="EP5_22">The wives! to your own husbands subject yourselves, as to  the Lord,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_23" data-id="EP5_23">because the husband is head of the wife, as also the Christ  [is] head of the assembly, and he is saviour of the body,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_24" data-id="EP5_24">but even as the assembly is subject to Christ, so also  [are] the wives to their own husbands in everything.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_25" data-id="EP5_25">The husbands! love your own wives, as also the Christ did  love the assembly, and did give himself for it,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_26" data-id="EP5_26">that he might sanctify it, having cleansed [it] with the  bathing of the water in the saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_27" data-id="EP5_27">that he might present it to himself the assembly in glory,  not having spot or wrinkle, or any of such things, but that it  may be holy and unblemished;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_28" data-id="EP5_28">so ought the husbands to love their own wives as their own  bodies: he who is loving his own wife -- himself he doth love;</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_29" data-id="EP5_29">for no one ever his own flesh did hate, but doth nourish  and cherish it, as also the Lord -- the assembly,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_30" data-id="EP5_30">because members we are of his body, of his flesh, and of  his bones;</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_31" data-id="EP5_31">`for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother,  and shall be joined to his wife, and they shall be -- the two  -- for one flesh;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_32" data-id="EP5_32">this secret is great, and I speak in regard to Christ and  to the assembly;</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_33" data-id="EP5_33">but ye also, every one in particular -- let each his own  wife so love as himself, and the wife -- that she may reverence  the husband.</span>
