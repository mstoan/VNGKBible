<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R27_2" data-id="R27_2">and the priests have not been able to go in unto the house  of Jehovah, because the honour of Jehovah hath filled the  house of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R27_3" data-id="R27_3">And all the sons of Israel are looking on the descending of  the fire, and the honour of Jehovah on the house, and they bow  -- faces to the earth -- on the pavement, and do obeisance, and  give thanks to Jehovah, for good, for to the age [is] His  kindness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R27_4" data-id="R27_4">And the king and all the people are sacrificing a  sacrifice before Jehovah,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R27_5" data-id="R27_5">and king Solomon sacrificeth the sacrifice of the herd,  twenty and two thousand, and of the flock, a hundred and twenty  thousand, and the king and all the people dedicate the house of  God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R27_6" data-id="R27_6">And the priests over their charges are standing, and the  Levites with instruments of the song of Jehovah -- that David  the king made, to give thanks to Jehovah, for to the age [is]  His kindness, in David's praising by their hand -- and the  priests are blowing trumpets over-against them, and all Israel  are standing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R27_7" data-id="R27_7">And Solomon sanctifieth the middle of the court that [is]  before the house of Jehovah, for he hath made there the  burnt-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings: for the  altar of brass that Solomon made hath not been able to contain  the burnt-offering, and the present, and the fat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R27_8" data-id="R27_8">And solomon maketh the feast at that time seven days, and  all Israel with him -- a very great assembly -- from the  entering in of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v R27_9" data-id="R27_9">And they make on the eighth day a restraint, because the  dedication of the altar they have made seven days, and the  feast seven days.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v R27_11" data-id="R27_11">And Solomon finisheth the house of Jehovah, and the house  of the king; and all that hath come on the heart of Solomon to  do in the house of Jehovah, and in his own house, he hath  caused to prosper.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v R27_12" data-id="R27_12">And Jehovah appeareth unto Solomon by night, and saith to  him, `I have heard thy prayer, and have fixed on this place to  Me for a house of sacrifice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v R27_13" data-id="R27_13">If I restrain the heavens and there is no rain, and if I  lay charge on the locust to consume the land, and if I send  pestilence among My people --</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v R27_14" data-id="R27_14">and My people on whom My name is called be humbled, and  pray, and seek My face, and turn back from their evil ways,  then I -- I hear from the heavens, and forgive their sin, and  heal their land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v R27_15" data-id="R27_15">`Now, Mine eyes are open, and Mine ears attentive, to the  prayer of this place;</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v R27_17" data-id="R27_17">`And thou, if thou dost walk before Me as David thy father  walked, even to do according to all that I have commanded  thee, and My statutes and My judgments dost keep --</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v R27_18" data-id="R27_18">then I have established the throne of thy kingdom, as I  covenanted with David thy father, saying, There is not cut off  a man to thee -- a ruler in Israel;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v R27_19" data-id="R27_19">and if ye turn back -- ye -- and have forsaken My statutes,  and My commands, that I have placed before you, and have gone  and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them -- then I  have plucked them from off My ground that I have given to them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v R27_20" data-id="R27_20">and this house that I have sanctified for My name, I cast  from before My face, and make it for a proverb, and for a  byword, among all the peoples.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v R27_21" data-id="R27_21">`And this house that hath been high, to every one passing  by it, is an astonishment, and he hath said, Wherefore hath  Jehovah done thus to this land, and to this house?</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v R27_22" data-id="R27_22">and they have said, Because that they have forsaken  Jehovah, God of their fathers, who brought them out from the  land of Egypt, and lay hold on other gods, and bow themselves  to them, and serve them, therefore He hath brought upon them  all this evil.'</span>
