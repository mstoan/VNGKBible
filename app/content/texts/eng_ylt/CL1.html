<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_28" data-id="CL1_28">whom we proclaim, warning every man, and teaching every  man, in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in  Christ Jesus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL1_29" data-id="CL1_29">for which also I labour, striving according to his working  that is working in me in power.</span>
