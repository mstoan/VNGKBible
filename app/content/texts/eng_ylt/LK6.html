<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK6_2" data-id="LK6_2">and certain of the Pharisees said to them, `Why do ye that  which is not lawful to do on the sabbaths?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK6_3" data-id="LK6_3">And Jesus answering said unto them, `Did ye not read even  this that David did, when he hungered, himself and those who  are with him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK6_4" data-id="LK6_4">how he went into the house of God, and the loaves of the  presentation did take, and did eat, and gave also to those  with him, which it is not lawful to eat, except only to the  priests?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK6_5" data-id="LK6_5">and he said to them, -- `The Son of Man is lord also of the  sabbath.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK6_6" data-id="LK6_6">And it came to pass also, on another sabbath, that he goeth  into the synagogue, and teacheth, and there was there a man,  and his right hand was withered,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK6_7" data-id="LK6_7">and the scribes and the Pharisees were watching him, if on  the sabbath he will heal, that they might find an accusation  against him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK6_8" data-id="LK6_8">And he himself had known their reasonings, and said to the  man having the withered hand, `Rise, and stand in the midst;'  and he having risen, stood.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK6_9" data-id="LK6_9">Then said Jesus unto them, `I will question you something:  Is it lawful on the sabbaths to do good, or to do evil? life  to save or to kill?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK6_10" data-id="LK6_10">And having looked round on them all, he said to the man,  `Stretch forth thy hand;' and he did so, and his hand was  restored whole as the other;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK6_11" data-id="LK6_11">and they were filled with madness, and were speaking with  one another what they might do to Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK6_12" data-id="LK6_12">And it came to pass in those days, he went forth to the  mountain to pray, and was passing the night in the prayer of  God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK6_13" data-id="LK6_13">and when it became day, he called near his disciples, and  having chosen from them twelve, whom also he named apostles,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK6_14" data-id="LK6_14">(Simon, whom also he named Peter, and Andrew his brother,  James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,</span>
