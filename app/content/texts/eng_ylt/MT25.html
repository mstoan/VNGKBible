<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_2" data-id="MT25_2">and five of them were prudent, and five foolish;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_3" data-id="MT25_3">they who were foolish having taken their lamps, did not  take with themselves oil;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_4" data-id="MT25_4">and the prudent took oil in their vessels, with their  lamps.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_5" data-id="MT25_5">`And the bridegroom tarrying, they all nodded and were  sleeping,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_6" data-id="MT25_6">and in the middle of the night a cry was made, Lo, the  bridegroom doth come; go ye forth to meet him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_7" data-id="MT25_7">`Then rose all those virgins, and trimmed their lamps,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_8" data-id="MT25_8">and the foolish said to the prudent, Give us of your oil,  because our lamps are going out;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_9" data-id="MT25_9">and the prudent answered, saying -- Lest there may not be  sufficient for us and you, go ye rather unto those selling, and  buy for yourselves.</span>
