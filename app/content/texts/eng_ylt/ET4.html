<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET4_2" data-id="ET4_2">and he cometh in unto the front of the gate of the king, but  none is to come in unto the gate of the king with a  sackcloth-garment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET4_3" data-id="ET4_3">And in every province and province, the place where the word  of the king, even his law, is coming, a great mourning have the  Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and lamenting: sackcloth and  ashes are spread for many.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET4_4" data-id="ET4_4">And young women of Esther come in and her eunuchs, and  declare [it] to her, and the queen is exceedingly pained, and  sendeth garments to clothe Mordecai, and to turn aside his  sackcloth from off him, and he hath not received [them].</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET4_5" data-id="ET4_5">And Esther calleth to Hatach, of the eunuchs of the king,  whom he hath stationed before her, and giveth him a charge for  Mordecai, to know what this [is], and wherefore this [is].</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET4_6" data-id="ET4_6">And Hatach goeth out unto Mordecai, unto a broad place of  the city, that [is] before the gate of the king,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET4_7" data-id="ET4_7">and Mordecai declareth to him all that hath met him, and the  explanation of the money that Haman said to weigh to the  treasuries of the king for the Jews, to destroy them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET4_8" data-id="ET4_8">and the copy of the writing of the law that had been given  in Shushan to destroy them he hath given to him, to shew  Esther, and to declare [it] to her, and to lay a charge on her  to go in unto the king, to make supplication to him, and to  seek from before him, for her people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET4_9" data-id="ET4_9">And Hatach cometh in and declareth to Esther the words of  Mordecai,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET4_10" data-id="ET4_10">and Esther speaketh to Hatach, and chargeth him for  Mordecai:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET4_11" data-id="ET4_11">`All servants of the king, and people of the provinces of  the king, do know that any man and woman, who cometh in unto  the king, unto the inner court, who is not called -- one law  [of] his [is] to put [them] to death, apart from him to whom  the king holdeth out the golden sceptre, then he hath lived;  and I -- I have not been called to come in unto the king these  thirty days.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET4_12" data-id="ET4_12">And they declare to Mordecai the words of Esther,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET4_13" data-id="ET4_13">and Mordecai speaketh to send back unto Esther: `Do not  think in thy soul to be delivered [in] the house of the king,  more than all the Jews,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET4_14" data-id="ET4_14">but if thou keep entirely silent at this time, respite and  deliverance remaineth to the Jews from another place, and thou  and the house of thy fathers are destroyed; and who knoweth  whether for a time like this thou hast come to the kingdom?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET4_15" data-id="ET4_15">And Esther speaketh to send back unto Mordecai:</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET4_16" data-id="ET4_16">`Go, gather all the Jews who are found in Shushan, and fast  for me, and do not eat nor drink three days, by night and by  day; also I and my young women do fast likewise, and so I go in  unto the king, that [is] not according to law, and when I have  perished -- I have perished.'</span>
