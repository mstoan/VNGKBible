<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v R229_27" data-id="R229_27">And Hezekiah saith to cause the burnt-offering to ascend  on the altar; and at the time the burnt-offering began -- began  the song of Jehovah, and the trumpets, even by the hands of the  instruments of David king of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v R229_28" data-id="R229_28">And all the assembly are doing obeisance, and the singers  singing, and the trumpeters blowing; the whole [is] till the  completion of the burnt-offering.</span>

<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v R229_34" data-id="R229_34">Only, the priests have become few, and have not been able  to strip the whole of the burnt-offerings, and their brethren  the Levites strengthen them till the completion of the work,  and till the priests sanctify themselves, for the Levites [are]  more upright of heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v R229_35" data-id="R229_35">And also, burnt-offerings [are] in abundance, with fat of  the peace-offerings, and with oblations for the burnt-offering;  and the service of the house of Jehovah is established,</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v R229_36" data-id="R229_36">and rejoice doth Hezekiah and all the people, because of  God's giving preparation to the people, for the thing hath been  suddenly.</span>
