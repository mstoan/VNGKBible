Or to which of My creditors  have I sold you? Lo, for your iniquities ye have been sold, And  for your transgressions Hath your mother been sent away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS50_2" data-id="IS50_2">Wherefore have I come, and there is no one? I called, and  there is none answering, Hath My hand been at all short of  redemption? And is there not in me power to deliver? Lo, by My  rebuke I dry up a sea, I make rivers a wilderness, Their fish  stinketh, for there is no water, And dieth with thirst.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS50_3" data-id="IS50_3">I clothe the heavens [with] blackness, And sackcloth I make  their covering.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS50_4" data-id="IS50_4">The Lord Jehovah hath given to me The tongue of taught  ones, To know to aid the weary [by] a word, He waketh morning  by morning, He waketh for me an ear to hear as taught ones.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS50_5" data-id="IS50_5">The Lord Jehovah opened for me the ear, And I rebelled not  -- backward I moved not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS50_6" data-id="IS50_6">My back I have given to those smiting, And my cheeks to  those plucking out, My face I hid not from shame and spitting.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS50_7" data-id="IS50_7">And the Lord Jehovah giveth help to me, Therefore I have  not been ashamed, Therefore I have set my face as a flint, And  I know that I am not ashamed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS50_8" data-id="IS50_8">Near [is] He who is justifying me, Who doth contend with  me? We stand together, who [is] mine opponent? Let him come  nigh unto me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS50_9" data-id="IS50_9">Lo, the Lord Jehovah giveth help to me, Who [is] he that  declareth me wicked? Lo, all of them as a garment wear out, A  moth doth eat them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS50_10" data-id="IS50_10">Who [is] among you, fearing Jehovah, Hearkening to the  voice of His servant, That hath walked in dark places, And  there is no brightness for him? Let him trust in the name of  Jehovah, And lean upon his God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS50_11" data-id="IS50_11">Lo, all ye kindling a fire, girding on sparks, Walk ye in  the light of your fire, And in the sparks ye have caused to  burn, From my hand hath this been to you, In grief ye lie down!</span>
