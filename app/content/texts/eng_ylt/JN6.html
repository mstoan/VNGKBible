<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_2" data-id="JN6_2">and there was following him a great multitude, because they  were seeing his signs that he was doing on the ailing;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_3" data-id="JN6_3">and Jesus went up to the mount, and he was there sitting  with his disciples,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_4" data-id="JN6_4">and the passover was nigh, the feast of the Jews.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_5" data-id="JN6_5">Jesus then having lifted up [his] eyes and having seen that  a great multitude doth come to him, saith unto Philip, `Whence  shall we buy loaves, that these may eat?' --</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_6" data-id="JN6_6">and this he said, trying him, for he himself had known what  he was about to do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_7" data-id="JN6_7">Philip answered him, `Two hundred denaries' worth of loaves  are not sufficient to them, that each of them may receive some  little;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_8" data-id="JN6_8">one of his disciples -- Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter  -- saith to him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_9" data-id="JN6_9">`There is one little lad here who hath five barley loaves,  and two fishes, but these -- what are they to so many?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_10" data-id="JN6_10">And Jesus said, `Make the men to sit down;' and there was  much grass in the place, the men then sat down, in number, as  it were, five thousand,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_11" data-id="JN6_11">and Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks he  distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those  reclining, in like manner, also of the little fishes as much  as they wished.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_12" data-id="JN6_12">And when they were filled, he saith to his disciples,  `Gather together the broken pieces that are over, that nothing  may be lost;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_13" data-id="JN6_13">they gathered together, therefore, and filled twelve  hand-baskets with broken pieces, from the five barley loaves  that were over to those having eaten.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_14" data-id="JN6_14">The men, then, having seen the sign that Jesus did, said --  `This is truly the Prophet, who is coming to the world;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_15" data-id="JN6_15">Jesus, therefore, having known that they are about to come,  and to take him by force that they may make him king, retired  again to the mountain himself alone.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_16" data-id="JN6_16">And when evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_17" data-id="JN6_17">and having entered into the boat, they were going over the  sea to Capernaum, and darkness had already come, and Jesus had  not come unto them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_18" data-id="JN6_18">the sea also -- a great wind blowing -- was being raised,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_19" data-id="JN6_19">having pushed onwards, therefore, about twenty-five or  thirty furlongs, they behold Jesus walking on the sea, and  coming nigh to the boat, and they were afraid;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_20" data-id="JN6_20">and he saith to them, `I am [he], be not afraid;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_21" data-id="JN6_21">they were willing then to receive him into the boat, and  immediately the boat came unto the land to which they were  going.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_22" data-id="JN6_22">On the morrow, the multitude that was standing on the other  side of the sea, having seen that there was no other little  boat there except one -- that into which his disciples entered  -- and that Jesus went not in with his disciples into the  little boat, but his disciples went away alone,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_23" data-id="JN6_23">(and other little boats came from Tiberias, nigh the place  where they did eat the bread, the Lord having given thanks),</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_24" data-id="JN6_24">when therefore the multitude saw that Jesus is not there,  nor his disciples, they also themselves did enter into the  boats, and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus;</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_25" data-id="JN6_25">and having found him on the other side of the sea, they  said to him, `Rabbi, when hast thou come hither?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_26" data-id="JN6_26">Jesus answered them and said, `Verily, verily, I say to  you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but because ye did  eat of the loaves, and were satisfied;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_27" data-id="JN6_27">work not for the food that is perishing, but for the food  that is remaining to life age-during, which the Son of Man  will give to you, for him did the Father seal -- [even] God.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_28" data-id="JN6_28">They said therefore unto him, `What may we do that we may  work the works of God?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_29" data-id="JN6_29">Jesus answered and said to them, `This is the work of God,  that ye may believe in him whom He did send.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_30" data-id="JN6_30">They said therefore to him, `What sign, then, dost thou,  that we may see and may believe thee? what dost thou work?</span>

<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_32" data-id="JN6_32">Jesus, therefore, said to them, `Verily, verily, I say to  you, Moses did not give you the bread out of the heaven; but my  Father doth give you the true bread out of the heaven;</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_33" data-id="JN6_33">for the bread of God is that which is coming down out of  the heaven, and giving life to the world.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_34" data-id="JN6_34">They said, therefore, unto him, `Sir, always give us this  bread.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_35" data-id="JN6_35">And Jesus said to them, `I am the bread of the life; he who  is coming unto me may not hunger, and he who is believing in  me may not thirst -- at any time;</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_36" data-id="JN6_36">but I said to you, that ye also have seen me, and ye  believe not;</span>

<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_41" data-id="JN6_41">The Jews, therefore, were murmuring at him, because he  said, `I am the bread that came down out of the heaven;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_42" data-id="JN6_42">and they said, `Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose  father and mother we have known? how then saith this one -- Out  of the heaven I have come down?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN6_43" data-id="JN6_43">Jesus answered, therefore, and said to them, `Murmur not  one with another;</span>
