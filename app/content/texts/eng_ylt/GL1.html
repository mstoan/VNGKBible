<div class="mt">Galatians</div><div class="c">1</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_1" data-id="GL1_1">Paul, an apostle -- not from men, nor through man, but  through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who did raise him  out of the dead --</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_2" data-id="GL1_2">and all the brethren with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_3" data-id="GL1_3">Grace to you, and peace from God the Father, and our Lord  Jesus Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_4" data-id="GL1_4">who did give himself for our sins, that he might deliver us  out of the present evil age, according to the will of God even  our Father,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_5" data-id="GL1_5">to whom [is] the glory to the ages of the ages. Amen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_6" data-id="GL1_6">I wonder that ye are so quickly removed from Him who did  call you in the grace of Christ to another good news;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_7" data-id="GL1_7">that is not another, except there be certain who are  troubling you, and wishing to pervert the good news of the  Christ;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_8" data-id="GL1_8">but even if we or a messenger out of heaven may proclaim  good news to you different from what we did proclaim to you --  anathema let him be!</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_9" data-id="GL1_9">as we have said before, and now say again, If any one to you  may proclaim good news different from what ye did receive --  anathema let him be!</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_10" data-id="GL1_10">for now men do I persuade, or God? or do I seek to please  men? for if yet men I did please -- Christ's servant I should  not be.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_11" data-id="GL1_11">And I make known to you, brethren, the good news that were  proclaimed by me, that it is not according to man,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_12" data-id="GL1_12">for neither did I from man receive it, nor was I taught  [it], but through a revelation of Jesus Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_13" data-id="GL1_13">for ye did hear of my behaviour once in Judaism, that  exceedingly I was persecuting the assembly of God, and wasting  it,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_14" data-id="GL1_14">and I was advancing in Judaism above many equals in age in  mine own race, being more abundantly zealous of my fathers'  deliverances,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_15" data-id="GL1_15">and when God was well pleased -- having separated me from  the womb of my mother, and having called [me] through His  grace --</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_16" data-id="GL1_16">to reveal His Son in me, that I might proclaim him good  news among the nations, immediately I conferred not with flesh  and blood,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_17" data-id="GL1_17">nor did I go up to Jerusalem unto those who were apostles  before me, but I went away to Arabia, and again returned to  Damascus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_18" data-id="GL1_18">then, after three years I went up to Jerusalem to enquire  about Peter, and remained with him fifteen days,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_19" data-id="GL1_19">and other of the apostles I did not see, except James, the  brother of the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_20" data-id="GL1_20">And the things that I write to you, lo, before God -- I lie  not;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_21" data-id="GL1_21">then I came to the regions of Syria and of Cilicia,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_22" data-id="GL1_22">and was unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea, that  [are] in Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_23" data-id="GL1_23">and only they were hearing, that `he who is persecuting us  then, doth now proclaim good news -- the faith that then he was  wasting;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_24" data-id="GL1_24">and they were glorifying God in me.</span>
