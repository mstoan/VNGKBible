<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR38_2" data-id="JR38_2">`Thus said Jehovah: He who is remaining in this city dieth,  by sword, by famine, and by pestilence, and he who is going  forth unto the Chaldeans liveth, and his soul hath been to him  for a prey, and he liveth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR38_3" data-id="JR38_3">Thus said Jehovah: This city is certainly given into the  hand of the force of the king of Babylon, and he hath captured  it.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR38_4" data-id="JR38_4">And the heads say unto the king, `Let, we pray thee, this  man be put to death, because that he is making feeble the hands  of the men of war, who are left in this city, and the hands of  all the people, by speaking unto them according to these words,  for this man is not seeking for the peace of this people, but  for its evil.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR38_5" data-id="JR38_5">And the king Zedekiah saith, `Lo, he [is] in your hand: for  the king is not able for you [in] anything.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR38_6" data-id="JR38_6">And they take Jeremiah, and cast him into the pit of  Malchiah son of the king, that [is] in the court of the prison,  and they send down Jeremiah with cords; and in the pit there is  no water, but mire, and Jeremiah sinketh in the mire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR38_7" data-id="JR38_7">And Ebed-Melech the Cushite, a eunuch who [is] in the  king's house, heareth that they have put Jeremiah into the pit;  and the king is sitting at the gate of Benjamin,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR38_8" data-id="JR38_8">and Ebed-Melech goeth forth from the king's house, and  speaketh unto the king, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR38_9" data-id="JR38_9">`My lord, O king, these men have done evil [in] all that  they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast  into the pit, and he dieth in his place because of the famine,  for there is no more bread in the city.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR38_10" data-id="JR38_10">And the king commandeth Ebed-Melech the Cushite, saying,  `Take with thee from this thirty men, and thou hast brought up  Jeremiah the prophet from the pit, before he dieth.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR38_11" data-id="JR38_11">And Ebed-Melech taketh the men with him, and entereth the  house of the king, unto the place of the treasury, and taketh  thence worn-out clouts, and worn-out rags, and sendeth them  unto Jeremiah unto the pit by cords.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR38_12" data-id="JR38_12">And Ebed-Melech the Cushite saith unto Jeremiah, `Put, I  pray thee, the worn-out clouts and rags under thine arm-holes,  at the place of the cords,' and Jeremiah doth so,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR38_13" data-id="JR38_13">and they draw out Jeremiah with cords, and bring him up  out of the pit, and Jeremiah dwelleth in the court of the  prison.</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR38_17" data-id="JR38_17">And Jeremiah saith unto Zedekiah, `Thus said Jehovah, God  of Hosts, God of Israel: If thou dost certainly go forth unto  the heads of the king of Babylon, then hath thy soul lived, and  this city is not burned with fire, yea, thou hast lived, thou  and thy house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR38_18" data-id="JR38_18">And if thou dost not go forth unto the heads of the king  of Babylon, then hath this city been given into the hand of the  Chaldeans, and they have burnt it with fire, and thou dost not  escape from their hand.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR38_19" data-id="JR38_19">And the king Zedekiah saith unto Jeremiah, `I am fearing  the Jews who have fallen unto the Chaldeans, lest they give me  into their hand, and they have insulted me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR38_20" data-id="JR38_20">And Jeremiah saith, `They do not give thee up; hearken, I  pray thee, to the voice of Jehovah, to that which I am speaking  unto thee, and it is well for thee, and thy soul doth live.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR38_21" data-id="JR38_21">`And if thou art refusing to go forth, this [is] the thing  that Jehovah hath shewn me:</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR38_22" data-id="JR38_22">That, lo, all the women who have been left in the house of  the king of Judah are brought forth unto the heads of the king  of Babylon, and lo, they are saying: Persuaded thee, and  prevailed against thee, Have thine allies, Sunk into mire have  thy feet, They have been turned backward.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR38_23" data-id="JR38_23">`And all thy wives, and thy sons, are brought forth unto  the Chaldeans, and thou dost not escape from their hand, for by  the hand of the king of Babylon thou art caught, and this city  is burnt with fire.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR38_24" data-id="JR38_24">And Zedekiah saith unto Jeremiah, `Let no man know of  these words, and thou dost not die;</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR38_25" data-id="JR38_25">and when the heads hear that I have spoken with thee, and  they have come in unto thee, and have said unto thee, Declare  to us, we pray thee, what thou didst speak unto the king, do  not hide [it] from us, and we do not put thee to death, and  what the king spake unto thee,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR38_26" data-id="JR38_26">then thou hast said unto them, I am causing my  supplication to fall before the king, not to cause me to return  to the house of Jonathan, to die there.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR38_27" data-id="JR38_27">And all the heads come in unto Jeremiah, and ask him, and  he declareth to them according to all these words that the king  commanded, and they keep silent from him, for the matter was  not heard;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR38_28" data-id="JR38_28">and Jeremiah dwelleth in the court of the prison till the  day that Jerusalem hath been captured, and he was [there] when  Jerusalem was captured.</span>
