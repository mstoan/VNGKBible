<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_2" data-id="DT29_2">And Moses calleth unto all Israel, and saith unto them, `Ye  -- ye have seen all that which Jehovah hath done before your  eyes in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants,  and to all his land;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_3" data-id="DT29_3">the great trials which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and  those great wonders;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_4" data-id="DT29_4">and Jehovah hath not given to you a heart to know, and eyes  to see, and ears to hear, till this day,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_5" data-id="DT29_5">and I cause you to go forty years in a wilderness; your  garments have not been consumed from off you, and thy shoe hath  not worn away from off thy foot;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_6" data-id="DT29_6">bread ye have not eaten, and wine and strong drink ye have  not drunk, so that ye know that I [am] Jehovah your God.</span>

<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_20" data-id="DT29_20">Jehovah is not willing to be propitious to him, for then  doth the anger of Jehovah smoke, also His zeal, against that  man, and lain down on him hath all the oath which is written in  this book, and Jehovah hath blotted out his name from under the  heavens,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_21" data-id="DT29_21">and Jehovah hath separated him for evil, out of all the  tribes of Israel, according to all the oaths of the covenant  which is written in this book of the law.</span>
