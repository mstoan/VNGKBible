<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT5_33" data-id="MT5_33">`Again, ye heard that it was said to the ancients: Thou  shalt not swear falsely, but thou shalt pay to the Lord thine  oaths;</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT5_34" data-id="MT5_34">but I -- I say to you, not to swear at all; neither by the  heaven, because it is the throne of God,</span>
