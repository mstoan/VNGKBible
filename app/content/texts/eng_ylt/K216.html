<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v K216_12" data-id="K216_12">And the king cometh in from Damascus, and the king seeth  the altar, and the king draweth near on the altar, and offereth  on it,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v K216_13" data-id="K216_13">and perfumeth his burnt-offering, and his present, and  poureth out his libation, and sprinkleth the blood of the  peace-offerings that he hath, on the altar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v K216_14" data-id="K216_14">As to the altar of brass that [is] before Jehovah -- he  bringeth [it] near from the front of the house, from between  the altar and the house of Jehovah, and putteth it on the side  of the altar, northward.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v K216_15" data-id="K216_15">And king Ahaz commandeth him -- Urijah the priest --  saying, `On the great altar perfume the burnt-offering of the  morning, and the present of the evening, and the burnt-offering  of the king, and his present, and the burnt-offering of all the  people of the land, and their present, and their libations; and  all the blood of the burnt-offering, and all the blood of the  sacrifice, on it thou dost sprinkle, and the altar of brass is  to me to inquire [by].'</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v K216_16" data-id="K216_16">And Urijah the priest doth according to all that king Ahaz  commanded.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v K216_17" data-id="K216_17">And king Ahaz cutteth off the borders of the bases, and  turneth aside from off them the laver, and the sea he hath  taken down from off the brazen oxen that [are] under it, and  putteth it on a pavement of stones.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v K216_18" data-id="K216_18">And the covered place for the sabbath that they built in  the house, and the entrance of the king without, he turned  [from] the house of Jehovah, because of the king of Asshur.</span>
