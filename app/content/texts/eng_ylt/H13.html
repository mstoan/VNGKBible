<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v H13_2" data-id="H13_2">and did send Timotheus -- our brother, and a ministrant of  God, and our  fellow-workman in the good news of the Christ --  to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v H13_3" data-id="H13_3">that no one be moved in these tribulations, for yourselves  have known that  for this we are set,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v H13_4" data-id="H13_4">for even when we were with you, we said to you beforehand,  that we are  about to suffer tribulation, as also it did come  to pass, and ye have known  [it];</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v H13_5" data-id="H13_5">because of this also, I, no longer forbearing, did send to  know your faith,  lest he who is tempting did tempt you, and in  vain might be our labour.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v H13_7" data-id="H13_7">because of this we were comforted, brethren, over you, in  all our  tribulation and necessity, through your faith,</span>
