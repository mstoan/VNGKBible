<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_2" data-id="EC6_2">A man to whom God giveth wealth, and riches, and honour, and  there is no lack to his soul of all that he desireth, and God  giveth him not power to eat of it, but a stranger eateth it;  this [is] vanity, and it [is] an evil disease.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_3" data-id="EC6_3">If a man doth beget a hundred, and live many years, and is  great, because they are the days of his years, and his soul is  not satisfied from the goodness, and also he hath not had a  grave, I have said, `Better than he [is] the untimely birth.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_4" data-id="EC6_4">For in vanity he came in, and in darkness he goeth, and in  darkness his name is covered,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_5" data-id="EC6_5">Even the sun he hath not seen nor known, more rest hath this  than that.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_6" data-id="EC6_6">And though he had lived a thousand years twice over, yet  good he hath not seen; to the same place doth not every one go?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_7" data-id="EC6_7">All the labour of man [is] for his mouth, and yet the soul  is not filled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_8" data-id="EC6_8">For what advantage [is] to the wise above the fool? What to  the poor who knoweth to walk before the living?</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_9" data-id="EC6_9">Better [is] the sight of the eyes than the going of the  soul. This also [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_10" data-id="EC6_10">What [is] that which hath been? already is its name called,  and it is known that it [is] man, and he is not able to contend  with him who is stronger than he.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_11" data-id="EC6_11">For there are many things multiplying vanity; what  advantage [is] to man?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_12" data-id="EC6_12">For who knoweth what [is] good for a man in life, the  number of the days of the life of his vanity, and he maketh  them as a shadow? for who declareth to man what is after him  under the sun?</span>
