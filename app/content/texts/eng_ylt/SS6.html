<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS6_2" data-id="SS6_2">My beloved went down to his garden, To the beds of the  spice, To delight himself in the gardens, and to gather lilies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS6_3" data-id="SS6_3">I [am] my beloved's, and my beloved [is] mine, Who is  delighting himself among the lilies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS6_4" data-id="SS6_4">Fair [art] thou, my friend, as Tirzah, Comely as Jerusalem,  Awe-inspiring as bannered hosts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS6_5" data-id="SS6_5">Turn round thine eyes from before me, Because they have made  me proud. Thy hair [is] as a row of the goats, That have shone  from Gilead,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS6_6" data-id="SS6_6">Thy teeth as a row of the lambs, That have come up from the  washing, Because all of them are forming twins, And a bereaved  one is not among them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS6_7" data-id="SS6_7">As the work of the pomegranate [is] thy temple behind thy  veil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS6_8" data-id="SS6_8">Sixty are queens, and eighty concubines, And virgins without  number.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS6_9" data-id="SS6_9">One is my dove, my perfect one, One she [is] of her mother,  The choice one she [is] of her that bare her, Daughters saw,  and pronounce her happy, Queens and concubines, and they praise  her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS6_10" data-id="SS6_10">`Who [is] this that is looking forth as morning, Fair as  the moon -- clear as the sun, Awe-inspiring as bannered hosts?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS6_11" data-id="SS6_11">Unto a garden of nuts I went down, To look on the buds of  the valley, To see whither the vine had flourished, The  pomegranates had blossomed --</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS6_12" data-id="SS6_12">I knew not my soul, It made me -- chariots of my people  Nadib.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS6_13" data-id="SS6_13">Return, return, O Shulammith! Return, return, and we look  upon thee. What do ye see in Shulammith?</span>
