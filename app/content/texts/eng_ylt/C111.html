<div class="c">11</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_1" data-id="C111_1">Followers of me become ye, as I also [am] of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_2" data-id="C111_2">And I praise you, brethren, that in all things ye remember  me, and according as I did deliver to you, the deliverances ye  keep,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_3" data-id="C111_3">and I wish you to know that of every man the head is the  Christ, and the head of a woman is the husband, and the head of  Christ is God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_4" data-id="C111_4">Every man praying or prophesying, having the head covered,  doth dishonour his head,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_5" data-id="C111_5">and every woman praying or prophesying with the head  uncovered, doth dishonour her own head, for it is one and the  same thing with her being shaven,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_6" data-id="C111_6">for if a woman is not covered -- then let her be shorn, and  if [it is] a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven -- let her  be covered;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_7" data-id="C111_7">for a man, indeed, ought not to cover the head, being the  image and glory of God, and a woman is the glory of a man,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_8" data-id="C111_8">for a man is not of a woman, but a woman [is] of a man,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_9" data-id="C111_9">for a man also was not created because of the woman, but a  woman because of the man;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_10" data-id="C111_10">because of this the woman ought to have [a token of]  authority upon the head, because of the messengers;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_11" data-id="C111_11">but neither [is] a man apart from a woman, nor a woman  apart from a man, in the Lord,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_12" data-id="C111_12">for as the woman [is] of the man, so also the man [is]  through the woman, and the all things [are] of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_13" data-id="C111_13">In your own selves judge ye; is it seemly for a woman  uncovered to pray to God?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_14" data-id="C111_14">doth not even nature itself teach you, that if a man  indeed have long hair, a dishonour it is to him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_15" data-id="C111_15">and a woman, if she have long hair, a glory it is to her,  because the hair instead of a covering hath been given to her;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_16" data-id="C111_16">and if any one doth think to be contentious, we have no  such custom, neither the assemblies of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_17" data-id="C111_17">And this declaring, I give no praise, because not for the  better, but for the worse ye come together;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_18" data-id="C111_18">for first, indeed, ye coming together in an assembly, I  hear of divisions being among you, and partly I believe [it],</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_19" data-id="C111_19">for it behoveth sects also to be among you, that those  approved may become manifest among you;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_20" data-id="C111_20">ye, then, coming together at the same place -- it is not  to eat the Lord's supper;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_21" data-id="C111_21">for each his own supper doth take before in the eating,  and one is hungry, and another is drunk;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_22" data-id="C111_22">why, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or the  assembly of God do ye despise, and shame those not having? what  may I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I do not praise!</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_23" data-id="C111_23">For I -- I received from the Lord that which also I did  deliver to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he  was delivered up, took bread,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_24" data-id="C111_24">and having given thanks, he brake, and said, `Take ye, eat  ye, this is my body, that for you is being broken; this do ye  -- to the remembrance of me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_25" data-id="C111_25">In like manner also the cup after the supping, saying,  `This cup is the new covenant in my blood; this do ye, as often  as ye may drink [it] -- to the remembrance of me;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_26" data-id="C111_26">for as often as ye may eat this bread, and this cup may  drink, the death of the Lord ye do shew forth -- till he may  come;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_27" data-id="C111_27">so that whoever may eat this bread or may drink the cup of  the Lord unworthily, guilty he shall be of the body and blood  of the Lord:</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_28" data-id="C111_28">and let a man be proving himself, and so of the bread let  him eat, and of the cup let him drink;</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_29" data-id="C111_29">for he who is eating and drinking unworthily, judgment to  himself he doth eat and drink -- not discerning the body of the  Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_30" data-id="C111_30">Because of this, among you many [are] weak and sickly, and  sleep do many;</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_31" data-id="C111_31">for if ourselves we were discerning, we would not be being  judged,</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_32" data-id="C111_32">and being judged by the Lord, we are chastened, that with  the world we may not be condemned;</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_33" data-id="C111_33">so then, my brethren, coming together to eat, for one  another wait ye;</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_34" data-id="C111_34">and if any one is hungry, at home let him eat, that to  judgment ye may not come together; and the rest, whenever I  may come, I shall arrange.</span>
