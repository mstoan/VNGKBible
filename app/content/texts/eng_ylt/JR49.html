Wherefore hath Malcam  possessed Gad? And his people in its cities have dwelt?</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR49_2" data-id="JR49_2">Therefore, lo, days are coming, An affirmation of Jehovah,  And I have sounded unto Rabbah of the sons of Ammon a shout of  battle, And it hath been for a heap -- a desolation, And her  daughters with fire are burnt, And Israel hath succeeded its  heirs, Said hath Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR49_3" data-id="JR49_3">Howl, Heshbon, for spoiled is Ai, Cry, daughters of Rabbah,  gird on sackcloth, Lament, and go to and fro by the hedges, For  Malcam into captivity doth go, His priests and his princes  together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR49_4" data-id="JR49_4">What -- dost thou boast thyself in valleys? Flowed hath thy  valley, O backsliding daughter, Who is trusting in her  treasures: Who doth come in unto me?</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR49_7" data-id="JR49_7">Concerning Edom: `Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Is wisdom no  more in Teman? Perished hath counsel from the intelligent?  Vanished hath their wisdom?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR49_8" data-id="JR49_8">Flee, turn, go deep to dwell, ye inhabitants of Dedan, For  the calamity of Esau I brought in upon him, The time I  inspected him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR49_9" data-id="JR49_9">If gatherers have come in to thee, They do not leave  gleanings, If thieves in the night, They have destroyed their  sufficiency!</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR49_10" data-id="JR49_10">For I -- I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his  secret places, And to be hidden he is not able, Spoiled [is]  his seed, and his brethren, And his neighbours, and he is not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR49_11" data-id="JR49_11">Leave thine orphans -- I do keep alive, And thy widows --  on Me trust ye,</span>

And who [is] this shepherd who standeth before Me?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR49_20" data-id="JR49_20">Therefore, hear ye the counsel of Jehovah, That He hath  counselled concerning Edom, And His devices that He hath  devised Concerning the inhabitants of Teman: Drag them out do  not little ones of the flock, Make desolate over them doth he  not their habitation?</span>

<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR49_29" data-id="JR49_29">Their tents and their flock they do take, Their curtains,  and all their vessels, And their camels, they bear away for  themselves, And they called concerning them, Fear [is] round  about.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR49_30" data-id="JR49_30">Flee, bemoan mightily, go deep to dwell, Ye inhabitants of  Hazor -- an affirmation of Jehovah, For given counsel against  you hath Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, Yea, he deviseth  against them a device.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR49_31" data-id="JR49_31">Rise ye, go up unto a nation at rest, Dwelling  confidently, an affirmation of Jehovah, It hath no two-leaved  doors nor bar, Alone they do dwell.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR49_32" data-id="JR49_32">And their camels have been for a prey, And the multitude  of their cattle for a spoil, And I have scattered them to every  wind, Who cut off the corner [of the beard], And from all its  passages I bring in their calamity, An affirmation of Jehovah.</span>
