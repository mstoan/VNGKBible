<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_2" data-id="MC6_2">Hear, O mountains, the strife of Jehovah, Ye strong ones --  foundations of earth! For a strife [is] to Jehovah, with His  people, And with Israel He doth reason.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_3" data-id="MC6_3">O My people, what have I done to thee? And what -- have I  wearied thee? Testify against Me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_4" data-id="MC6_4">For I brought thee up from the land of Egypt, And from the  house of servants I have ransomed thee, And I send before thee  Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_5" data-id="MC6_5">O My people, remember, I pray you, What counsel did Balak  king of Moab, What answer him did Balaam son of Beor, (From  Shittim unto Gilgal,) In order to know the righteous acts of  Jehovah.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_6" data-id="MC6_6">With what do I come before Jehovah? Do I bow to God Most  High? Do I come before Him with burnt-offerings? With calves --  sons of a year?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_7" data-id="MC6_7">Is Jehovah pleased with thousands of rams? With myriads of  streams of oil? Do I give my first-born [for] my transgression?  The fruit of my body [for] the sin of my soul?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_8" data-id="MC6_8">He hath declared to thee, O man, what [is] good; Yea, what  is Jehovah requiring of thee, Except -- to do judgment, and  love kindness, And lowly to walk with thy God?</span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_10" data-id="MC6_10">Are there yet [in] the house of the wicked Treasures of  wickedness, And the abhorred scanty ephah?</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_11" data-id="MC6_11">Do I reckon [it] pure with balances of wickedness? And with  a bag of deceitful stones?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_12" data-id="MC6_12">Whose rich ones have been full of violence, And its  inhabitants have spoken falsehood, And their tongue [is]  deceitful in their mouth.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_14" data-id="MC6_14">Thou -- thou eatest, and thou art not satisfied, And thy  pit [is] in thy midst, And thou removest, and dost not deliver,  And that which thou deliverest, to a sword I give.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_15" data-id="MC6_15">Thou -- thou sowest, and thou dost not reap, Thou -- thou  treadest the olive, And thou pourest not out oil, And new wine  -- and thou drinkest not wine.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_16" data-id="MC6_16">And kept habitually are the statutes of Omri, And all the  work of the house of Ahab, And ye do walk in their counsels,  For My giving thee for a desolation, And its inhabitants for a  hissing, And the reproach of My people ye do bear!</span>
