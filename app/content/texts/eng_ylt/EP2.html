<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_2" data-id="EP2_2">in which once ye did walk according to the age of this  world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of  the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_3" data-id="EP2_3">among whom also we all did walk once in the desires of our  flesh, doing the wishes of the flesh and of the thoughts, and  were by nature children of wrath -- as also the others,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_4" data-id="EP2_4">and God, being rich in kindness, because of His great love  with which He loved us,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_5" data-id="EP2_5">even being dead in the trespasses, did make us to live  together with the Christ, (by grace ye are having been saved,)</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_6" data-id="EP2_6">and did raise [us] up together, and did seat [us] together  in the heavenly [places] in Christ Jesus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_7" data-id="EP2_7">that He might show, in the ages that are coming, the  exceeding riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ  Jesus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_8" data-id="EP2_8">for by grace ye are having been saved, through faith, and  this not of you -- of God the gift,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_9" data-id="EP2_9">not of works, that no one may boast;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_10" data-id="EP2_10">for of Him we are workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to  good works, which God did before prepare, that in them we may  walk.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_11" data-id="EP2_11">Wherefore, remember, that ye [were] once the nations in the  flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that called  Circumcision in the flesh made by hands,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_12" data-id="EP2_12">that ye were at that time apart from Christ, having been  alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to  the covenants of the promise, having no hope, and without God,  in the world;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_13" data-id="EP2_13">and now, in Christ Jesus, ye being once afar off became  nigh in the blood of the Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_14" data-id="EP2_14">for he is our peace, who did make both one, and the middle  wall of the enclosure did break down,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_15" data-id="EP2_15">the enmity in his flesh, the law of the commands in  ordinances having done away, that the two he might create in  himself into one new man, making peace,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_16" data-id="EP2_16">and might reconcile both in one body to God through the  cross, having slain the enmity in it,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_17" data-id="EP2_17">and having come, he did proclaim good news -- peace to you  -- the far-off and the nigh,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_18" data-id="EP2_18">because through him we have the access -- we both -- in one  Spirit unto the Father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_19" data-id="EP2_19">Then, therefore, ye are no more strangers and foreigners,  but fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of  God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_20" data-id="EP2_20">being built upon the foundation of the apostles and  prophets, Jesus Christ himself being chief corner-[stone],</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_21" data-id="EP2_21">in whom all the building fitly framed together doth  increase to an holy sanctuary in the Lord,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_22" data-id="EP2_22">in whom also ye are builded together, for a habitation of  God in the Spirit.</span>
