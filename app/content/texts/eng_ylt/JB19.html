<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_6" data-id="JB19_6">Know now, that God turned me upside down, And His net  against me hath set round,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_7" data-id="JB19_7">Lo, I cry out -- violence, and am not answered, I cry  aloud, and there is no judgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_8" data-id="JB19_8">My way He hedged up, and I pass not over, And on my paths  darkness He placeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB19_9" data-id="JB19_9">Mine honour from off me He hath stripped, And He turneth  the crown from my head.</span>
