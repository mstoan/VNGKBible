<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_2" data-id="GN43_2">and it cometh to pass, when they have finished eating the  corn which they brought from Egypt, that their father saith  unto them, `Turn back, buy for us a little food.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_3" data-id="GN43_3">And Judah speaketh unto him, saying, `The man protesting  protested to us, saying, Ye do not see my face without your  brother [being] with you;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_4" data-id="GN43_4">if thou art sending our brother with us, we go down, and  buy for thee food,</span>

<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_6" data-id="GN43_6">And Israel saith, `Why did ye evil to me, by declaring to  the man that ye had yet a brother?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_7" data-id="GN43_7">and they say, `The man asked diligently concerning us, and  concerning our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have  ye a brother? and we declare to him according to the tenor of  these things; do we certainly know that he will say, Bring down  your brother?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_8" data-id="GN43_8">And Judah saith unto Israel his father, `Send the youth  with me, and we arise, and go, and live, and do not die, both  we, and thou, and our infants.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_9" data-id="GN43_9">I -- I am surety [for] him, from my hand thou dost require  him; if I have not brought him in unto thee, and set him before  thee -- then I have sinned against thee all the days;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_10" data-id="GN43_10">for if we had not lingered, surely now we had returned  these two times.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_22" data-id="GN43_22">and other money have we brought down in our hand to buy  food; we have not known who put our money in our bags.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_23" data-id="GN43_23">And he saith, `Peace to you, fear not: your God and the  God of your father hath given to you hidden treasure in your  bags, your money came unto me;' and he bringeth out Simeon unto  them.</span>

<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_25" data-id="GN43_25">and they prepare the present until the coming of Joseph at  noon, for they have heard that there they do eat bread.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_26" data-id="GN43_26">And Joseph cometh into the house, and they bring to him  the present which [is] in their hand, into the house, and bow  themselves to him, to the earth;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_27" data-id="GN43_27">and he asketh of them of peace, and saith, `Is your father  well? the aged man of whom ye have spoken, is he yet alive?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_28" data-id="GN43_28">and they say, `Thy servant our father [is] well, he is yet  alive;' and they bow, and do obeisance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_29" data-id="GN43_29">And he lifteth up his eyes, and seeth Benjamin his  brother, his mother's son, and saith, `Is this your young  brother, of whom ye have spoken unto me?' and he saith, `God  favour thee, my son.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_30" data-id="GN43_30">And Joseph hasteth, for his bowels have been moved for his  brother, and he seeketh to weep, and entereth the inner  chamber, and weepeth there;</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_31" data-id="GN43_31">and he washeth his face, and goeth out, and refraineth  himself, and saith, `Place bread.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_32" data-id="GN43_32">And they place for him by himself, and for them by  themselves, and for the Egyptians who are eating with him by  themselves: for the Egyptians are unable to eat bread with the  Hebrews, for it [is] an abomination to the Egyptians.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_33" data-id="GN43_33">And they sit before him, the first-born according to his  birthright, and the young one according to his youth, and the  men wonder one at another;</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN43_34" data-id="GN43_34">and he lifteth up gifts from before him unto them, and the  gift of Benjamin is five hands more than the gifts of all of  them; and they drink, yea, they drink abundantly with him.</span>
