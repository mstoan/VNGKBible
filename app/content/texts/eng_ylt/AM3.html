<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM3_2" data-id="AM3_2">Only you I have known of all families of the land, Therefore  I charge on you all your iniquities.</span>

<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM3_4" data-id="AM3_4">Roar doth a lion in a forest and prey he hath none? Give out  doth a young lion his voice from his habitation, If he hath not  caught?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM3_5" data-id="AM3_5">Doth a bird fall into a snare of the earth, And there is no  gin for it? Doth a snare go up from the ground, And prey it  captureth not?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM3_6" data-id="AM3_6">Is a trumpet blown in a city, And do people not tremble? Is  there affliction in a city, And Jehovah hath not done [it]?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM3_7" data-id="AM3_7">For the Lord Jehovah doth nothing, Except He hath revealed  His counsel unto His servants the prophets.</span>
