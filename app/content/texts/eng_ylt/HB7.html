<div class="c">7</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_1" data-id="HB7_1">For this Melchisedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most  High, who did meet Abraham turning back from the smiting of  the kings, and did bless him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_2" data-id="HB7_2">to whom also a tenth of all did Abraham divide, (first,  indeed, being interpreted, `King of righteousness,' and then  also, King of Salem, which is, King of Peace,)</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_3" data-id="HB7_3">without father, without mother, without genealogy, having  neither beginning of days nor end of life, and being made like  to the Son of God, doth remain a priest continually.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_4" data-id="HB7_4">And see how great this one [is], to whom also a tenth  Abraham the patriarch did give out of the best of the spoils,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_5" data-id="HB7_5">and those, indeed, out of the sons of Levi receiving the  priesthood, a command have to take tithes from the people  according to the law, that is, their brethren, even though  they came forth out of the loins of Abraham;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_6" data-id="HB7_6">and he who was not reckoned by genealogy of them, received  tithes from Abraham, and him having the promises he hath  blessed,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_7" data-id="HB7_7">and apart from all controversy, the less by the better is  blessed --</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_8" data-id="HB7_8">and here, indeed, men who die do receive tithes, and there  [he], who is testified to that he was living,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_9" data-id="HB7_9">and so to speak, through Abraham even Levi who is receiving  tithes, hath paid tithes,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_10" data-id="HB7_10">for he was yet in the loins of the father when Melchisedek  met him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_11" data-id="HB7_11">If indeed, then, perfection were through the Levitical  priesthood -- for the people under it had received law -- what  further need, according to the order of Melchisedek, for  another priest to arise, and not to be called according to the  order of Aaron?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_12" data-id="HB7_12">for the priesthood being changed, of necessity also, of the  law a change doth come,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_13" data-id="HB7_13">for he of whom these things are said in another tribe hath  had part, of whom no one gave attendance at the altar,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_14" data-id="HB7_14">for [it is] evident that out of Judah hath arisen our Lord,  in regard to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning  priesthood.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_15" data-id="HB7_15">And it is yet more abundantly most evident, if according to  the similitude of Melchisedek there doth arise another priest,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_16" data-id="HB7_16">who came not according to the law of a fleshly command, but  according to the power of an endless life,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_17" data-id="HB7_17">for He doth testify -- `Thou [art] a priest -- to the age,  according to the order of Melchisedek;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_18" data-id="HB7_18">for a disannulling indeed doth come of the command going  before because of its weakness, and unprofitableness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_19" data-id="HB7_19">(for nothing did the law perfect) and the bringing in of a  better hope, through which we draw nigh to God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_20" data-id="HB7_20">And inasmuch as [it is] not apart from oath, (for those  indeed apart from oath are become priests,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_21" data-id="HB7_21">and he with an oath through Him who is saying unto him,  `The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou [art] a priest -- to  the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;')</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_22" data-id="HB7_22">by so much of a better covenant hath Jesus become surety,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_23" data-id="HB7_23">and those indeed are many who have become priests, because  by death they are hindered from remaining;</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_24" data-id="HB7_24">and he, because of his remaining -- to the age, hath the  priesthood not transient,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_25" data-id="HB7_25">whence also he is able to save to the very end, those  coming through him unto God -- ever living to make intercession  for them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_26" data-id="HB7_26">For such a chief priest did become us -- kind, harmless,  undefiled, separate from the sinners, and become higher than  the heavens,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_27" data-id="HB7_27">who hath no necessity daily, as the chief priests, first  for his own sins to offer up sacrifice, then for those of the  people; for this he did once, having offered up himself;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_28" data-id="HB7_28">for the law doth appoint men chief priests, having  infirmity, but the word of the oath that [is] after the law  [appointeth] the Son -- to the age having been perfected.</span>
