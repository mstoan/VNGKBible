<div class="c">16</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_1" data-id="AC16_1">And he came to Derbe and Lystra, and lo, a certain disciple  was there, by name Timotheus son of a certain woman, a  believing Jewess, but of a father, a Greek,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_2" data-id="AC16_2">who was well testified to by the brethren in Lystra and  Iconium;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_3" data-id="AC16_3">this one did Paul wish to go forth with him, and having  taken [him], he circumcised him, because of the Jews who are in  those places, for they all knew his father -- that he was a  Greek.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_4" data-id="AC16_4">And as they were going on through the cities, they were  delivering to them the decrees to keep, that have been judged  by the apostles and the elders who [are] in Jerusalem,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_5" data-id="AC16_5">then, indeed, were the assemblies established in the faith,  and were abounding in number every day;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_6" data-id="AC16_6">and having gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia,  having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in  Asia,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_7" data-id="AC16_7">having gone toward Mysia, they were trying to go on toward  Bithynia, and the Spirit did not suffer them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_8" data-id="AC16_8">and having passed by Mysia, they came down to Troas.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_9" data-id="AC16_9">And a vision through the night appeared to Paul -- a  certain man of Macedonia was standing, calling upon him, and  saying, `Having passed through to Macedonia, help us;' --</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_10" data-id="AC16_10">and when he saw the vision, immediately we endeavoured to  go forth to Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord hath  called us to preach good news to them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_11" data-id="AC16_11">having set sail, therefore, from Troas, we came with a  straight course to Samothracia, on the morrow also to  Neapolis,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_12" data-id="AC16_12">thence also to Philippi, which is a principal city of the  part of Macedonia -- a colony. And we were in this city  abiding certain days,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_13" data-id="AC16_13">on the sabbath-day also we went forth outside of the city,  by a river, where there used to be prayer, and having sat  down, we were speaking to the women who came together,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_14" data-id="AC16_14">and a certain woman, by name Lydia, a seller of purple, of  the city of Thyatira, worshipping God, was hearing, whose  heart the Lord did open to attend to the things spoken by  Paul;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_15" data-id="AC16_15">and when she was baptized, and her household, she did call  upon us, saying, `If ye have judged me to be faithful to the  Lord, having entered into my house, remain;' and she  constrained us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_16" data-id="AC16_16">And it came to pass in our going on to prayer, a certain  maid, having a spirit of Python, did meet us, who brought much  employment to her masters by soothsaying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_17" data-id="AC16_17">she having followed Paul and us, was crying, saying,  `These men are servants of the Most High God, who declare to us  a way of salvation;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_18" data-id="AC16_18">and this she was doing for many days, but Paul having been  grieved, and having turned, said to the spirit, `I command  thee, in the name of Jesus Christ, to come forth from her;'  and it came forth the same hour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_19" data-id="AC16_19">And her masters having seen that the hope of their  employment was gone, having caught Paul and Silas, drew [them]  to the market-place, unto the rulers,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_20" data-id="AC16_20">and having brought them to the magistrates, they said,  `These men do exceedingly trouble our city, being Jews;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_21" data-id="AC16_21">and they proclaim customs that are not lawful for us to  receive nor to do, being Romans.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_22" data-id="AC16_22">And the multitude rose up together against them, and the  magistrates having torn their garments from them, were  commanding to beat [them] with rods,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_23" data-id="AC16_23">many blows also having laid upon them, they cast them to  prison, having given charge to the jailor to keep them safely,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_24" data-id="AC16_24">who such a charge having received, did put them to the  inner prison, and their feet made fast in the stocks.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_25" data-id="AC16_25">And at midnight Paul and Silas praying, were singing hymns  to God, and the prisoners were hearing them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_26" data-id="AC16_26">and suddenly a great earthquake came, so that the  foundations of the prison were shaken, opened also presently  were all the doors, and of all -- the bands were loosed;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_27" data-id="AC16_27">and the jailor having come out of sleep, and having seen  the doors of the prison open, having drawn a sword, was about  to kill himself, supposing the prisoners to be fled,</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_28" data-id="AC16_28">and Paul cried out with a loud voice, saying, `Thou mayest  not do thyself any harm, for we are all here.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_29" data-id="AC16_29">And, having asked for a light, he sprang in, and trembling  he fell down before Paul and Silas,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_30" data-id="AC16_30">and having brought them forth, said, `Sirs, what must I do  -- that I may be saved?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_31" data-id="AC16_31">and they said, `Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou  shalt be saved -- thou and thy house;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_32" data-id="AC16_32">and they spake to him the word of the Lord, and to all  those in his household;</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_33" data-id="AC16_33">and having taken them, in that hour of the night, he did  bathe [them] from the blows, and was baptized, himself and all  his presently,</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_34" data-id="AC16_34">having brought them also into his house, he set food  before [them], and was glad with all the household, he having  believed in God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_35" data-id="AC16_35">And day having come, the magistrates sent the rod-bearers,  saying, `Let those men go;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_36" data-id="AC16_36">and the jailor told these words unto Paul -- `The  magistrates have sent, that ye may be let go; now, therefore,  having gone forth go on in peace;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_37" data-id="AC16_37">and Paul said to them, `Having beaten us publicly  uncondemned -- men, Romans being -- they did cast [us] to  prison, and now privately do they cast us forth! why no! but  having come themselves, let them bring us forth.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_38" data-id="AC16_38">And the rod-bearers told to the magistrates these sayings,  and they were afraid, having heard that they are Romans,</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_39" data-id="AC16_39">and having come, they besought them, and having brought  [them] forth, they were asking [them] to go forth from the  city;</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_40" data-id="AC16_40">and they, having gone forth out of the prison, entered  into [the house of] Lydia, and having seen the brethren, they  comforted them, and went forth.</span>
