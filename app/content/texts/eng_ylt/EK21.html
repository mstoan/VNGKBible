<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK21_4" data-id="EK21_4">Because that I have cut off from thee righteous and wicked,  Therefore go out doth My sword from its scabbard, Unto all  flesh, from south to north.</span>

<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK21_21" data-id="EK21_21">For stood hath the king of Babylon at the head of the way,  At the top of the two ways, to use divination, He hath moved  lightly with the arrows, He hath asked at the teraphim, He hath  looked on the liver.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK21_22" data-id="EK21_22">At his right hath been the divination -- Jerusalem, To  place battering-rams, To open the mouth with slaughter, To lift  up a voice with shouting, To place battering-rams against the  gates, To pour out a mount, to build a fortification.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK21_23" data-id="EK21_23">And it hath been to them as a false divination in their  eyes, Who have sworn oaths to them, And he is causing iniquity  to be remembered to be caught.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK21_24" data-id="EK21_24">Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of your  causing your iniquity to be remembered, In your transgressions  being revealed, For your sins being seen, in all your doings,  Because of your being remembered, By the hand ye are caught.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK21_25" data-id="EK21_25">And thou, wounded, wicked one, Prince of Israel, whose day  hath come, In the time of the iniquity of the end!</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK21_26" data-id="EK21_26">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Turn aside the mitre, and bear  away the crown, This -- not this -- the low make high, And the  high make low.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK21_27" data-id="EK21_27">An overturn, overturn, overturn, I make it, Also this hath  not been till the coming of Him, Whose [is] the judgment, and I  have given it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK21_28" data-id="EK21_28">And thou, son of man, prophesy, and thou hast said: Thus  said the Lord Jehovah concerning the sons of Ammon, and  concerning their reproach: and thou hast said: A sword, a  sword, open for slaughter, Polished to the utmost for  brightness!</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK21_29" data-id="EK21_29">In the seeing for thee of a vain thing, In the divining  for thee of a lie, To put thee on the necks of the wounded of  the wicked, whose day hath come, In the time of the iniquity of  the end.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK21_30" data-id="EK21_30">Turn [it] back unto its scabbard, In the place where thou  wast produced, In the land of thy birth I do judge thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK21_31" data-id="EK21_31">And I have poured on thee Mine indignation, With fire of  My wrath I blow against thee, And have given thee into the hand  of brutish men -- artificers of destruction.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK21_32" data-id="EK21_32">To the fire thou art for fuel, Thy blood is in the midst  of the land, Thou art not remembered, For I, Jehovah, have  spoken!'</span>
