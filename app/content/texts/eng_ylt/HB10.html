<div class="c">10</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_1" data-id="HB10_1">For the law having a shadow of the coming good things --  not the very image of the matters, every year, by the same  sacrifices that they offer continually, is never able to make  perfect those coming near,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_2" data-id="HB10_2">since, would they not have ceased to be offered, because of  those serving having no more conscience of sins, having once  been purified?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_3" data-id="HB10_3">but in those [sacrifices] is a remembrance of sins every  year,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_4" data-id="HB10_4">for it is impossible for blood of bulls and goats to take  away sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_5" data-id="HB10_5">Wherefore, coming into the world, he saith, `Sacrifice and  offering Thou didst not will, and a body Thou didst prepare  for me,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_6" data-id="HB10_6">in burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offerings, Thou  didst not delight,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_7" data-id="HB10_7">then I said, Lo, I come, (in a volume of the book it hath  been written concerning me,) to do, O God, Thy will;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_8" data-id="HB10_8">saying above -- `Sacrifice, and offering, and  burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offering Thou didst not  will, nor delight in,' -- which according to the law are  offered --</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_9" data-id="HB10_9">then he said, `Lo, I come to do, O God, Thy will;' he doth  take away the first that the second he may establish;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_10" data-id="HB10_10">in the which will we are having been sanctified through  the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_11" data-id="HB10_11">and every priest, indeed, hath stood daily serving, and  the same sacrifices many times offering, that are never able to  take away sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_12" data-id="HB10_12">And He, for sin one sacrifice having offered -- to the  end, did sit down on the right hand of God, --</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_13" data-id="HB10_13">as to the rest, expecting till He may place his enemies  [as] his footstool,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_14" data-id="HB10_14">for by one offering he hath perfected to the end those  sanctified;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_15" data-id="HB10_15">and testify to us also doth the Holy Spirit, for after  that He hath said before,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_16" data-id="HB10_16">`This [is] the covenant that I will make with them after  those days, saith the Lord, giving My laws on their hearts, and  upon their minds I will write them,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_17" data-id="HB10_17">and `their sins and their lawlessness I will remember no  more;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_18" data-id="HB10_18">and where forgiveness of these [is], there is no more  offering for sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_19" data-id="HB10_19">Having, therefore, brethren, boldness for the entrance  into the holy places, in the blood of Jesus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_20" data-id="HB10_20">which way he did initiate for us -- new and living,  through the vail, that is, his flesh --</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_21" data-id="HB10_21">and a high priest over the house of God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_22" data-id="HB10_22">may we draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of  faith, having the hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience,  and having the body bathed with pure water;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_23" data-id="HB10_23">may we hold fast the unwavering profession of the hope,  (for faithful [is] He who did promise),</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_24" data-id="HB10_24">and may we consider one another to provoke to love and to  good works,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_25" data-id="HB10_25">not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as a  custom of certain [is], but exhorting, and so much the more as  ye see the day coming nigh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_26" data-id="HB10_26">For we -- willfully sinning after the receiving the full  knowledge of the truth -- no more for sins doth there remain a  sacrifice,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_27" data-id="HB10_27">but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery  zeal, about to devour the opposers;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_28" data-id="HB10_28">any one who did set at nought a law of Moses, apart from  mercies, by two or three witnesses, doth die,</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_29" data-id="HB10_29">of how much sorer punishment shall he be counted worthy  who the Son of God did trample on, and the blood of the  covenant did count a common thing, in which he was sanctified,  and to the Spirit of the grace did despite?</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_30" data-id="HB10_30">for we have known Him who is saying, `Vengeance [is] Mine,  I will recompense, saith the Lord;' and again, `The Lord shall  judge His people;' --</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_31" data-id="HB10_31">fearful [is] the falling into the hands of a living God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_32" data-id="HB10_32">And call to your remembrance the former days, in which,  having been enlightened, ye did endure much conflict of  sufferings,</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_33" data-id="HB10_33">partly both with reproaches and tribulations being made  spectacles, and partly having become partners of those so  living,</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_34" data-id="HB10_34">for also with my bonds ye sympathised, and the robbery of  your goods with joy ye did receive, knowing that ye have in  yourselves a better substance in the heavens, and an enduring  one.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_35" data-id="HB10_35">Ye may not cast away, then, your boldness, which hath  great recompense of reward,</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_36" data-id="HB10_36">for of patience ye have need, that the will of God having  done, ye may receive the promise,</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_37" data-id="HB10_37">for yet a very very little, He who is coming will come,  and will not tarry;</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_38" data-id="HB10_38">and `the righteous by faith shall live,' and `if he may  draw back, My soul hath no pleasure in him,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_39" data-id="HB10_39">and we are not of those drawing back to destruction, but  of those believing to a preserving of soul.</span>
