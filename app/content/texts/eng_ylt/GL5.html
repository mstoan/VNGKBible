<div class="c">5</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_1" data-id="GL5_1">In the freedom, then, with which Christ did make you free --  stand ye, and be not held fast again by a yoke of servitude;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_2" data-id="GL5_2">lo, I Paul do say to you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ  shall profit you nothing;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_3" data-id="GL5_3">and I testify again to every man circumcised, that he is a  debtor to do the whole law;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_4" data-id="GL5_4">ye were freed from the Christ, ye who in law are declared  righteous; from the grace ye fell away;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_5" data-id="GL5_5">for we by the Spirit, by faith, a hope of righteousness do  wait for,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_6" data-id="GL5_6">for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything,  nor uncircumcision, but faith through love working.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_7" data-id="GL5_7">Ye were running well; who did hinder you -- not to obey the  truth?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_8" data-id="GL5_8">the obedience [is] not of him who is calling you!</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_9" data-id="GL5_9">a little leaven the whole lump doth leaven;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_10" data-id="GL5_10">I have confidence in regard to you in the Lord, that ye  will be none otherwise minded; and he who is troubling you  shall bear the judgment, whoever he may be.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_11" data-id="GL5_11">And I, brethren, if uncircumcision I yet preach, why yet am  I persecuted? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been  done away;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_12" data-id="GL5_12">O that even they would cut themselves off who are  unsettling you!</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_13" data-id="GL5_13">For ye -- to freedom ye were called, brethren, only not the  freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through the love  serve ye one another,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_14" data-id="GL5_14">for all the law in one word is fulfilled -- in this: `Thou  shalt love thy neighbor as thyself;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_15" data-id="GL5_15">and if one another ye do bite and devour, see -- that ye  may not by one another be consumed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_16" data-id="GL5_16">And I say: In the Spirit walk ye, and the desire of the  flesh ye may not complete;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_17" data-id="GL5_17">for the flesh doth desire contrary to the Spirit, and the  Spirit contrary to the flesh, and these are opposed one to  another, that the things that ye may will -- these ye may not  do;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_18" data-id="GL5_18">and if by the Spirit ye are led, ye are not under law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_19" data-id="GL5_19">And manifest also are the works of the flesh, which are:  Adultery, whoredom, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_20" data-id="GL5_20">idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, strifes, emulations, wraths,  rivalries, dissensions, sects,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_21" data-id="GL5_21">envyings, murders, drunkennesses, revellings, and such  like, of which I tell you before, as I also said before, that  those doing such things the reign of God shall not inherit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_22" data-id="GL5_22">And the fruit of the Spirit is: Love, joy, peace,  long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_23" data-id="GL5_23">meekness, temperance: against such there is no law;</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_24" data-id="GL5_24">and those who are Christ's, the flesh did crucify with the  affections, and the desires;</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_25" data-id="GL5_25">if we may live in the Spirit, in the Spirit also we may  walk;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_26" data-id="GL5_26">let us not become vain-glorious -- one another provoking,  one another envying!</span>
