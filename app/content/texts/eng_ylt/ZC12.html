<div class="c">12</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_1" data-id="ZC12_1">The burden of a word of Jehovah on Israel. An affirmation  of Jehovah, Stretching out heaven, and founding earth, And  forming the spirit of man in his midst.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_2" data-id="ZC12_2">Lo, I am making Jerusalem a cup of reeling To all the  peoples round about, And also against Judah it is, In the siege  against Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_3" data-id="ZC12_3">And it hath come to pass, in that day, I make Jerusalem a  burdensome stone to all the peoples, All loading it are  completely pressed down, And gathered against it have been all  nations of the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_4" data-id="ZC12_4">In that day -- an affirmation of Jehovah, I do smite every  horse with astonishment, And its rider with madness, And on the  house of Judah I open My eyes, And every horse of the peoples I  smite with blindness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_5" data-id="ZC12_5">And leaders of Judah have said in their heart, `Strength to  me [are] the inhabitants of Jerusalem, In Jehovah of Hosts  their God.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_6" data-id="ZC12_6">In that day I make the leaders of Judah As a hearth of fire  among trees, And as a torch of fire in a sheaf, And they have  consumed -- on the right and on the left -- all the peoples  round about, And Jerusalem hath inhabited again her place in  Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_7" data-id="ZC12_7">And saved hath Jehovah the tents of Judah first, So that  become not great against Judah Doth the beauty of the house of  David, And the beauty of the inhabitant of Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_8" data-id="ZC12_8">In that day cover over doth Jehovah the inhabitant of  Jerusalem, And the stumbling among them hath been in that day  as David, And the house of David as God -- As a messenger of  Jehovah -- before them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_9" data-id="ZC12_9">And it hath come to pass, in that day, I seek to destroy  all the nations Who are coming in against Jerusalem,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_10" data-id="ZC12_10">And I have poured on the house of David, And on the  inhabitant of Jerusalem, A spirit of grace and supplications,  And they have looked unto Me whom they pierced, And they have  mourned over it, Like a mourning over the only one, And they  have been in bitterness for it, Like a bitterness over the  first-born.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_11" data-id="ZC12_11">In that day, great is the mourning of Jerusalem, As the  mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_12" data-id="ZC12_12">And mourned hath the land -- every family apart, The  family of the house of David apart, And their women apart; The  family of the house of Nathan apart, And their women apart;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_13" data-id="ZC12_13">The family of the house of Levi apart, And their women  apart; The family of Shimei apart, And their women apart,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_14" data-id="ZC12_14">All the families that are left, Every family apart, and  their women apart!</span>
