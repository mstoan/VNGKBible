<div class="c">21</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_1" data-id="MT21_1">And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, and came to  Bethphage, unto the mount of the Olives, then Jesus sent two  disciples,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_2" data-id="MT21_2">saying to them, `Go on to the village over-against you, and  immediately ye shall find an ass bound, and a colt with her --  having loosed, bring ye to me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_3" data-id="MT21_3">and if any one may say anything to you, ye shall say, that  the lord hath need of them, and immediately he will send them.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_4" data-id="MT21_4">And all this came to pass, that it might be fulfilled that  was spoken through the prophet, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_5" data-id="MT21_5">`Tell ye the daughter of Zion, Lo, thy king doth come to  thee, meek, and mounted on an ass, and a colt, a foal of a  beast of burden.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_6" data-id="MT21_6">And the disciples having gone and having done as Jesus  commanded them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_7" data-id="MT21_7">brought the ass and the colt, and did put on them their  garments, and set [him] upon them;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_8" data-id="MT21_8">and the very great multitude spread their own garments in  the way, and others were cutting branches from the trees, and  were strewing in the way,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_9" data-id="MT21_9">and the multitudes who were going before, and who were  following, were crying, saying, `Hosanna to the Son of David,  blessed is he who is coming in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in  the highest.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_10" data-id="MT21_10">And he having entered into Jerusalem, all the city was  moved, saying, `Who is this?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_11" data-id="MT21_11">And the multitudes said, `This is Jesus the prophet, who  [is] from Nazareth of Galilee.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_12" data-id="MT21_12">And Jesus entered into the temple of God, and did cast  forth all those selling and buying in the temple, and the  tables of the money-changers he overturned, and the seats of  those selling the doves,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_13" data-id="MT21_13">and he saith to them, `It hath been written, My house a  house of prayer shall be called, but ye did make it a den of  robbers.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_14" data-id="MT21_14">And there came to him blind and lame men in the temple,  and he healed them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_15" data-id="MT21_15">and the chief priests and the scribes having seen the  wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the  temple, and saying, `Hosanna to the Son of David,' were much  displeased;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_16" data-id="MT21_16">and they said to him, `Hearest thou what these say?' And  Jesus saith to them, `Yes, did ye never read, that, Out of the  mouth of babes and sucklings Thou didst prepare praise?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_17" data-id="MT21_17">And having left them, he went forth out of the city to  Bethany, and did lodge there,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_18" data-id="MT21_18">and in the morning turning back to the city, he hungered,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_19" data-id="MT21_19">and having seen a certain fig-tree on the way, he came to  it, and found nothing in it except leaves only, and he saith to  it, `No more from thee may fruit be -- to the age;' and  forthwith the fig-tree withered.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_20" data-id="MT21_20">And the disciples having seen, did wonder, saying, `How  did the fig-tree forthwith wither?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_21" data-id="MT21_21">And Jesus answering said to them, `Verily I say to you, If  ye may have faith, and may not doubt, not only this of the  fig-tree shall ye do, but even if to this mount ye may say, Be  lifted up and be cast into the sea, it shall come to pass;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_22" data-id="MT21_22">and all -- as much as ye may ask in the prayer, believing,  ye shall receive.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_23" data-id="MT21_23">And he having come to the temple, there came to him when  teaching the chief priests and the elders of the people,  saying, `By what authority dost thou do these things? and who  gave thee this authority?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_24" data-id="MT21_24">And Jesus answering said to them, `I will ask you -- I  also -- one word, which if ye may tell me, I also will tell you  by what authority I do these things;</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_25" data-id="MT21_25">the baptism of John, whence was it? -- from heaven, or  from men?' And they were reasoning with themselves, saying, `If  we should say, From heaven; he will say to us, Wherefore, then,  did ye not believe him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_26" data-id="MT21_26">and if we should say, From men, we fear the multitude, for  all hold John as a prophet.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_27" data-id="MT21_27">And answering Jesus they said, `We have not known.' He  said to them -- he also -- `Neither do I tell you by what  authority I do these things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_28" data-id="MT21_28">`And what think ye? A man had two children, and having  come to the first, he said, Child, go, to-day be working in my  vineyard.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_29" data-id="MT21_29">And he answering said, `I will not,' but at last, having  repented, he went.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_30" data-id="MT21_30">`And having come to the second, he said in the same  manner, and he answering said, I [go], sir, and went not;</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_31" data-id="MT21_31">which of the two did the will of the father?' They say to  him, `The first.' Jesus saith to them, `Verily I say to you,  that the tax-gatherers and the harlots do go before you into  the reign of God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_32" data-id="MT21_32">for John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye  did not believe him, and the tax-gatherers and the harlots did  believe him, and ye, having seen, repented not at last -- to  believe him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_33" data-id="MT21_33">`Hear ye another simile: There was a certain man, a  householder, who planted a vineyard, and did put a hedge round  it, and digged in it a wine-press, and built a tower, and gave  it out to husbandmen, and went abroad.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_34" data-id="MT21_34">`And when the season of the fruits came nigh, he sent his  servants unto the husbandmen, to receive the fruits of it,</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_35" data-id="MT21_35">and the husbandmen having taken his servants, one they  scourged, and one they killed, and one they stoned.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_36" data-id="MT21_36">`Again he sent other servants more than the first, and  they did to them in the same manner.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_37" data-id="MT21_37">`And at last he sent unto them his son, saying, They will  reverence my son;</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_38" data-id="MT21_38">and the husbandmen having seen the son, said among  themselves, This is the heir, come, we may kill him, and may  possess his inheritance;</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_39" data-id="MT21_39">and having taken him, they cast [him] out of the vineyard,  and killed him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_40" data-id="MT21_40">whenever therefore the lord of the vineyard may come, what  will he do to these husbandmen?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_41" data-id="MT21_41">They say to him, `Evil men -- he will evilly destroy them,  and the vineyard will give out to other husbandmen, who will  give back to him the fruits in their seasons.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_42" data-id="MT21_42">Jesus saith to them, `Did ye never read in the Writings, A  stone that the builders disallowed, it became head of a corner;  from the Lord hath this come to pass, and it is wonderful in  our eyes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_43" data-id="MT21_43">`Because of this I say to you, that the reign of God shall  be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth its  fruit;</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_44" data-id="MT21_44">and he who is falling on this stone shall be broken, and  on whomsoever it may fall it will crush him to pieces.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_45" data-id="MT21_45">And the chief priests and the Pharisees having heard his  similes, knew that of them he speaketh,</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT21_46" data-id="MT21_46">and seeking to lay hold on him, they feared the multitudes,  seeing they were holding him as a prophet.</span>
