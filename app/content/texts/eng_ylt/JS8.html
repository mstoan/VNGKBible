<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_2" data-id="JS8_2">and thou hast done to Ai and to her king as thou hast done  to Jericho and to her king; only, its spoil and its cattle ye  spoil for yourselves; set for thee an ambush for the city at  its rear.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_3" data-id="JS8_3">And Joshua riseth, and all the people of war, to go up to  Ai, and Joshua chooseth thirty thousand men, mighty ones of  valour, and sendeth them away by night,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_4" data-id="JS8_4">and commandeth them, saying, `See, ye are liers in wait  against the city, at the rear of the city, ye go not very far  off from the city, and all of you have been prepared,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_5" data-id="JS8_5">and I and all the people who [are] with me draw near unto  the city, and it hath come to pass when they come out to meet  us as at the first, and we have fled before them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_6" data-id="JS8_6">and they have come out after us till we have drawn them out  of the city, for they say, They are fleeing before us as at the  first, and we have fled before them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_7" data-id="JS8_7">and ye rise from the ambush, and have occupied the city, and  Jehovah your God hath given it into your hand;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_8" data-id="JS8_8">and it hath been, when ye capture the city, ye burn the city  with fire, according to the word of Jehovah ye do, see, I have  commanded you.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_9" data-id="JS8_9">And Joshua sendeth them away, and they go unto the ambush,  and abide between Bethel and Ai, on the west of Ai; and Joshua  lodgeth on that night in the midst of the people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_10" data-id="JS8_10">And Joshua riseth early in the morning, and inspecteth the  people, and goeth up, he and the elders of Israel, before the  people to Ai;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_11" data-id="JS8_11">and all the people of war who [are] with him have gone up,  and draw nigh and come in over-against the city, and encamp on  the north of Ai; and the valley [is] between him and Ai.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_12" data-id="JS8_12">And he taketh about five thousand men, and setteth them an  ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west of the city;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_13" data-id="JS8_13">and they set the people, all the camp which [is] on the  north of the city, and its rear on the west of the city, and  Joshua goeth on that night into the midst of the valley.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_14" data-id="JS8_14">And it cometh to pass, when the king of Ai seeth [it], that  hasten, and rise early, and go out do the men of the city to  meet Israel for battle, he and all his people, at the appointed  season, at the front of the plain, and he hath not known that  an ambush [is] against him, on the rear of the city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_15" data-id="JS8_15">And Joshua and all Israel [seem] stricken before them, and  flee the way of the wilderness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_16" data-id="JS8_16">and all the people who [are] in the city are called to  pursue after them, and they pursue after Joshua, and are drawn  away out of the city,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_17" data-id="JS8_17">and there hath not been left a man in Ai and Bethel who  hath not gone out after Israel, and they leave the city open,  and pursue after Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_18" data-id="JS8_18">And Jehovah saith unto Joshua, `Stretch out with the  javelin which [is] in thy hand towards Ai, for into thy hand I  give it;' and Joshua stretcheth out with the javelin which [is]  in his hand toward the city,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_19" data-id="JS8_19">and the ambush hath risen [with] haste, out of its place,  and they run at the stretching out of his hand, and go into the  city, and capture it, and hasten, and burn the city with fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_20" data-id="JS8_20">And the men of Ai look behind them, and see, and lo, the  smoke of the city hath gone up unto the heavens, and there hath  not been in them power to flee hither and thither -- and the  people who are fleeing to the wilderness have turned against  the pursuer, --</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_21" data-id="JS8_21">and Joshua and all Israel have seen that the ambush hath  captured the city, and that the smoke of the city hath gone up,  and they turn back and smite the men of Ai;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_22" data-id="JS8_22">and these have come out from the city to meet them, and  they are in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on  that, and they smite them till he hath not left to them a  remnant and escaped one;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_23" data-id="JS8_23">and the king of Ai they caught alive, and bring him near  unto Joshua.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_24" data-id="JS8_24">And it cometh to pass, at Israel's finishing to slay all  the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which  they pursued them (and they fall all of them by the mouth of  the sword till their consumption), that all Israel turn back to  Ai, and smite it by the mouth of the sword;</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_25" data-id="JS8_25">and all who fall during the day, of men and of women, are  twelve thousand -- all men of Ai.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_26" data-id="JS8_26">And Joshua hath not brought back his hand which he  stretched out with the javelin till that he hath devoted all  the inhabitants of Ai;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_27" data-id="JS8_27">only, the cattle and the spoil of that city have Israel  spoiled for themselves, according to the word of Jehovah which  He commanded Joshua.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_28" data-id="JS8_28">And Joshua burneth Ai, and maketh it a heap age-during -- a  desolation unto this day;</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_29" data-id="JS8_29">and the king of Ai he hath hanged on the tree till  even-time, and at the going in of the sun hath Joshua  commanded, and they take down his carcase from the tree, and  cast it unto the opening of the gate of the city, and raise  over it a great heap of stones till this day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_30" data-id="JS8_30">Then doth Joshua build an altar to Jehovah, God of Israel,  in mount Ebal,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_31" data-id="JS8_31">as Moses, servant of Jehovah, commanded the sons of Israel,  as it is written in the book of the law of Moses -- an altar of  whole stones, over which he hath not waved iron -- and they  cause to go up upon it burnt-offerings to Jehovah, and  sacrifice peace-offerings;</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_32" data-id="JS8_32">and he writeth there on the stones the copy of the law of  Moses, which he hath written in the presence of the sons of  Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_33" data-id="JS8_33">And all Israel, and its elders, and authorities, and its  judges, are standing on this side and on that of the ark,  over-against the priests, the Levites, bearing the ark of the  covenant of Jehovah, as well the sojourner as the native, half  of them over-against mount Gerizim, and the half of them  over-against mount Ebal, as Moses servant of Jehovah commanded  to bless the people of Israel at the first.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_34" data-id="JS8_34">And afterwards he hath proclaimed all the words of the law,  the blessing and the reviling, according to all that is written  in the book of the law;</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS8_35" data-id="JS8_35">there hath not been a thing of all that Moses commanded  which Joshua hath not proclaimed before all the assembly of  Israel, and the women, and the infants, and the sojourner who  is going in their midst.</span>
