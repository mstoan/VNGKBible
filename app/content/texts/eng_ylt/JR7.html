<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_2" data-id="JR7_2">Stand in the gate of the house of Jehovah, and thou hast  proclaimed there this word, and hast said, Hear a word of  Jehovah, all ye of Judah, who are coming in at these gates, to  bow before Jehovah:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_3" data-id="JR7_3">Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, Amend your ways,  and your doings, And I cause you to dwell in this place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_4" data-id="JR7_4">Do not trust for yourselves Unto the words of falsehood,  saying, The temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah, The  temple of Jehovah [are] they!</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_5" data-id="JR7_5">For, if ye do thoroughly amend your ways and your doings, If  ye do judgment thoroughly Between a man and his neighbour,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_6" data-id="JR7_6">Sojourner, fatherless, and widow, ye oppress not, And  innocent blood do not shed in this place, And after other gods  do not walk, for evil to yourselves,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_7" data-id="JR7_7">Then I have caused you to dwell in this place, In the land  that I gave to your fathers, From age even unto age.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_8" data-id="JR7_8">Lo, ye are trusting for yourselves On the words of  falsehood, so as not to profit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_9" data-id="JR7_9">Stealing, murdering, and committing adultery, And swearing  to falsehood, and giving perfume to Baal, And going after other  gods whom ye knew not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_10" data-id="JR7_10">And ye have come in and stood before Me, In this house on  which My name is called, And have said, `We have been  delivered,' In order to do all these abominations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_11" data-id="JR7_11">A den of burglars hath this house, On which My name is  called, been in your eyes? Even I, lo, I have seen, an  affirmation of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_12" data-id="JR7_12">But go ye, I pray you, Unto My place that [is] in Shiloh,  Where I caused My name to dwell at first, And see that which I  have done to it, For the wickedness of My people Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_13" data-id="JR7_13">And now, because of your doing all these works, An  affirmation of Jehovah, And I speak unto you, rising early and  speaking, And ye have not hearkened, And I call you, and ye  have not answered,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_14" data-id="JR7_14">I also to the house on which My name is called, In which ye  are trusting, And to the place that I gave to you, and to your  fathers, Have done, as I have done to Shiloh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_15" data-id="JR7_15">And I have cast you from before My face, As I have cast out  all your brethren, The whole seed of Ephraim.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_16" data-id="JR7_16">And thou dost not pray for this people, Nor lift up for  them crying and prayer, Nor intercede with Me, for I hear thee  not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_17" data-id="JR7_17">Art thou not seeing what they are doing In cities of Judah,  and in streets of Jerusalem?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_18" data-id="JR7_18">The sons are gathering wood, And the fathers are causing  the fire to burn, And the women are kneading dough, To make  cakes to the queen of the heavens, And to pour out libations to  other gods, So as to provoke Me to anger.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_19" data-id="JR7_19">Me are they provoking to anger? an affirmation of Jehovah,  Is it not themselves, For the shame of their own faces?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_20" data-id="JR7_20">Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah, Lo, Mine anger and  My fury is poured out on this place, On man, and beast, and on  tree of the field, And on fruit of the ground, And it hath  burned, and it is not quenched.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_21" data-id="JR7_21">Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, Your  burnt-offerings add to your sacrifices, And eat ye flesh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_22" data-id="JR7_22">For I did not speak with your fathers, Nor did I command  them in the day of My bringing them out of the land of Egypt,  Concerning the matters of burnt-offering and sacrifice,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_23" data-id="JR7_23">But this thing I commanded them, saying: Hearken to My  voice, And I have been to you for God, And ye -- ye are to Me  for a people, And have walked in all the way that I command  you, So that it is well for you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_24" data-id="JR7_24">And they have not hearkened, nor inclined their ear, And  they walk in the counsels, In the stubbornness, of their evil  heart, And are for backward, and not for forward.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_25" data-id="JR7_25">Even from the day when your fathers Went out of the land of  Egypt till this day, I send to you all my servants the  prophets, Daily rising early and sending,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_26" data-id="JR7_26">And they have not hearkened unto Me, Nor inclined their  ear, and harden their neck, They have done evil above their  fathers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_27" data-id="JR7_27">And thou hast spoken unto them all these words, And they do  not hearken to thee, And thou hast called unto them, And they  do not answer thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_28" data-id="JR7_28">And thou hast said unto them: This [is] the nation that  hath not hearkened, To the voice of Jehovah its God, Nor have  they accepted instruction, Perished hath stedfastness, Yea, it  hath been cut off from their mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_29" data-id="JR7_29">Cut off thy crown, and cast [it] away, And lift up on high  places lamentation, For Jehovah hath rejected, And He leaveth  the generation of His wrath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_30" data-id="JR7_30">For the sons of Judah Have done the evil thing in Mine  eyes, An affirmation of Jehovah, They have set their  abominations in the house On which My name is called -- to  defile it,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_31" data-id="JR7_31">And have built the high places of Tophet, That [are] in the  valley of the son of Hinnom, To burn their sons and their  daughters with fire, Which I did not command, Nor did it come  up on My heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_32" data-id="JR7_32">Therefore, lo, days are coming, An affirmation of Jehovah,  And it is not said any more, `The Tophet,' And `Valley of the  son of Hinnom,' But `Valley of the slaughter,' And they have  buried in Tophet -- without place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_33" data-id="JR7_33">And the carcase of this people hath been for food To a fowl  of the heavens, and to a beast of the earth, And there is none  troubling.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR7_34" data-id="JR7_34">And I have caused to cease from cities of Judah, And from  streets of Jerusalem, The voice of joy, and the voice of  gladness, Voice of bridegroom, and voice of bride, For the land  doth become a desolation!</span>
