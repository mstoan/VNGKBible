<div class="c">11</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_1" data-id="RM11_1">I say, then, Did God cast away His people? let it not be!  for I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the  tribe of Benjamin:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_2" data-id="RM11_2">God did not cast away His people whom He knew before; have  ye not known -- in Elijah -- what the Writing saith? how he  doth plead with God concerning Israel, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_3" data-id="RM11_3">`Lord, Thy prophets they did kill, and Thy altars they dug  down, and I was left alone, and they seek my life;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_4" data-id="RM11_4">but what saith the divine answer to him? `I left to Myself  seven thousand men, who did not bow a knee to Baal.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_5" data-id="RM11_5">So then also in the present time a remnant according to the  choice of grace there hath been;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_6" data-id="RM11_6">and if by grace, no more of works, otherwise the grace  becometh no more grace; and if of works, it is no more grace,  otherwise the work is no more work.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_7" data-id="RM11_7">What then? What Israel doth seek after, this it did not  obtain, and the chosen did obtain, and the rest were hardened,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_8" data-id="RM11_8">according as it hath been written, `God gave to them a  spirit of deep sleep, eyes not to see, and ears not to hear,'  -- unto this very day,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_9" data-id="RM11_9">and David saith, `Let their table become for a snare, and  for a trap, and for a stumbling-block, and for a recompense to  them;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_10" data-id="RM11_10">let their eyes be darkened -- not to behold, and their  back do Thou always bow down.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_11" data-id="RM11_11">I say, then, Did they stumble that they might fall? let it  not be! but by their fall the salvation [is] to the nations,  to arouse them to jealousy;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_12" data-id="RM11_12">and if the fall of them [is] the riches of a world, and  the diminution of them the riches of nations, how much more  the fulness of them?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_13" data-id="RM11_13">For to you I speak -- to the nations -- inasmuch as I am  indeed an apostle of nations, my ministration I do glorify;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_14" data-id="RM11_14">if by any means I shall arouse to jealousy mine own flesh,  and shall save some of them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_15" data-id="RM11_15">for if the casting away of them [is] a reconciliation of  the world, what the reception -- if not life out of the dead?</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_16" data-id="RM11_16">and if the first-fruit [is] holy, the lump also; and if  the root [is] holy, the branches also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_17" data-id="RM11_17">And if certain of the branches were broken off, and thou,  being a wild olive tree, wast graffed in among them, and a  fellow-partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive  tree didst become --</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_18" data-id="RM11_18">do not boast against the branches; and if thou dost boast,  thou dost not bear the root, but the root thee!</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_19" data-id="RM11_19">Thou wilt say, then, `The branches were broken off, that I  might be graffed in;' right!</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_20" data-id="RM11_20">by unbelief they were broken off, and thou hast stood by  faith; be not high-minded, but be fearing;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_21" data-id="RM11_21">for if God the natural branches did not spare -- lest  perhaps He also shall not spare thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_22" data-id="RM11_22">Lo, then, goodness and severity of God -- upon those  indeed who fell, severity; and upon thee, goodness, if thou  mayest remain in the goodness, otherwise, thou also shalt be  cut off.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_23" data-id="RM11_23">And those also, if they may not remain in unbelief, shall  be graffed in, for God is able again to graff them in;</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_24" data-id="RM11_24">for if thou, out of the olive tree, wild by nature, wast  cut out, and, contrary to nature, wast graffed into a good  olive tree, how much rather shall they, who [are] according to  nature, be graffed into their own olive tree?</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_25" data-id="RM11_25">For I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, of this  secret -- that ye may not be wise in your own conceits -- that  hardness in part to Israel hath happened till the fulness of  the nations may come in;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_26" data-id="RM11_26">and so all Israel shall be saved, according as it hath  been written, `There shall come forth out of Sion he who is  delivering, and he shall turn away impiety from Jacob,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_27" data-id="RM11_27">and this to them [is] the covenant from Me, when I may  take away their sins.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_28" data-id="RM11_28">As regards, indeed, the good tidings, [they are] enemies  on your account; and as regards the choice -- beloved on  account of the fathers;</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_29" data-id="RM11_29">for unrepented of [are] the gifts and the calling of God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_30" data-id="RM11_30">for as ye also once did not believe in God, and now did  find kindness by the unbelief of these:</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_31" data-id="RM11_31">so also these now did not believe, that in your kindness  they also may find kindness;</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_32" data-id="RM11_32">for God did shut up together the whole to unbelief, that  to the whole He might do kindness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_33" data-id="RM11_33">O depth of riches, and wisdom and knowledge of God! how  unsearchable His judgments, and untraceable His ways!</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_34" data-id="RM11_34">for who did know the mind of the Lord? or who did become  His counsellor?</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_35" data-id="RM11_35">or who did first give to Him, and it shall be given back  to him again?</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_36" data-id="RM11_36">because of Him, and through Him, and to Him [are] the all  things; to Him [is] the glory -- to the ages. Amen.</span>
