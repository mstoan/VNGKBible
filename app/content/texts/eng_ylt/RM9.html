<div class="c">9</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_1" data-id="RM9_1">Truth I say in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing  testimony with me in the Holy Spirit,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_2" data-id="RM9_2">that I have great grief and unceasing pain in my heart --</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_3" data-id="RM9_3">for I was wishing, I myself, to be anathema from the Christ  -- for my brethren, my kindred, according to the flesh,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_4" data-id="RM9_4">who are Israelites, whose [is] the adoption, and the glory,  and the covenants, and the lawgiving, and the service, and the  promises,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_5" data-id="RM9_5">whose [are] the fathers, and of whom [is] the Christ,  according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed to the  ages. Amen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_6" data-id="RM9_6">And it is not possible that the word of God hath failed; for  not all who [are] of Israel are these Israel;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_7" data-id="RM9_7">nor because they are seed of Abraham [are] all children, but  -- `in Isaac shall a seed be called to thee;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_8" data-id="RM9_8">that is, the children of the flesh -- these [are] not  children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned  for seed;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_9" data-id="RM9_9">for the word of promise [is] this; `According to this time I  will come, and there shall be to Sarah a son.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_10" data-id="RM9_10">And not only [so], but also Rebecca, having conceived by  one -- Isaac our father --</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_11" data-id="RM9_11">(for they being not yet born, neither having done anything  good or evil, that the purpose of God, according to choice,  might remain; not of works, but of Him who is calling,) it was  said to her --</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_12" data-id="RM9_12">`The greater shall serve the less;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_13" data-id="RM9_13">according as it hath been written, `Jacob I did love, and  Esau I did hate.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_14" data-id="RM9_14">What, then, shall we say? unrighteousness [is] with God?  let it not be!</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_15" data-id="RM9_15">for to Moses He saith, `I will do kindness to whom I do  kindness, and I will have compassion on whom I have  compassion;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_16" data-id="RM9_16">so, then -- not of him who is willing, nor of him who is  running, but of God who is doing kindness:</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_17" data-id="RM9_17">for the Writing saith to Pharaoh -- `For this very thing I  did raise thee up, that I might shew in thee My power, and  that My name might be declared in all the land;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_18" data-id="RM9_18">so, then, to whom He willeth, He doth kindness, and to whom  He willeth, He doth harden.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_19" data-id="RM9_19">Thou wilt say, then, to me, `Why yet doth He find fault?  for His counsel who hath resisted?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_20" data-id="RM9_20">nay, but, O man, who art thou that art answering again to  God? shall the thing formed say to Him who did form [it], Why  me didst thou make thus?</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_21" data-id="RM9_21">hath not the potter authority over the clay, out of the  same lump to make the one vessel to honour, and the one to  dishonour?</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_22" data-id="RM9_22">And if God, willing to shew the wrath and to make known His  power, did endure, in much long suffering, vessels of wrath  fitted for destruction,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_23" data-id="RM9_23">and that He might make known the riches of His glory on  vessels of kindness, that He before prepared for glory, whom  also He did call -- us --</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_24" data-id="RM9_24">not only out of Jews, but also out of nations,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_25" data-id="RM9_25">as also in Hosea He saith, `I will call what [is] not My  people -- My people; and her not beloved -- Beloved,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_26" data-id="RM9_26">and it shall be -- in the place where it was said to them,  Ye [are] not My people; there they shall be called sons of the  living God.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_27" data-id="RM9_27">And Isaiah doth cry concerning Israel, `If the number of  the sons of Israel may be as the sand of the sea, the remnant  shall be saved;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_28" data-id="RM9_28">for a matter He is finishing, and is cutting short in  righteousness, because a matter cut short will the Lord do  upon the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_29" data-id="RM9_29">and according as Isaiah saith before, `Except the Lord of  Sabaoth did leave to us a seed, as Sodom we had become, and as  Gomorrah we had been made like.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_30" data-id="RM9_30">What, then, shall we say? that nations who are not pursuing  righteousness did attain to righteousness, and righteousness  that [is] of faith,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_31" data-id="RM9_31">and Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, at a law of  righteousness did not arrive;</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_32" data-id="RM9_32">wherefore? because -- not by faith, but as by works of law;  for they did stumble at the stone of stumbling,</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_33" data-id="RM9_33">according as it hath been written, `Lo, I place in Sion a  stone of stumbling and a rock of offence; and every one who is  believing thereon shall not be ashamed.'</span>
