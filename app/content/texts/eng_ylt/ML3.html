<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_2" data-id="ML3_2">And who is bearing the day of his coming? And who is  standing in his appearing? For he [is] as fire of a refiner,  And as soap of a fuller.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_3" data-id="ML3_3">And he hath sat, a refiner and purifier of silver, And he  hath purified the sons of Levi, And hath refined them as gold  and as silver, And they have been to Jehovah bringing nigh a  present in righteousness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_4" data-id="ML3_4">And sweet to Jehovah hath been the present of Judah and  Jerusalem, As in days of old, and as in former years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_5" data-id="ML3_5">And I have drawn near to you for judgment, And I have been a  witness, Making haste against sorcerers, And against  adulterers, And against swearers to a falsehood, And against  oppressors of the hire of an hireling, Of a widow, and of a  fatherless one, And those turning aside a sojourner, And who  fear Me not, said Jehovah of Hosts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_6" data-id="ML3_6">For I [am] Jehovah, I have not changed, And ye, the sons of  Jacob, Ye have not been consumed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_7" data-id="ML3_7">Even from the days of your fathers Ye have turned aside from  My statutes, And ye have not taken heed. Turn back unto Me, and  I turn back to you, Said Jehovah of Hosts. And ye have said,  `In what do we turn back?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_8" data-id="ML3_8">Doth man deceive God? but ye are deceiving Me, And ye have  said: `In what have we deceived Thee?' The tithe and the  heave-offering!</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_9" data-id="ML3_9">With a curse ye are cursed! And Me ye are deceiving -- this  nation -- all of it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_10" data-id="ML3_10">Bring in all the tithe unto the treasure-house, And there  is food in My house; When ye have tried Me, now, with this,  Said Jehovah of Hosts, Do not I open to you the windows of  heaven? Yea, I have emptied on you a blessing till there is no  space.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_11" data-id="ML3_11">And I have pushed for you against the consumer, And He doth  not destroy to you the fruit of the ground, Nor miscarry to you  doth the vine in the field, Said Jehovah of Hosts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_12" data-id="ML3_12">And declared you happy have all the nations, For ye are a  delightful land, said Jehovah of Hosts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_13" data-id="ML3_13">Hard against Me have been your words, Said Jehovah, and ye  have said: `What have we spoken against Thee?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_14" data-id="ML3_14">Ye have said, `A vain thing to serve God! And what gain  when we kept His charge? And when we have gone in black,  Because of Jehovah of Hosts?</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_15" data-id="ML3_15">And now, we are declaring the proud happy, Yea, built up  have been those doing wickedness, Yea they have tempted God,  and escape.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_16" data-id="ML3_16">Then have those fearing Jehovah spoken one to another, And  Jehovah doth attend and hear, And written is a book of memorial  before Him Of those fearing Jehovah, And of those esteeming  His name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_17" data-id="ML3_17">And they have been to Me, said Jehovah of Hosts, In the day  that I am appointing -- a peculiar treasure, And I have had  pity on them, As one hath pity on his son who is serving him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML3_18" data-id="ML3_18">And ye have turned back and considered, Between the  righteous and the wicked, Between the servant of God and him  who is not His servant.</span>
