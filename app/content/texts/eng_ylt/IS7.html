<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS7_2" data-id="IS7_2">And it is declared to the house of David, saying, `Aram hath  been led towards Ephraim,' And his heart and the heart of his  people is moved, like the moving of trees of a forest by the  presence of wind.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS7_3" data-id="IS7_3">And Jehovah saith unto Isaiah, `Go forth, I pray thee, to  meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-Jashub thy son, unto the end of the  conduit of the upper pool, unto the highway of the fuller's  field,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS7_4" data-id="IS7_4">and thou hast said unto him: `Take heed, and be quiet, fear  not, And let not thy heart be timid, Because of these two tails  of smoking brands, For the fierceness of the anger of Rezin and  Aram, And the son of Remaliah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS7_5" data-id="IS7_5">Because that Aram counselled against thee evil, Ephraim and  the son of Remaliah, saying:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS7_6" data-id="IS7_6">We go up into Judah, and we vex it, And we rend it unto  ourselves, And we cause a king to reign in its midst -- The son  of Tabeal.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS7_7" data-id="IS7_7">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: It doth not stand, nor shall it  be!</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS7_8" data-id="IS7_8">For the head of Aram [is] Damascus, And the head of Damascus  [is] Rezin, And within sixty and five years Is Ephraim broken  from [being] a people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS7_9" data-id="IS7_9">And the head of Ephraim [is] Samaria, And the head of  Samaria [is] the son of Remaliah. If ye do not give credence,  Surely ye are not stedfast.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS7_10" data-id="IS7_10">And Jehovah addeth to speak unto Ahaz, saying:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS7_11" data-id="IS7_11">`Ask for thee a sign from Jehovah thy God, Make deep the  request, or make [it] high upwards.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS7_12" data-id="IS7_12">And Ahaz saith, `I do not ask nor try Jehovah.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS7_13" data-id="IS7_13">And he saith, `Hear, I pray you, O house of David, Is it a  little thing for you to weary men, That ye weary also my God?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS7_14" data-id="IS7_14">Therefore the Lord Himself giveth to you a sign, Lo, the  Virgin is conceiving, And is bringing forth a son, And hath  called his name Immanuel,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS7_15" data-id="IS7_15">Butter and honey he doth eat, When he knoweth to refuse  evil, and to fix on good.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS7_16" data-id="IS7_16">For before the youth doth know To refuse evil, and to fix  on good, Forsaken is the land thou art vexed with, because of  her two kings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS7_17" data-id="IS7_17">Jehovah bringeth on thee, and on thy people, And on the  house of thy father, Days that have not come, Even from the day  of the turning aside of Ephraim from Judah, By the king of  Asshur.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS7_18" data-id="IS7_18">And it hath come to pass, in that day, Jehovah doth hiss  for a fly that [is] in the extremity of the brooks of Egypt,  And for a bee that [is] in the land of Asshur.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS7_19" data-id="IS7_19">And they have come, and rested all of them in the desolate  valleys, And in holes of the rocks, and on all the thorns, And  on all the commendable things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS7_20" data-id="IS7_20">In that day doth the Lord shave, By a razor that is hired  beyond the river, By the king of Asshur, The head, and the hair  of the feet, Yea, also the beard it consumeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS7_21" data-id="IS7_21">And it hath come to pass, in that day, A man keepeth alive  a heifer of the herd, And two of the flock,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS7_22" data-id="IS7_22">And it hath come to pass, From the abundance of the  yielding of milk he eateth butter, For butter and honey doth  every one eat Who is left in the heart of the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS7_23" data-id="IS7_23">And it hath come to pass, in that day, Every place where  there are a thousand vines, At a thousand silverlings, Is for  briers and for thorns.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS7_24" data-id="IS7_24">With arrows and with bow he cometh thither, Because all the  land is brier and thorn.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS7_25" data-id="IS7_25">And all the hills that with a mattock are kept in order,  Thither cometh not the fear of brier and thorn, And it hath  been for the sending forth of ox, And for the treading of  sheep!'</span>
