<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_2" data-id="JB32_2">and burn doth the anger of Elihu son of Barachel the  Buzite, of the family of Ram; against Job hath his anger  burned, because of his justifying himself more than God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_3" data-id="JB32_3">and against his three friends hath his anger burned,  because that they have not found an answer, and condemn Job.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_4" data-id="JB32_4">And Elihu hath waited earnestly beside Job with words, for  they are older than he in days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_5" data-id="JB32_5">And Elihu seeth that there is no answer in the mouth of the  three men, and his anger burneth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_6" data-id="JB32_6">And Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite answereth and saith:  -- Young I [am] in days, and ye [are] age Therefore I have  feared, And am afraid of shewing you my opinion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_7" data-id="JB32_7">I said: Days do speak, And multitude of years teach wisdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_8" data-id="JB32_8">Surely a spirit is in man, And the breath of the Mighty One  Doth cause them to understand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_9" data-id="JB32_9">The multitude are not wise, Nor do the aged understand  judgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_10" data-id="JB32_10">Therefore I have said: Hearken to me, I do shew my opinion  -- even I.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_11" data-id="JB32_11">Lo, I have waited for your words, I give ear unto your  reasons, Till ye search out sayings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_12" data-id="JB32_12">And unto you I attend, And lo, there is no reasoner for  Job, [Or] answerer of his sayings among you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_13" data-id="JB32_13">Lest ye say, We have found wisdom, God doth thrust him  away, not man.</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_17" data-id="JB32_17">I answer, even I -- my share, I shew my opinion -- even I.</span>

<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_19" data-id="JB32_19">Lo, my breast [is] as wine not opened, Like new bottles it  is broken up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_20" data-id="JB32_20">I speak, and there is refreshment to me, I open my lips  and answer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_21" data-id="JB32_21">Let me not, I pray you, accept the face of any, Nor unto  man give flattering titles,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB32_22" data-id="JB32_22">For I have not known to give flattering titles, In a  little doth my Maker take me away.</span>
