<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_2" data-id="ZC9_2">And also Hamath doth border thereon, Tyre and Zidon, for --  very wise!</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_3" data-id="ZC9_3">And Tyre doth build a bulwark to herself, And doth heap  silver as dust, And gold as mire of out-places.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_4" data-id="ZC9_4">Lo, the Lord doth dispossess her, And He hath smitten in the  sea her force, And she with fire is consumed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_5" data-id="ZC9_5">See doth Ashkelon and fear, Also Gaza, and she is  exceedingly pained, Also Ekron -- for her expectation dried up,  And perished hath a king from Gaza, And Ashkelon doth not  remain,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_6" data-id="ZC9_6">And dwelt hath a foreigner in Ashdod, And I have cut off the  excellency of the Philistines.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_7" data-id="ZC9_7">And turned aside his blood from his mouth, His abominations  from between his teeth, And he hath remained, even he, to our  God, And he hath been as a leader in Judah, And Ekron as a  Jebusite.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_8" data-id="ZC9_8">And I have pitched for My house a camp, Because of the  passer through, and of the returner, And pass not through  against them again doth an exactor, For, now, I have seen with  My eyes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_9" data-id="ZC9_9">Rejoice exceedingly, O daughter of Zion, Shout, O daughter  of Jerusalem, Lo, thy King doth come to thee, Righteous -- and  saved is He, Afflicted -- and riding on an ass, And on a colt  -- a son of she-asses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_10" data-id="ZC9_10">And I have cut off the chariot from Ephraim, And the horse  from Jerusalem, Yea, cut off hath been the bow of battle, And  he hath spoken peace to nations, And his rule [is] from sea  unto sea, And from the river unto the ends of earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_11" data-id="ZC9_11">Also thou -- by the blood of thy covenant, I have sent thy  prisoners out of the pit, There is no water in it.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_14" data-id="ZC9_14">And Jehovah doth appear for them, And gone forth as  lightning hath His arrow, And the Lord Jehovah with a trumpet  bloweth, And He hath gone with whirlwinds of the south.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_15" data-id="ZC9_15">Jehovah of Hosts doth cover them over, And they consumed,  and subdued sling-stones, Yea, they have drunk, They have made  a noise as wine, And they have been full as a bowl, As corners  of an altar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_16" data-id="ZC9_16">And saved them hath Jehovah their God In that day, as a  flock of His people, For stones of a crown are displaying  themselves over His ground.</span>
