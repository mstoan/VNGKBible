<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT15_3" data-id="DT15_3">of the stranger thou mayest exact, and that which is thine  with thy brother doth thy hand release;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT15_4" data-id="DT15_4">only when there is no needy one with thee, for Jehovah doth  greatly bless thee in the land which Jehovah thy God is giving  to thee -- an inheritance to possess it.</span>
