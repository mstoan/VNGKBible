<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB1_2" data-id="HB1_2">in these last days did speak to us in a Son, whom He  appointed heir of all things, through whom also He did make the  ages;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB1_3" data-id="HB1_3">who being the brightness of the glory, and the impress of  His subsistence, bearing up also the all things by the saying  of his might -- through himself having made a cleansing of our  sins, sat down at the right hand of the greatness in the  highest,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB1_4" data-id="HB1_4">having become so much better than the messengers, as he did  inherit a more excellent name than they.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB1_5" data-id="HB1_5">For to which of the messengers said He ever, `My Son thou  art -- I to-day have begotten thee?' and again, `I will be to  him for a father, and he shall be to Me for a son?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB1_6" data-id="HB1_6">and when again He may bring in the first-born to the world,  He saith, `And let them bow before him -- all messengers of  God;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB1_7" data-id="HB1_7">and unto the messengers, indeed, He saith, `Who is making  His messengers spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB1_8" data-id="HB1_8">and unto the Son: `Thy throne, O God, [is] to the age of the  age; a scepter of righteousness [is] the scepter of thy reign;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB1_9" data-id="HB1_9">thou didst love righteousness, and didst hate lawlessness;  because of this did He anoint thee -- God, thy God -- with oil  of gladness above thy partners;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB1_10" data-id="HB1_10">and, `Thou, at the beginning, Lord, the earth didst found,  and a work of thy hands are the heavens;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB1_11" data-id="HB1_11">these shall perish, and Thou dost remain, and all, as a  garment, shall become old,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB1_12" data-id="HB1_12">and as a mantle Thou shall roll them together, and they  shall be changed, and Thou art the same, and Thy years shall  not fail.'</span>
