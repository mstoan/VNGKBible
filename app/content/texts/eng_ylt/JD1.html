<div class="mt">Jude</div><div class="c">1</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JD1_1" data-id="JD1_1">Judas, of Jesus Christ a servant, and brother of James, to  those sanctified in God the Father, and in Jesus Christ kept --  called,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JD1_2" data-id="JD1_2">kindness to you, and peace, and love, be multiplied!</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JD1_3" data-id="JD1_3">Beloved, all diligence using to write to you concerning the  common salvation, I had necessity to write to you, exhorting to  agonize for the faith once delivered to the saints,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JD1_4" data-id="JD1_4">for there did come in unobserved certain men, long ago  having been written beforehand to this judgment, impious, the  grace of our God perverting to lasciviousness, and our only  Master, God, and Lord -- Jesus Christ -- denying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JD1_5" data-id="JD1_5">and to remind you I intend, you knowing once this, that the  Lord, a people out of the land of Egypt having saved, again  those who did not believe did destroy;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JD1_6" data-id="JD1_6">messengers also, those who did not keep their own  principality, but did leave their proper dwelling, to a  judgment of a great day, in bonds everlasting, under darkness  He hath kept,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JD1_7" data-id="JD1_7">as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them, in like  manner to these, having given themselves to whoredom, and gone  after other flesh, have been set before -- an example, of fire  age-during, justice suffering.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JD1_8" data-id="JD1_8">In like manner, nevertheless, those dreaming also the flesh  indeed do defile, and lordship they put away, and dignities  they speak evil of,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JD1_9" data-id="JD1_9">yet Michael, the chief messenger, when, with the devil  contending, he was disputing about the body of Moses, did not  dare to bring up an evil-speaking judgment, but said, `The  Lord rebuke thee!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JD1_10" data-id="JD1_10">and these, as many things indeed as they have not known,  they speak evil of; and as many things as naturally (as the  irrational beasts) they understand, in these they are  corrupted;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JD1_11" data-id="JD1_11">wo to them! because in the way of Cain they did go on, and  to the deceit of Balaam for reward they did rush, and in the  gainsaying of Korah they did perish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JD1_12" data-id="JD1_12">These are in your love-feasts craggy rocks; feasting  together with you, without fear shepherding themselves; clouds  without water, by winds carried about; trees autumnal, without  fruit, twice dead, rooted up;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JD1_13" data-id="JD1_13">wild waves of a sea, foaming out their own shames; stars  going astray, to whom the gloom of the darkness to the age hath  been kept.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JD1_14" data-id="JD1_14">And prophesy also to these did the seventh from Adam --  Enoch -- saying, `Lo, the Lord did come in His saintly myriads,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JD1_15" data-id="JD1_15">to do judgment against all, and to convict all their  impious ones, concerning all their works of impiety that they  did impiously, and concerning all the stiff things that speak  against Him did impious sinners.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JD1_16" data-id="JD1_16">These are murmurers, repiners; according to their desires  walking, and their mouth doth speak great swellings, giving  admiration to persons for the sake of profit;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JD1_17" data-id="JD1_17">and ye, beloved, remember ye the sayings spoken before by  the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ:</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JD1_18" data-id="JD1_18">that they said to you, that in the last time there shall be  scoffers, after their own desires of impieties going on,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JD1_19" data-id="JD1_19">these are those setting themselves apart, natural men, the  Spirit not having.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JD1_20" data-id="JD1_20">And ye, beloved, on your most holy faith building  yourselves up, in the Holy Spirit praying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JD1_21" data-id="JD1_21">yourselves in the love of God keep ye, waiting for the  kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ -- to life age-during;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JD1_22" data-id="JD1_22">and to some be kind, judging thoroughly,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JD1_23" data-id="JD1_23">and some in fear save ye, out of the fire snatching, hating  even the coat from the flesh spotted.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JD1_24" data-id="JD1_24">And to Him who is able to guard you not stumbling, and to  set [you] in the presence of His glory unblemished, in  gladness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JD1_25" data-id="JD1_25">to the only wise God our Saviour, [is] glory and greatness,  power and authority, both now and to all the ages! Amen.</span>
