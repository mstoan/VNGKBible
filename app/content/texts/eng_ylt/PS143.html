<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS143_2" data-id="PS143_2">And enter not into judgment with Thy servant, For no one  living is justified before Thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS143_3" data-id="PS143_3">For an enemy hath pursued my soul, He hath bruised to the  earth my life, He hath caused me to dwell in dark places, As  the dead of old.</span>
