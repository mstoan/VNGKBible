<div class="c">3</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_1" data-id="C13_1">And I, brethren, was not able to speak to you as to  spiritual, but as to fleshly -- as to babes in Christ;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_2" data-id="C13_2">with milk I fed you, and not with meat, for ye were not yet  able, but not even yet are ye now able,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_3" data-id="C13_3">for yet ye are fleshly, for where [there is] among you  envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not fleshly, and in  the manner of men do walk?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_4" data-id="C13_4">for when one may say, `I, indeed, am of Paul;' and another,  `I -- of Apollos;' are ye not fleshly?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_5" data-id="C13_5">Who, then, is Paul, and who Apollos, but ministrants through  whom ye did believe, and to each as the Lord gave?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_6" data-id="C13_6">I planted, Apollos watered, but God was giving growth;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_7" data-id="C13_7">so that neither is he who is planting anything, nor he who  is watering, but He who is giving growth -- God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_8" data-id="C13_8">and he who is planting and he who is watering are one, and  each his own reward shall receive, according to his own labour,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_9" data-id="C13_9">for of God we are fellow-workmen; God's tillage, God's  building ye are.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_10" data-id="C13_10">According to the grace of God that was given to me, as a  wise master-builder, a foundation I have laid, and another doth  build on [it],</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_11" data-id="C13_11">for other foundation no one is able to lay except that  which is laid, which is Jesus the Christ;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_12" data-id="C13_12">and if any one doth build upon this foundation gold,  silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw --</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_13" data-id="C13_13">of each the work shall become manifest, for the day shall  declare [it], because in fire it is revealed, and the work of  each, what kind it is, the fire shall prove;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_14" data-id="C13_14">if of any one the work doth remain that he built on [it], a  wage he shall receive;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_15" data-id="C13_15">if of any the work is burned up, he shall suffer loss; and  himself shall be saved, but so as through fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_16" data-id="C13_16">have ye not known that ye are a sanctuary of God, and the  Spirit of God doth dwell in you?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_17" data-id="C13_17">if any one the sanctuary of God doth waste, him shall God  waste; for the sanctuary of God is holy, the which ye are.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_18" data-id="C13_18">Let no one deceive himself; if any one doth seem to be wise  among you in this age -- let him become a fool, that he may  become wise,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_19" data-id="C13_19">for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, for  it hath been written, `Who is taking the wise in their  craftiness;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_20" data-id="C13_20">and again, `The Lord doth know the reasonings of the wise,  that they are vain.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_21" data-id="C13_21">So then, let no one glory in men, for all things are yours,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_22" data-id="C13_22">whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life,  or death, or things present, or things about to be -- all are  yours,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_23" data-id="C13_23">and ye [are] Christ's, and Christ [is] God's.</span>
