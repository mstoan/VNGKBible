<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS1_2" data-id="HS1_2">The commencement of Jehovah's speaking by Hosea. And Jehovah  saith unto Hosea, `Go, take to thee a woman of whoredoms, and  children of whoredoms, for utterly go a-whoring doth the land  from after Jehovah.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS1_3" data-id="HS1_3">And he goeth and taketh Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she  conceiveth and beareth to him a son;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS1_4" data-id="HS1_4">and Jehovah saith unto him, `Call his name Jezreel, for yet  a little, and I have charged the blood of Jezreel on the house  of Jehu, and have caused to cease the kingdom of the house of  Israel;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS1_5" data-id="HS1_5">and it hath come to pass in that day that I have broken the  bow of Israel, in the valley of Jezreel.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS1_6" data-id="HS1_6">And she conceiveth again, and beareth a daughter, and He  saith to him, `Call her name Lo-Ruhamah, for I add no more to  pity the house of Israel, for I do utterly take them away;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS1_7" data-id="HS1_7">and the house of Judah I pity, and have saved them by  Jehovah their God, and do not save them by bow, and by sword,  and by battle, by horses, and by horsemen.'</span>
