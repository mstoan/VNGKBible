<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS46_2" data-id="IS46_2">They have stooped, they have bowed together, They have not  been able to deliver the burden, And themselves into captivity  have gone.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS46_3" data-id="IS46_3">Hearken unto Me, O house of Jacob, And all the remnant of  Israel, Who are borne from the belly, Who are carried from the  womb,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS46_4" data-id="IS46_4">Even to old age I [am] He, and to grey hairs I carry, I  made, and I bear, yea, I carry and deliver.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS46_5" data-id="IS46_5">To whom do ye liken Me, and make equal? And compare Me,  that we may be like?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS46_6" data-id="IS46_6">-- They are pouring out gold from a bag, And silver on the  beam they weigh, They hire a refiner, and he maketh it a god,  They fall down, yea, they bow themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS46_7" data-id="IS46_7">They lift him up on the shoulder, They carry him, and cause  him to rest in his place, And he standeth, from his place he  moveth not, Yea, one crieth unto him, and he answereth not,  From his adversity he saveth him not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS46_8" data-id="IS46_8">Remember this, and shew yourselves men, Turn [it] back, O  transgressors, to the heart.</span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS46_10" data-id="IS46_10">Declaring from the beginning the latter end, And from of  old that which hath not been done, Saying, `My counsel doth  stand, And all My delight I do.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS46_11" data-id="IS46_11">Calling from the east a ravenous bird, From a far land the  man of My counsel, Yea, I have spoken, yea, I bring it in, I  have formed [it], yea, I do it.</span>
