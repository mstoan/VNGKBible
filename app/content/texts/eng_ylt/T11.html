<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_2" data-id="T11_2">to Timotheus -- genuine child in faith: Grace, kindness,  peace, from God our Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_3" data-id="T11_3">according as I did exhort thee to remain in Ephesus -- I  going on to Macedonia -- that thou mightest charge certain not  to teach any other thing,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_4" data-id="T11_4">nor to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, that  cause questions rather than the building up of God that is in  faith: --</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_5" data-id="T11_5">And the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart, and  of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_6" data-id="T11_6">from which certain, having swerved, did turn aside to vain  discourse,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_7" data-id="T11_7">willing to be teachers of law, not understanding either the  things they say, nor concerning what they asseverate,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_8" data-id="T11_8">and we have known that the law [is] good, if any one may use  it lawfully;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_9" data-id="T11_9">having known this, that for a righteous man law is not set,  but for lawless and insubordinate persons, ungodly and  sinners, impious and profane, parricides and matricides,  men-slayers,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_10" data-id="T11_10">whoremongers, sodomites, men-stealers, liars, perjured  persons, and if there be any other thing that to sound  doctrine is adverse,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_11" data-id="T11_11">according to the good news of the glory of the blessed God,  with which I was entrusted.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_12" data-id="T11_12">And I give thanks to him who enabled me -- Christ Jesus our  Lord -- that he did reckon me stedfast, having put [me] to the  ministration,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_13" data-id="T11_13">who before was speaking evil, and persecuting, and  insulting, but I found kindness, because, being ignorant, I did  [it] in unbelief,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_14" data-id="T11_14">and exceedingly abound did the grace of our Lord, with  faith and love that [is] in Christ Jesus:</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_15" data-id="T11_15">stedfast [is] the word, and of all acceptation worthy, that  Christ Jesus came to the world to save sinners -- first of whom  I am;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_16" data-id="T11_16">but because of this I found kindness, that in me first  Jesus Christ might shew forth all long-suffering, for a pattern  of those about to believe on him to life age-during:</span>

<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_19" data-id="T11_19">having faith and a good conscience, which certain having  thrust away, concerning the faith did make shipwreck,</span>
