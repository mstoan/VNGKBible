<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_2" data-id="K217_2">and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, only,  not as the kings of Israel who were before him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_3" data-id="K217_3">against him came up Shalmaneser king of Asshur, and Hoshea  is to him a servant, and doth render to him a present.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_4" data-id="K217_4">And the king of Asshur findeth in Hoshea a conspiracy, in  that he hath sent messengers unto So king of Egypt, and hath  not caused a present to go up to the king of Asshur, as year by  year, and the king of Asshur restraineth him, and bindeth him  in a house of restraint.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_5" data-id="K217_5">And the king of Asshur goeth up into all the land, and he  goeth up to Samaria, and layeth siege against it three years;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_6" data-id="K217_6">in the ninth year of Hoshea hath the king of Asshur  captured Samaria, and removeth Israel to Asshur, and causeth  them to dwell in Halah, and in Habor, [by] the river Gozan, and  [in] the cities of the Medes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_7" data-id="K217_7">And it cometh to pass, because the sons of Israel have  sinned against Jehovah their God -- who bringeth them up out of  the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt  -- and fear other gods,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_8" data-id="K217_8">and walk in the statutes of the nations that Jehovah  dispossessed from the presence of the sons of Israel, and of  the kings of Israel that they made;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_9" data-id="K217_9">and the sons of Israel do covertly things that [are] not  right against Jehovah their God, and build for them high places  in all their cities, from a tower of the watchers unto the  fenced city,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_10" data-id="K217_10">and set up for them standing-pillars and shrines on every  high height, and under every green tree,</span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_18" data-id="K217_18">That Jehovah sheweth himself very angry against Israel,  and turneth them aside from His presence; none hath been left,  only the tribe of Judah by itself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_19" data-id="K217_19">Also Judah hath not kept the commands of Jehovah their  God, and they walk in the statutes of Israel that they had  made.</span>

<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_21" data-id="K217_21">for He hath rent Israel from the house of David, and they  make Jeroboam son of Nebat king, and Jeroboam driveth Israel  from after Jehovah, and hath caused them to sin a great sin,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_22" data-id="K217_22">and the sons of Israel walk in all the sins of Jeroboam  that he did, they have not turned aside therefrom,</span>

<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_24" data-id="K217_24">And the king of Asshur bringeth in from Babylon and from  Cutha, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and  causeth [them] to dwell in the cities of Samaria instead of the  sons of Israel, and they possess Samaria, and dwell in its  cities;</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_25" data-id="K217_25">and it cometh to pass, at the commencement of their  dwelling there, they have not feared Jehovah, and Jehovah doth  send among them the lions, and they are destroying among them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_26" data-id="K217_26">And they speak to the king of Asshur, saying, `The nations  that thou hast removed, and dost place in the cities of Samaria,  have not known the custom of the God of the land, and He  sendeth among them the lions, and lo, they are destroying them,  as they do not know the custom of the God of the land.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_27" data-id="K217_27">And the king of Asshur commandeth, saying, `Cause to go  thither one of the priests whom ye removed thence, and they go  and dwell there, and he doth teach them the custom of the God  of the land.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_28" data-id="K217_28">And one of the priests whom they removed from Samaria  cometh in, and dwelleth in Beth-El, and he is teaching them how  they do fear Jehovah,</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_29" data-id="K217_29">and they are making each nation its gods, and place [them]  in the houses of the high places that the Samaritans have made,  each nation in their cities where they are dwelling.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_30" data-id="K217_30">And the men of Babylon have made Succoth-Benoth, and the  men of Cuth have made Nergal, and the men of Hamath have made  Ashima,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_31" data-id="K217_31">and the Avites have made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the  Sepharvites are burning their sons with fire to Adrammelech and  Anammelech, gods of Sepharvim.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_32" data-id="K217_32">And they are fearing Jehovah, and make to themselves from  their extremities priests of high places, and they are acting  for them in the house of the high places.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_33" data-id="K217_33">Jehovah they are fearing, and their gods they are serving,  according to the custom of the nations whence they removed  them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_34" data-id="K217_34">Unto this day they are doing according to the former  customs -- they are not fearing Jehovah, and are not doing  according to their statutes, and according to their ordinances,  and according to the law, and according to the command, that  Jehovah commanded the sons of Jacob whose name He made Israel,</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_35" data-id="K217_35">and Jehovah maketh with them a covenant, and chargeth  them, saying, `Ye do not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to  them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_36" data-id="K217_36">but Jehovah who brought you up out of the land of Egypt  with great power, and with a stretched-out arm, Him ye do fear,  and to Him ye bow yourselves, and to Him ye do sacrifice;</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_37" data-id="K217_37">and the statutes, and the judgments, and the law, and the  command, that He wrote for you, ye observe to do all the days,  and ye do not fear other gods;</span>
