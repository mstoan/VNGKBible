Into a land of  adversity and distress, Of young lion and of old lion, Whence  [are] viper and flying saraph, They carry on the shoulder of  asses their wealth, And on the hump of camels their treasures,  Unto a people not profitable.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS30_7" data-id="IS30_7">Yea, Egyptians [are] vanity, and in vain do help, Therefore  I have cried concerning this: `Their strength [is] to sit  still.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS30_17" data-id="IS30_17">One thousand because of the rebuke of one, Because of the  rebuke of five ye flee, Till ye have been surely left as a pole  On the top of the mountain, And as an ensign on the height.</span>

<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS30_27" data-id="IS30_27">Lo, the name of Jehovah is coming from far, Burning is His  anger, and great the flame, His lips have been full of  indignation, And His tongue [is] as a devouring fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS30_28" data-id="IS30_28">And His breath [is] as an overflowing stream, Unto the  neck it divideth, To sift nations with a sieve of vanity, And a  bridle causing to err, [Is] on the jaws of the peoples.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS30_29" data-id="IS30_29">Singing is to you as in a night sanctified for a festival,  And joy of heart as he who is going with a pipe, To go in to  the mountain of Jehovah, Unto the rock of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS30_30" data-id="IS30_30">And caused to be heard hath Jehovah The honour of His  voice, And the coming down of His arm He doth shew with the  raging of anger, And the flame of a consuming fire, Scattering,  and inundation, and hailstone.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS30_31" data-id="IS30_31">For from the voice of Jehovah broken down [is] Asshur,  With a rod He smiteth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS30_32" data-id="IS30_32">And every passage of the settled staff, That Jehovah  causeth to rest on him, Hath been with tabrets, and with harps,  And in battles of shaking he hath fought with it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS30_33" data-id="IS30_33">For, arranged from former time is Tophet, Even it for the  king is prepared, He hath made deep, He hath made large, Its  pile [is] fire and much wood, The breath of Jehovah, As a  stream of brim stone, is burning in it!</span>
