<div class="c">4</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_1" data-id="HB4_1">We may fear, then, lest a promise being left of entering  into His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_2" data-id="HB4_2">for we also are having good news proclaimed, even as they,  but the word heard did not profit them, not being mixed with  faith in those who heard,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_3" data-id="HB4_3">for we do enter into the rest -- we who did believe, as He  said, `So I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest  -- ;' and yet the works were done from the foundation of the  world,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_4" data-id="HB4_4">for He spake in a certain place concerning the seventh [day]  thus: `And God did rest in the seventh day from all His works;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_5" data-id="HB4_5">and in this [place] again, `If they shall enter into My rest  -- ;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_6" data-id="HB4_6">since then, it remaineth for certain to enter into it, and  those who did first hear good news entered not in because of  unbelief --</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_7" data-id="HB4_7">again He doth limit a certain day, `To-day,' (in David  saying, after so long a time,) as it hath been said, `To-day,  if His voice ye may hear, ye may not harden your hearts,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_8" data-id="HB4_8">for if Joshua had given them rest, He would not concerning  another day have spoken after these things;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_9" data-id="HB4_9">there doth remain, then, a sabbatic rest to the people of  God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_10" data-id="HB4_10">for he who did enter into his rest, he also rested from his  works, as God from His own.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_11" data-id="HB4_11">May we be diligent, then, to enter into that rest, that no  one in the same example of the unbelief may fall,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_12" data-id="HB4_12">for the reckoning of God is living, and working, and sharp  above every two-edged sword, and piercing unto the dividing  asunder both of soul and spirit, of joints also and marrow,  and a discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_13" data-id="HB4_13">and there is not a created thing not manifest before Him,  but all things [are] naked and open to His eyes -- with whom  is our reckoning.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_14" data-id="HB4_14">Having, then, a great chief priest passed through the  heavens -- Jesus the Son of God -- may we hold fast the  profession,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_15" data-id="HB4_15">for we have not a chief priest unable to sympathise with  our infirmities, but [one] tempted in all things in like  manner -- apart from sin;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_16" data-id="HB4_16">we may come near, then, with freedom, to the throne of the  grace, that we may receive kindness, and find grace -- for  seasonable help.</span>
