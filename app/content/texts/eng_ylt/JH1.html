<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH1_6" data-id="JH1_6">And the chief of the company draweth near to him, and saith  to him, `What -- to thee, O sleeper? rise, call unto thy God,  it may be God doth bethink himself of us, and we do not  perish.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH1_7" data-id="JH1_7">And they say each unto his neighbour, `Come, and we cast  lots, and we know on whose account this evil [is] on us.' And  they cast lots, and the lot falleth on Jonah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH1_8" data-id="JH1_8">And they say unto him, `Declare to us, we pray thee, on what  account this evil [is] on us? what [is] thine occupation, and  whence comest thou? what [is] thy country, seeing thou art not  of this people?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH1_9" data-id="JH1_9">And he saith unto them, `A Hebrew I [am], and Jehovah, God  of the heavens, I am reverencing, who made the sea and the dry  land.'</span>
