<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_2" data-id="ER4_2">and they draw nigh unto Zerubbabel, and unto heads of the  fathers, and say to them, `Let us build with you; for, like  you, we seek to your God, and we are not sacrificing since the  days of Esar-Haddon king of Asshur, who brought us up hither.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_3" data-id="ER4_3">And Zerubbabel saith to them, also Jeshua, and the rest of  the heads of the fathers of Israel, `Not for you, and for us,  to build a house to our God; but we ourselves together do build  to Jehovah God of Israel, as the king Cyrus, king of Persia,  commanded us.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_4" data-id="ER4_4">And it cometh to pass, the people of the land are making the  hands of the people of Judah feeble, and troubling them in  building,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_5" data-id="ER4_5">and are hiring against them counsellors to make void their  counsel all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even till the  reign of Darius king of Persia.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_6" data-id="ER4_6">And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the commencement of his  reign, they have written an accusation against the inhabitants  of Judah and Jerusalem;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_7" data-id="ER4_7">and in the days of Artaxerxes have Bishlam, Mithredath,  Tabeel, and the rest of his companions written unto Artaxerxes  king of Persia, and the writing of the letter is written in  Aramaean, and interpreted in Aramaean.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_8" data-id="ER4_8">Rehum counsellor, and Shimshai scribe have written a letter  concerning Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king, thus:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_9" data-id="ER4_9">Then Rehum counsellor, and Shimshai scribe, and the rest of  their companions, Dinaites, and Apharsathchites, Tarpelites,  Apharsites, Archevites, Babylonians, Susanchites, (who are  Elamites),</span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_13" data-id="ER4_13">`Now, be it known to the king, that if this city be builded,  and the walls finished, toll, tribute, and custom they do not  give; and at length [to] the kings it doth cause loss.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_14" data-id="ER4_14">Now, because that the salt of the palace [is] our salt, and  the nakedness of the king we have no patience to see, therefore  we have sent and made known to the king;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_15" data-id="ER4_15">so that he doth seek in the book of the records of thy  fathers, and thou dost find in the book of the records, and  dost know, that this city [is] a rebellious city, and causing  loss [to] kings and provinces, and makers of sedition [are] in  its midst from the days of old, therefore hath this city been  wasted.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_16" data-id="ER4_16">We are making known to the king that, if this city be  builded and the walls finished, by this means a portion beyond  the river thou hast none.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_18" data-id="ER4_18">The letter that ye sent unto us, explained, hath been read  before me,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_19" data-id="ER4_19">and by me a decree hath been made, and they sought, and  have found that this city from the days of old against kings is  lifting up itself, and rebellion and sedition is made in it,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_20" data-id="ER4_20">and mighty kings have been over Jerusalem, even rulers over  all beyond the river, and toll, tribute, and custom is given to  them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_21" data-id="ER4_21">`Now, make ye a decree to cause these men to cease, and  this city is not builded, till by me a decree is made.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_22" data-id="ER4_22">And beware ye of negligence in doing this; why doth the  hurt become great to the loss of the kings?'</span>

<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_24" data-id="ER4_24">then ceased the service of the house of God that [is] in  Jerusalem, and it ceased till the second year of the reign of  Darius king of Persia.</span>
