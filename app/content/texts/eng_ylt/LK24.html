<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_2" data-id="LK24_2">and they found the stone having been rolled away from the  tomb,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_3" data-id="LK24_3">and having gone in, they found not the body of the Lord  Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_4" data-id="LK24_4">And it came to pass, while they are perplexed about this,  that lo, two men stood by them in glittering apparel,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_5" data-id="LK24_5">and on their having become afraid, and having inclined the  face to the earth, they said to them, `Why do ye seek the  living with the dead?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_6" data-id="LK24_6">he is not here, but was raised; remember how he spake to  you, being yet in Galilee,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_7" data-id="LK24_7">saying -- It behoveth the Son of Man to be delivered up to  the hands of sinful men, and to be crucified, and the third day  to rise again.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_8" data-id="LK24_8">And they remembered his sayings,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_9" data-id="LK24_9">and having turned back from the tomb told all these things  to the eleven, and to all the rest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_10" data-id="LK24_10">And it was the Magdalene Mary, and Joanna, and Mary of  James, and the other women with them, who told unto the  apostles these things,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_11" data-id="LK24_11">and their sayings appeared before them as idle talk, and  they were not believing them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_12" data-id="LK24_12">And Peter having risen, did run to the tomb, and having  stooped down he seeth the linen clothes lying alone, and he  went away to his own home, wondering at that which was come to  pass.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_13" data-id="LK24_13">And, lo, two of them were going on during that day to a  village, distant sixty furlongs from Jerusalem, the name of  which [is] Emmaus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_14" data-id="LK24_14">and they were conversing with one another about all these  things that have happened.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_15" data-id="LK24_15">And it came to pass in their conversing and reasoning  together, that Jesus himself, having come nigh, was going on  with them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_16" data-id="LK24_16">and their eyes were holden so as not to know him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_17" data-id="LK24_17">and he said unto them, `What [are] these words that ye  exchange with one another, walking, and ye are sad?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_18" data-id="LK24_18">And the one, whose name was Cleopas, answering, said unto  him, `Art thou alone such a stranger in Jerusalem, that thou  hast not known the things that came to pass in it in these  days?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_19" data-id="LK24_19">And he said to them, `What things?' And they said to him,  `The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who became a man -- a  prophet -- powerful in deed and word, before God and all the  people,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_20" data-id="LK24_20">how also the chief priests and our rulers did deliver him  up to a judgment of death, and crucified him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_21" data-id="LK24_21">and we were hoping that he it is who is about to redeem  Israel, and also with all these things, this third day is  passing to-day, since these things happened.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_22" data-id="LK24_22">`And certain women of ours also astonished us, coming  early to the tomb,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_23" data-id="LK24_23">and not having found his body, they came, saying also to  have seen an apparition of messengers, who say he is alive,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_24" data-id="LK24_24">and certain of those with us went away unto the tomb, and  found as even the women said, and him they saw not.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_25" data-id="LK24_25">And he said unto them, `O inconsiderate and slow in heart,  to believe on all that the prophets spake!</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_26" data-id="LK24_26">Was it not behoving the Christ these things to suffer, and  to enter into his glory?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_27" data-id="LK24_27">and having begun from Moses, and from all the prophets, he  was expounding to them in all the Writings the things about  himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_28" data-id="LK24_28">And they came nigh to the village whither they were going,  and he made an appearance of going on further,</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_29" data-id="LK24_29">and they constrained him, saying, `Remain with us, for it  is toward evening,' and the day did decline, and he went in to  remain with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_30" data-id="LK24_30">And it came to pass, in his reclining (at meat) with them,  having taken the bread, he blessed, and having broken, he was  giving to them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_31" data-id="LK24_31">and their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and  he became unseen by them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_32" data-id="LK24_32">And they said one to another, `Was not our heart burning  within us, as he was speaking to us in the way, and as he was  opening up to us the Writings?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_33" data-id="LK24_33">And they, having risen up the same hour, turned back to  Jerusalem, and found gathered together the eleven, and those  with them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_34" data-id="LK24_34">saying -- `The Lord was raised indeed, and was seen by  Simon;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_35" data-id="LK24_35">and they were telling the things in the way, and how he  was made known to them in the breaking of the bread,</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_36" data-id="LK24_36">and as they are speaking these things, Jesus himself stood  in the midst of them, and saith to them, `Peace -- to you;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_37" data-id="LK24_37">and being amazed, and becoming affrighted, they were  thinking themselves to see a spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_38" data-id="LK24_38">And he said to them, `Why are ye troubled? and wherefore  do reasonings come up in your hearts?</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_39" data-id="LK24_39">see my hands and my feet, that I am he; handle me and see,  because a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me  having.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_40" data-id="LK24_40">And having said this, he shewed to them the hands and the  feet,</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_41" data-id="LK24_41">and while they are not believing from the joy, and  wondering, he said to them, `Have ye anything here to eat?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_42" data-id="LK24_42">and they gave to him part of a broiled fish, and of an  honeycomb,</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_43" data-id="LK24_43">and having taken, he did eat before them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_44" data-id="LK24_44">and he said to them, `These [are] the words that I spake  unto you, being yet with you, that it behoveth to be fulfilled  all the things that are written in the Law of Moses, and the  Prophets, and the Psalms, about me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_45" data-id="LK24_45">Then opened he up their understanding to understand the  Writings,</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_46" data-id="LK24_46">and he said to them -- `Thus it hath been written, and  thus it was behoving the Christ to suffer, and to rise out of  the dead the third day,</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_47" data-id="LK24_47">and reformation and remission of sins to be proclaimed in  his name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem:</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_48" data-id="LK24_48">and ye -- ye are witnesses of these things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_49" data-id="LK24_49">`And, lo, I do send the promise of my Father upon you, but  ye -- abide ye in the city of Jerusalem till ye be clothed with  power from on high.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_50" data-id="LK24_50">And he led them forth without -- unto Bethany, and having  lifted up his hands he did bless them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_51" data-id="LK24_51">and it came to pass, in his blessing them, he was parted  from them, and was borne up to the heaven;</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_52" data-id="LK24_52">and they, having bowed before him, did turn back to  Jerusalem with great joy,</span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_53" data-id="LK24_53">and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing  God. Amen.</span>
