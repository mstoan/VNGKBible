<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S124_2" data-id="S124_2">And Saul taketh three thousand chosen men out of all  Israel, and goeth to seek David and his men, on the front of  the rocks of the wild goats,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S124_3" data-id="S124_3">and he cometh in unto folds of the flock, on the way, and  there [is] a cave, and Saul goeth in to cover his feet; and  David and his men in the sides of the cave are abiding.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S124_4" data-id="S124_4">And the men of David say unto him, `Lo, the day of which  Jehovah said unto thee, Lo, I am giving thine enemy into thy  hand, and thou hast done to him as it is good in thine eyes;'  and David riseth and cutteth off the skirt of the upper robe  which [is] on Saul -- gently.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S124_5" data-id="S124_5">And it cometh to pass afterwards that the heart of David  smiteth him, because that he hath cut off the skirt which [is]  on Saul,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S124_6" data-id="S124_6">and he saith to his men, `Far be it from me, by Jehovah;  I do not do this thing to my lord -- to the anointed of  Jehovah -- to put forth my hand against him, for the anointed of  Jehovah he [is].'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S124_7" data-id="S124_7">And David subdueth his men by words, and hath not permitted  them to rise against Saul; and Saul hath risen from the cave,  and goeth on the way;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S124_8" data-id="S124_8">and David riseth afterwards, and goeth out from the cave,  and calleth after Saul, saying, `My lord, O king!' And Saul  looketh attentively behind him, and David boweth -- face to the  earth -- and doth obeisance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S124_9" data-id="S124_9">And David saith to Saul, `Why dost thou hear the words of  man, saying, Lo, David is seeking thine evil?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S124_10" data-id="S124_10">Lo, this day have thine eyes seen how that Jehovah hath  given thee to-day into my hand in the cave; and [one] said to  slay thee, and [mine eye] hath pity on thee, and I say, I do  not put forth my hand against my lord, for the anointed of  Jehovah he [is].</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S124_11" data-id="S124_11">`And, my father, see, yea see the skirt of thine upper  robe in my hand; for by cutting off the skirt of thy upper  robe, and I have not slain thee, know and see that there is not  in my hand evil and transgression, and I have not sinned  against thee, and thou art hunting my soul to take it!</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v S124_12" data-id="S124_12">`Jehovah doth judge between me and thee, and Jehovah hath  avenged me of thee, and my hand is not on thee;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S124_13" data-id="S124_13">as saith the simile of the ancients, From the wicked goeth  out wickedness, and my hand is not on thee.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v S124_16" data-id="S124_16">And it cometh to pass, when David completeth to speak  these words unto Saul, that Saul saith, `Is this thy voice, my  son David?' and Saul lifteth up his voice, and weepeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S124_17" data-id="S124_17">And he saith unto David, `More righteous thou [art] than  I; for thou hast done me good, and I have done thee evil;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v S124_18" data-id="S124_18">and thou hast declared to-day how that thou hast done good  with me, how that Jehovah shut me up into thy hand, and thou  didst not slay me,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v S124_19" data-id="S124_19">and that a man doth find his enemy, and hath sent him away  in a good manner; and Jehovah doth repay thee good for that  which thou didst to me this day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v S124_20" data-id="S124_20">`And, now, lo, I have known that thou dost certainly  reign, and the kingdom of Israel hath stood in thy hand;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v S124_21" data-id="S124_21">and, now, swear to me by Jehovah -- thou dost not cut off my  seed after me, nor dost thou destroy my name from the house of  my father.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v S124_22" data-id="S124_22">And David sweareth to Saul, and Saul goeth unto his  house, and David and his men have gone up unto the fortress.</span>
