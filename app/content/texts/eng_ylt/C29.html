<div class="c">9</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_1" data-id="C29_1">For, indeed, concerning the ministration that [is] for the  saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_2" data-id="C29_2">for I have known your readiness of mind, which in your  behalf I boast of to Macedonians, that Achaia hath been  prepared a year ago, and the zeal of you did stir up the more  part,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_3" data-id="C29_3">and I sent the brethren, that our boasting on your behalf  may not be made vain in this respect; that, according as I  said, ye may be ready,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_4" data-id="C29_4">lest if Macedonians may come with me, and find you  unprepared, we -- we may be put to shame (that we say not --  ye) in this same confidence of boasting.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_5" data-id="C29_5">Necessary, therefore, I thought [it] to exhort the brethren,  that they may go before to you, and may make up before your  formerly announced blessing, that this be ready, as a blessing,  and not as covetousness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_6" data-id="C29_6">And this: He who is sowing sparingly, sparingly also shall  reap; and he who is sowing in blessings, in blessings also  shall reap;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_7" data-id="C29_7">each one, according as he doth purpose in heart, not out of  sorrow or out of necessity, for a cheerful giver doth God love,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_8" data-id="C29_8">and God [is] able all grace to cause to abound to you, that  in every thing always all sufficiency having, ye may abound to  every good work,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_9" data-id="C29_9">(according as it hath been written, `He dispersed abroad, he  gave to the poor, his righteousness doth remain to the age,')</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_10" data-id="C29_10">and may He who is supplying seed to the sower, and bread  for food, supply and multiply your seed sown, and increase the  fruits of your righteousness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_11" data-id="C29_11">in every thing being enriched to all liberality, which doth  work through us thanksgiving to God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_12" data-id="C29_12">because the ministration of this service not only is  supplying the wants of the saints, but is also abounding  through many thanksgivings to God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_13" data-id="C29_13">through the proof of this ministration glorifying God for  the subjection of your confession to the good news of the  Christ, and [for] the liberality of the fellowship to them and  to all,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_14" data-id="C29_14">and by their supplication in your behalf, longing after you  because of the exceeding grace of God upon you;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_15" data-id="C29_15">thanks also to God for His unspeakable gift!</span>
