<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_2" data-id="LK2_2">this enrollment first came to pass when Cyrenius was  governor of Syria --</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_3" data-id="LK2_3">and all were going to be enrolled, each to his proper city,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_4" data-id="LK2_4">and Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of  Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, that is called  Bethlehem, because of his being of the house and family of  David,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_5" data-id="LK2_5">to enroll himself with Mary his betrothed wife, being with  child.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_6" data-id="LK2_6">And it came to pass, in their being there, the days were  fulfilled for her bringing forth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_7" data-id="LK2_7">and she brought forth her son -- the first-born, and wrapped  him up, and laid him down in the manger, because there was not  for them a place in the guest-chamber.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_8" data-id="LK2_8">And there were shepherds in the same region, lodging in the  field, and keeping the night-watches over their flock,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_9" data-id="LK2_9">and lo, a messenger of the Lord stood over them, and the  glory of the Lord shone around them, and they feared a great  fear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_10" data-id="LK2_10">And the messenger said to them, `Fear not, for lo, I bring  you good news of great joy, that shall be to all the people --</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_11" data-id="LK2_11">because there was born to you to-day a Saviour -- who is  Christ the Lord -- in the city of David,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_12" data-id="LK2_12">and this [is] to you the sign: Ye shall find a babe wrapped  up, lying in the manger.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_13" data-id="LK2_13">And suddenly there came with the messenger a multitude of  the heavenly host, praising God, and saying,</span>

<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_31" data-id="LK2_31">which Thou didst prepare before the face of all the  peoples,</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_32" data-id="LK2_32">a light to the uncovering of nations, and the glory of Thy  people Israel.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_33" data-id="LK2_33">And Joseph and his mother were wondering at the things  spoken concerning him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_34" data-id="LK2_34">and Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother,  `Lo, this [one] is set for the falling and rising again of many  in Israel, and for a sign spoken against --</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_35" data-id="LK2_35">(and also thine own soul shall a sword pass through) --  that the reasonings of many hearts may be revealed.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_37" data-id="LK2_37">and she [is] a widow of about eighty-four years, who did  depart not from the temple, with fasts and supplications  serving, night and day,</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_38" data-id="LK2_38">and she, at that hour, having come in, was confessing,  likewise, to the Lord, and was speaking concerning him, to all  those looking for redemption in Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_39" data-id="LK2_39">And when they finished all things, according to the Law of  the Lord, they turned back to Galilee, to their city Nazareth;</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_40" data-id="LK2_40">and the child grew and was strengthened in spirit, being  filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_41" data-id="LK2_41">And his parents were going yearly to Jerusalem, at the  feast of the passover,</span>

<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_43" data-id="LK2_43">and having finished the days, in their returning the child  Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, and Joseph and his mother  did not know,</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_44" data-id="LK2_44">and, having supposed him to be in the company, they went a  day's journey, and were seeking him among the kindred and  among the acquaintances,</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_45" data-id="LK2_45">and not having found him, they turned back to Jerusalem  seeking him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_46" data-id="LK2_46">And it came to pass, after three days, they found him in  the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing  them and questioning them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_47" data-id="LK2_47">and all those hearing him were astonished at his  understanding and answers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK2_48" data-id="LK2_48">And, having seen him, they were amazed, and his mother said  unto him, `Child, why didst thou thus to us? lo, thy father  and I, sorrowing, were seeking thee.'</span>
