<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS1_2" data-id="IS1_2">Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, For Jehovah hath  spoken: Sons I have nourished and brought up, And they -- they  transgressed against Me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS1_3" data-id="IS1_3">An ox hath known its owner, And an ass the crib of its  master, Israel hath not known, My people hath not understood.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS1_4" data-id="IS1_4">Ah, sinning nation, a people heavy [with] iniquity, A seed  of evil doers, sons -- corrupters! They have forsaken Jehovah,  They have despised the Holy One of Israel, They have gone away  backward.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS1_5" data-id="IS1_5">Wherefore are ye stricken any more? Ye do add apostacy!  Every head is become diseased, and every heart [is] sick.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS1_6" data-id="IS1_6">From the sole of the foot -- unto the head, There is no  soundness in it, Wound, and bruise, and fresh smiting! They  have not been closed nor bound, Nor have they softened with  ointment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS1_7" data-id="IS1_7">Your land [is] a desolation, your cities burnt with fire,  Your ground, before you strangers are consuming it, And a  desolation as overthrown by strangers!</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS1_8" data-id="IS1_8">And left hath been the daughter of Zion, As a booth in a  vineyard, As a lodge in a place of cucumbers -- as a city  besieged.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS1_14" data-id="IS1_14">Your new moons and your set seasons hath My soul hated,  They have been upon me for a burden, I have been weary of  bearing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS1_15" data-id="IS1_15">And in your spreading forth your hands, I hide mine eyes  from you, Also when ye increase prayer, I do not hear, Your  hands of blood have been full.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS1_16" data-id="IS1_16">Wash ye, make ye pure, Turn aside the evil of your doings,  from before Mine eyes, Cease to do evil, learn to do good.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS1_17" data-id="IS1_17">Seek judgment, make happy the oppressed, Judge the  fatherless, strive [for] the widow.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS1_18" data-id="IS1_18">Come, I pray you, and we reason, saith Jehovah, If your  sins are as scarlet, as snow they shall be white, If they are  red as crimson, as wool they shall be!</span>

<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS1_20" data-id="IS1_20">And if ye refuse, and have rebelled, [By] the sword ye are  consumed, For the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS1_21" data-id="IS1_21">How hath a faithful city become a harlot? I have filled it  [with] judgment, Righteousness lodgeth in it -- now murderers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS1_22" data-id="IS1_22">Thy silver hath become dross, Thy drink polluted with  water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS1_23" data-id="IS1_23">Thy princes [are] apostates, and companions of thieves,  Every one loving a bribe, and pursuing rewards, The fatherless  they judge not, And the plea of the widow cometh not to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS1_24" data-id="IS1_24">Therefore -- the affirmation of the Lord -- Jehovah of  Hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: Ah, I am eased of Mine  adversaries, And I am avenged of Mine enemies,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS1_25" data-id="IS1_25">And I turn back My hand upon thee, And I refine as purity  thy dross, And I turn aside all thy tin,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS1_26" data-id="IS1_26">And I give back thy judges as at the first, And thy  counsellors as in the beginning, After this thou art called, `A  city of righteousness -- a faithful city.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS1_27" data-id="IS1_27">Zion in judgment is redeemed, And her captivity in  righteousness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS1_28" data-id="IS1_28">And the destruction of transgressors and sinners [is]  together, And those forsaking Jehovah are consumed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS1_29" data-id="IS1_29">For [men] are ashamed because of the oaks That ye have  desired, And ye are confounded because of the gardens That ye  have chosen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS1_30" data-id="IS1_30">For ye are as an oak whose leaf is fading, And as a garden  that hath no water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS1_31" data-id="IS1_31">And the strong hath been for tow, And his work for a spark,  And burned have both of them together, And there is none  quenching!</span>
