<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS79_2" data-id="PS79_2">They gave the dead bodies of Thy servants Food for the  fowls of the heavens, The flesh of Thy saints For the wild  beast of the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS79_3" data-id="PS79_3">They have shed their blood As water round about Jerusalem,  And there is none burying.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS79_4" data-id="PS79_4">We have been a reproach to our neighbours, A scorn and a  derision to our surrounders.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS79_5" data-id="PS79_5">Till when, O Jehovah? art Thou angry for ever? Thy jealousy  doth burn as fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS79_6" data-id="PS79_6">Pour Thy fury on the nations who have not known Thee, And  on kingdoms that have not called in Thy name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS79_7" data-id="PS79_7">For [one] hath devoured Jacob, And his habitation they have  made desolate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS79_8" data-id="PS79_8">Remember not for us the iniquities of forefathers, Haste,  let Thy mercies go before us, For we have been very weak.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS79_9" data-id="PS79_9">Help us, O God of our salvation, Because of the honour of  Thy name, And deliver us, and cover over our sins, For Thy  name's sake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS79_10" data-id="PS79_10">Why do the nations say, `Where [is] their God?' Let be  known among the nations before our eyes, The vengeance of the  blood of Thy servants that is shed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS79_11" data-id="PS79_11">Let the groaning of the prisoner come in before Thee,  According to the greatness of Thine arm, Leave Thou the sons of  death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS79_12" data-id="PS79_12">And turn Thou back to our neighbours, Sevenfold unto their  bosom, their reproach, Wherewith they reproached Thee, O Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS79_13" data-id="PS79_13">And we, Thy people, and the flock of Thy pasture, We give  thanks to Thee to the age, To all generations we recount Thy  praise!</span>
