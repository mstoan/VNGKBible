<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG8_26" data-id="JG8_26">and the weight of the rings of gold which he asked is a  thousand and seven hundred [shekels] of gold, apart from the  round ornaments, and the drops, and the purple garments, which  [are] on the kings of Midian, and apart from the chains which  [are] on the necks of their camels,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG8_27" data-id="JG8_27">and Gideon maketh it into an ephod, and setteth it up in  his city, in Ophrah, and all Israel go a-whoring after it  there, and it is to Gideon and to his house for a snare.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG8_28" data-id="JG8_28">And Midian is humbled before the sons of Israel, and have  not added to lift up their head; and the land resteth forty  years in the days of Gideon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG8_29" data-id="JG8_29">And Jerubbaal son of Joash goeth and dwelleth in his own  house,</span>

<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG8_31" data-id="JG8_31">and his concubine, who [is] in Shechem, hath born to  him -- even she -- a son, and he appointeth his name Abimelech.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG8_32" data-id="JG8_32">And Gideon son of Joash dieth, in a good old age, and is  buried in the burying-place of Joash his father, in Ophrah of  the Abi-Ezrite.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG8_33" data-id="JG8_33">And it cometh to pass, when Gideon [is] dead, that the sons  of Israel turn back and go a-whoring after the Baalim, and set  over them Baal-Berith for a god;</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG8_34" data-id="JG8_34">and the sons of Israel have not remembered Jehovah their  God, who is delivering them out of the hand of all their  enemies round about,</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG8_35" data-id="JG8_35">neither have they done kindness with the house of  Jerubbaal -- Gideon -- according to all the good which he did with  Israel.</span>
