<div class="c">21</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR21_1" data-id="JR21_1">The word that hath been unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, in the  king Zedekiah's sending unto him Pashhur son of Malchiah, and  Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR21_2" data-id="JR21_2">`Inquire, we pray thee, for us at Jehovah, for  Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath fought against us; perhaps  Jehovah doth deal with us according to all His wonders, and  doth cause him to go up from off us.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR21_3" data-id="JR21_3">And Jeremiah saith unto them, `Thus do ye say unto  Zedekiah,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR21_4" data-id="JR21_4">Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel: Lo, I am turning round  the weapons of battle That [are] in your hand, With which ye do  fight the king of Babylon, And the Chaldeans, who are laying  siege against you, At the outside of the wall, And I have  gathered them into the midst of this city,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR21_5" data-id="JR21_5">And I -- I have fought against you, With a stretched-out  hand, and with a strong arm, And in anger, and in fury, and in  great wrath,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR21_6" data-id="JR21_6">And I have smitten the inhabitants of this city, Both man  and beast, By a great pestilence do they die.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR21_7" data-id="JR21_7">And after this -- an affirmation of Jehovah, I give  Zedekiah king of Judah, And his servants, and the people, And  those left in this city, From the pestilence, from the sword,  and from the famine, Into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of  Babylon, And into the hand of their enemies, And into the hand  of those seeking their life, And he hath smitten them by the  mouth of the sword, He hath no pity on them, Nor doth he spare,  nor hath he mercy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR21_8" data-id="JR21_8">And unto this people thou dost say, Thus said Jehovah: Lo,  I am setting before you the way of life, And the way of death!</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR21_9" data-id="JR21_9">Whoso is abiding in this city -- dieth, By sword, and by  famine, and by pestilence, And whoso is going forth, And hath  fallen unto the Chaldeans, Who are laying siege against you --  liveth, And his life hath been to him for a spoil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR21_10" data-id="JR21_10">For I have set My face against this city for evil, And not  for good -- an affirmation of Jehovah. Into the hand of the  king of Babylon it is given, And he hath burned it with fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR21_11" data-id="JR21_11">And as to the house of the king of Judah, Hear ye a word  of Jehovah;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR21_12" data-id="JR21_12">O house of David, thus said Jehovah: Decide ye judgment at  morning, And deliver the plundered from the hand of the  oppressor, Lest My fury go forth as fire, And hath burned, and  none is quenching, Because of the evil of your doings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR21_13" data-id="JR21_13">Lo, I [am] against thee -- an affirmation of Jehovah, O  inhabitant of the valley, rock of the plain, Who are saying,  Who cometh down against us? And who cometh into our  habitations?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR21_14" data-id="JR21_14">And I have laid a charge against you, According to the  fruit of your doings, An affirmation of Jehovah, And I have  kindled a fire in its forest, And it hath consumed -- all its  suburbs!</span>
