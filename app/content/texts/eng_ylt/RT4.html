<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT4_2" data-id="RT4_2">And he taketh ten men of the elders of the city, and saith,  `Sit down here;' and they sit down.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT4_3" data-id="RT4_3">And he saith to the redeemer, `A portion of the field which  [is] to our brother, to Elimelech, hath Naomi sold, who hath  come back from the fields of Moab;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT4_4" data-id="RT4_4">and I said, I uncover thine ear, saying, Buy before the  inhabitants, and before the elders of my people; if thou dost  redeem -- redeem, and if none doth redeem -- declare to me, and I  know, for there is none save thee to redeem, and I after thee.'  And he saith, I redeem [it].'</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT4_7" data-id="RT4_7">And this [is] formerly in Israel for redemption and for  changing, to establish anything: a man hath drawn off his  sandal, and given [it] to his neighbour, and this [is] the  testimony in Israel.</span>
