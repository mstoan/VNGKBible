<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_2" data-id="MT22_2">`The reign of the heavens was likened to a man, a king, who  made marriage-feasts for his son,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_3" data-id="MT22_3">and he sent forth his servants to call those having been  called to the marriage-feasts, and they were not willing to  come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_4" data-id="MT22_4">`Again he sent forth other servants, saying, Say to those  who have been called: Lo, my dinner I prepared, my oxen and the  fatlings have been killed, and all things [are] ready, come ye  to the marriage-feasts;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_5" data-id="MT22_5">and they, having disregarded [it], went away, the one to  his own field, and the other to his merchandise;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_6" data-id="MT22_6">and the rest, having laid hold on his servants, did insult  and slay [them].</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_7" data-id="MT22_7">`And the king having heard, was wroth, and having sent  forth his soldiers, he destroyed those murderers, and their  city he set on fire;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_8" data-id="MT22_8">then saith he to his servants, The marriage-feast indeed is  ready, and those called were not worthy,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_9" data-id="MT22_9">be going, then, on to the cross-ways, and as many as ye may  find, call ye to the marriage-feasts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_10" data-id="MT22_10">`And those servants, having gone forth to the ways, did  gather all, as many as they found, both bad and good, and the  marriage-feast apartment was filled with those reclining.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_11" data-id="MT22_11">`And the king having come in to view those reclining, saw  there a man not clothed with clothing of the marriage-feast,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_12" data-id="MT22_12">and he saith to him, Comrade, how didst thou come in  hither, not having clothing of the marriage-feast? and he was  speechless.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_13" data-id="MT22_13">`Then said the king to the ministrants, Having bound his  feet and hands, take him up and cast forth to the outer  darkness, there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the  teeth;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_14" data-id="MT22_14">for many are called, and few chosen.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_15" data-id="MT22_15">Then the Pharisees having gone, took counsel how they  might ensnare him in words,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_16" data-id="MT22_16">and they send to him their disciples with the Herodians,  saying, `Teacher, we have known that thou art true, and the way  of God in truth thou dost teach, and thou art not caring for  any one, for thou dost not look to the face of men;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_17" data-id="MT22_17">tell us, therefore, what dost thou think? is it lawful to  give tribute to Caesar or not?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_18" data-id="MT22_18">And Jesus having known their wickedness, said, `Why me do  ye tempt, hypocrites?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_19" data-id="MT22_19">show me the tribute-coin?' and they brought to him a  denary;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_20" data-id="MT22_20">and he saith to them, `Whose [is] this image and the  inscription?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_21" data-id="MT22_21">they say to him, `Caesar's;' then saith he to them,  `Render therefore the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the  things of God to God;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_22" data-id="MT22_22">and having heard they wondered, and having left him they  went away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_23" data-id="MT22_23">In that day there came near to him Sadducees, who are  saying there is not a rising again, and they questioned him,  saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_24" data-id="MT22_24">`Teacher, Moses said, If any one may die not having  children, his brother shall marry his wife, and shall raise up  seed to his brother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_25" data-id="MT22_25">`And there were with us seven brothers, and the first  having married did die, and not having seed, he left his wife  to his brother;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_26" data-id="MT22_26">in like manner also the second, and the third, unto the  seventh,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_27" data-id="MT22_27">and last of all died also the woman;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_28" data-id="MT22_28">therefore in the rising again, of which of the seven shall  she be wife -- for all had her?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_29" data-id="MT22_29">And Jesus answering said to them, `Ye go astray, not  knowing the Writings, nor the power of God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_30" data-id="MT22_30">for in the rising again they do not marry, nor are they  given in marriage, but are as messengers of God in heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_31" data-id="MT22_31">`And concerning the rising again of the dead, did ye not  read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_32" data-id="MT22_32">I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God  of Jacob? God is not a God of dead men, but of living.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_33" data-id="MT22_33">And having heard, the multitudes were astonished at his  teaching;</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_34" data-id="MT22_34">and the Pharisees, having heard that he did silence the  Sadducees, were gathered together unto him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_35" data-id="MT22_35">and one of them, a lawyer, did question, tempting him, and  saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_36" data-id="MT22_36">`Teacher, which [is] the great command in the Law?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_37" data-id="MT22_37">And Jesus said to him, `Thou shalt love the Lord thy God  with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thine  understanding --</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_38" data-id="MT22_38">this is a first and great command;</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_39" data-id="MT22_39">and the second [is] like to it, Thou shalt love thy  neighbor as thyself;</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_40" data-id="MT22_40">on these -- the two commands -- all the law and the  prophets do hang.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_41" data-id="MT22_41">And the Pharisees having been gathered together, Jesus did  question them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_42" data-id="MT22_42">saying, `What do ye think concerning the Christ? of whom  is he son?' They say to him, `Of David.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_43" data-id="MT22_43">He saith to them, `How then doth David in the Spirit call  him lord, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_44" data-id="MT22_44">The Lord said to my lord, Sit at my right hand, till I may  make thine enemies thy footstool?</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_45" data-id="MT22_45">If then David doth call him lord, how is he his son?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_46" data-id="MT22_46">And no one was able to answer him a word, nor durst any  from that day question him any more.</span>
