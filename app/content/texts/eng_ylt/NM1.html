<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM1_2" data-id="NM1_2">A God zealous and avenging [is] Jehovah, An avenger [is]  Jehovah, and possessing fury. An avenger [is] Jehovah on His  adversaries, And He is watching for His enemies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM1_3" data-id="NM1_3">Jehovah [is] slow to anger, and great in power, And Jehovah  doth not entirely acquit, In a hurricane and in a tempest [is]  His way, And a cloud [is] the dust of His feet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM1_4" data-id="NM1_4">He is pushing against a sea, and drieth it up, Yea, all the  floods He hath made dry, Languishing [are] Bashan and Carmel,  Yea, the flower of Lebanon [is] languishing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM1_5" data-id="NM1_5">Mountains have shaken because of Him, And the hills have  been melted; And lifted up [is] the earth at His presence, And  the world and all dwelling in it.</span>

Celebrate, O Judah, thy festivals, complete thy  vows, For add no more to pass over into thee doth the  worthless, He hath been completely cut off!</span>
