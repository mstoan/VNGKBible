<div class="c">27</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_1" data-id="AC27_1">And when our sailing to Italy was determined, they were  delivering up both Paul and certain others, prisoners, to a  centurion, by name Julius, of the band of Sebastus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_2" data-id="AC27_2">and having embarked in a ship of Adramyttium, we, being  about to sail by the coasts of Asia, did set sail, there being  with us Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_3" data-id="AC27_3">on the next [day] also we touched at Sidon, and Julius,  courteously treating Paul, did permit [him], having gone on  unto friends, to receive [their] care.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_4" data-id="AC27_4">And thence, having set sail, we sailed under Cyprus,  because of the winds being contrary,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_5" data-id="AC27_5">and having sailed over the sea over-against Cilicia and  Pamphylia, we came to Myria of Lycia,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_6" data-id="AC27_6">and there the centurion having found a ship of Alexandria,  sailing to Italy, did put us into it,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_7" data-id="AC27_7">and having sailed slowly many days, and with difficulty  coming over-against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we  sailed under Crete, over-against Salmone,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_8" data-id="AC27_8">and hardly passing it, we came to a certain place called  `Fair Havens,' nigh to which was the city [of] Lasaea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_9" data-id="AC27_9">And much time being spent, and the sailing being now  dangerous -- because of the fast also being already past --  Paul was admonishing,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_10" data-id="AC27_10">saying to them, `Men, I perceive that with hurt, and much  damage, not only of the lading and of the ship, but also of  our lives -- the voyage is about to be;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_11" data-id="AC27_11">but the centurion to the pilot and to the shipowner gave  credence more than to the things spoken by Paul;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_12" data-id="AC27_12">and the haven being incommodious to winter in, the more  part gave counsel to sail thence also, if by any means they  might be able, having attained to Phenice, [there] to winter,  [which is] a haven of Crete, looking to the south-west and  north-west,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_13" data-id="AC27_13">and a south wind blowing softly, having thought they had  obtained [their] purpose, having lifted anchor, they sailed  close by Crete,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_14" data-id="AC27_14">and not long after there arose against it a tempestuous  wind, that is called Euroclydon,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_15" data-id="AC27_15">and the ship being caught, and not being able to bear up  against the wind, having given [her] up, we were borne on,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_16" data-id="AC27_16">and having run under a certain little isle, called Clauda,  we were hardly able to become masters of the boat,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_17" data-id="AC27_17">which having taken up, they were using helps, undergirding  the ship, and fearing lest they may fall on the quicksand,  having let down the mast -- so were borne on.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_18" data-id="AC27_18">And we, being exceedingly tempest-tossed, the succeeding  [day] they were making a clearing,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_19" data-id="AC27_19">and on the third [day] with our own hands the tackling of  the ship we cast out,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_20" data-id="AC27_20">and neither sun nor stars appearing for more days, and not  a little tempest lying upon us, thenceforth all hope was taken  away of our being saved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_21" data-id="AC27_21">And there having been long fasting, then Paul having stood  in the midst of them, said, `It behoved [you], indeed, O men  -- having hearkened to me -- not to set sail from Crete, and to  save this hurt and damage;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_22" data-id="AC27_22">and now I exhort you to be of good cheer, for there shall  be no loss of life among you -- but of the ship;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_23" data-id="AC27_23">for there stood by me this night a messenger of God --  whose I am, and whom I serve --</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_24" data-id="AC27_24">saying, Be not afraid Paul; before Caesar it behoveth thee  to stand; and, lo, God hath granted to thee all those sailing  with thee;</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_25" data-id="AC27_25">wherefore be of good cheer, men! for I believe God, that  so it shall be, even as it hath been spoken to me,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_26" data-id="AC27_26">and on a certain island it behoveth us to be cast.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_27" data-id="AC27_27">And when the fourteenth night came -- we being borne up  and down in the Adria -- toward the middle of the night the  sailors were supposing that some country drew nigh to them;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_28" data-id="AC27_28">and having sounded they found twenty fathoms, and having  gone a little farther, and again having sounded, they found  fifteen fathoms,</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_29" data-id="AC27_29">and fearing lest on rough places we may fall, out of the  stern having cast four anchors, they were wishing day to come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_30" data-id="AC27_30">And the sailors seeking to flee out of the ship, and  having let down the boat to the sea, in pretence as [if] out of  the foreship they are about to cast anchors,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_31" data-id="AC27_31">Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, `If these  do not remain in the ship -- ye are not able to be saved;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_32" data-id="AC27_32">then the soldiers did cut off the ropes of the boat, and  suffered it to fall off.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_33" data-id="AC27_33">And till the day was about to be, Paul was calling upon  all to partake of nourishment, saying, `Fourteen days to-day,  waiting, ye continue fasting, having taken nothing,</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_34" data-id="AC27_34">wherefore I call upon you to take nourishment, for this is  for your safety, for of not one of you shall a hair from the  head fall;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_35" data-id="AC27_35">and having said these things, and having taken bread, he  gave thanks to God before all, and having broken [it], he began  to eat;</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_36" data-id="AC27_36">and all having become of good cheer, themselves also took  food,</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_37" data-id="AC27_37">(and we were -- all the souls in the ship -- two hundred,  seventy and six),</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_38" data-id="AC27_38">and having eaten sufficient nourishment, they were  lightening the ship, casting forth the wheat into the sea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_39" data-id="AC27_39">And when the day came, they were not discerning the land,  but a certain creek were perceiving having a beach, into which  they took counsel, if possible, to thrust forward the ship,</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_40" data-id="AC27_40">and the anchors having taken up, they were committing [it]  to the sea, at the same time -- having loosed the bands of the  rudders, and having hoisted up the mainsail to the wind -- they  were making for the shore,</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_41" data-id="AC27_41">and having fallen into a place of two seas, they ran the  ship aground, and the fore-part, indeed, having stuck fast,  did remain immoveable, but the hinder-part was broken by the  violence of the waves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_42" data-id="AC27_42">And the soldiers' counsel was that they should kill the  prisoners, lest any one having swam out should escape,</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_43" data-id="AC27_43">but the centurion, wishing to save Paul, hindered them  from the counsel, and did command those able to swim, having  cast themselves out first -- to get unto the land,</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC27_44" data-id="AC27_44">and the rest, some indeed upon boards, and some upon  certain things of the ship; and thus it came to pass that all  came safe unto the land.</span>
