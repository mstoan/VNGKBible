<div class="c">10</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_1" data-id="RM10_1">Brethren, the pleasure indeed of my heart, and my  supplication that [is] to God for Israel, is -- for salvation;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_2" data-id="RM10_2">for I bear them testimony that they have a zeal of God, but  not according to knowledge,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_3" data-id="RM10_3">for not knowing the righteousness of God, and their own  righteousness seeking to establish, to the righteousness of God  they did not submit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_4" data-id="RM10_4">For Christ is an end of law for righteousness to every one  who is believing,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_5" data-id="RM10_5">for Moses doth describe the righteousness that [is] of the  law, that, `The man who did them shall live in them,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_6" data-id="RM10_6">and the righteousness of faith doth thus speak: `Thou  mayest not say in thine heart, Who shall go up to the heaven,'  that is, Christ to bring down?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_7" data-id="RM10_7">or, `Who shall go down to the abyss,' that is, Christ out  of the dead to bring up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_8" data-id="RM10_8">But what doth it say? `Nigh thee is the saying -- in thy  mouth, and in thy heart:' that is, the saying of the faith,  that we preach;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_9" data-id="RM10_9">that if thou mayest confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus,  and mayest believe in thy heart that God did raise him out of  the dead, thou shalt be saved,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_10" data-id="RM10_10">for with the heart doth [one] believe to righteousness,  and with the mouth is confession made to salvation;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_11" data-id="RM10_11">for the Writing saith, `Every one who is believing on him  shall not be ashamed,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_12" data-id="RM10_12">for there is no difference between Jew and Greek, for the  same Lord of all [is] rich to all those calling upon Him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_13" data-id="RM10_13">for every one -- whoever shall call upon the name of the  Lord, he shall be saved.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_14" data-id="RM10_14">How then shall they call upon [him] in whom they did not  believe? and how shall they believe [on him] of whom they did  not hear? and how shall they hear apart from one preaching?</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_15" data-id="RM10_15">and how shall they preach, if they may not be sent?  according as it hath been written, `How beautiful the feet of  those proclaiming good tidings of peace, of those proclaiming  good tidings of the good things!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_16" data-id="RM10_16">But they were not all obedient to the good tidings, for  Isaiah saith, `Lord, who did give credence to our report?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_17" data-id="RM10_17">so then the faith [is] by a report, and the report through  a saying of God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_18" data-id="RM10_18">but I say, Did they not hear? yes, indeed -- `to all the  earth their voice went forth, and to the ends of the habitable  world their sayings.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_19" data-id="RM10_19">But I say, Did not Israel know? first Moses saith, `I will  provoke you to jealousy by [that which is] not a nation; by an  unintelligent nation I will anger you,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_20" data-id="RM10_20">and Isaiah is very bold, and saith, `I was found by those  not seeking Me; I became manifest to those not inquiring after  Me;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_21" data-id="RM10_21">and unto Israel He saith, `All the day I did stretch out  My hands unto a people unbelieving and gainsaying.'</span>
