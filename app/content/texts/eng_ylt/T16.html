<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_2" data-id="T16_2">and those having believing masters, let them not slight  [them], because they are brethren, but rather let them serve,  because they are stedfast and beloved, who of the benefit are  partaking. These things be teaching and exhorting;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_3" data-id="T16_3">if any one be teaching otherwise, and do not consent to  sound words -- those of our Lord Jesus Christ -- and to the  teaching according to piety,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_4" data-id="T16_4">he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and  word-striving, out of which doth come envy, strife,  evil-speakings, evil-surmisings,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_5" data-id="T16_5">wranglings of men wholly corrupted in mind, and destitute of  the truth, supposing the piety to be gain; depart from such;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_6" data-id="T16_6">but it is great gain -- the piety with contentment;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_7" data-id="T16_7">for nothing did we bring into the world -- [it is] manifest  that we are able to carry nothing out;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_8" data-id="T16_8">but having food and raiment -- with these we shall suffice  ourselves;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_9" data-id="T16_9">and those wishing to be rich, do fall into temptation and a  snare, and many desires, foolish and hurtful, that sink men  into ruin and destruction,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_10" data-id="T16_10">for a root of all the evils is the love of money, which  certain longing for did go astray from the faith, and  themselves did pierce through with many sorrows;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_11" data-id="T16_11">and thou, O man of God, these things flee, and pursue  righteousness, piety, faith, love, endurance, meekness;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_12" data-id="T16_12">be striving the good strife of the faith, be laying hold on  the life age-during, to which also thou wast called, and didst  profess the right profession before many witnesses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_13" data-id="T16_13">I charge thee, before God, who is making all things alive,  and of Christ Jesus, who did testify before Pontius Pilate the  right profession,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_14" data-id="T16_14">that thou keep the command unspotted, unblameable, till the  manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_15" data-id="T16_15">which in His own times He shall shew -- the blessed and  only potentate, the King of the kings and Lord of the lords,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T16_16" data-id="T16_16">who only is having immortality, dwelling in light  unapproachable, whom no one of men did see, nor is able to  see, to whom [is] honour and might age-during! Amen.</span>
