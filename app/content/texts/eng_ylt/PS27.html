<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS27_2" data-id="PS27_2">When evil doers come near to me to eat my flesh, My  adversaries and mine enemies to me, They have stumbled and  fallen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS27_3" data-id="PS27_3">Though a host doth encamp against me, My heart doth not  fear, Though war riseth up against me, In this I [am]  confident.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS27_4" data-id="PS27_4">One [thing] I asked of Jehovah -- it I seek. My dwelling in  the house of Jehovah, All the days of my life, To look on the  pleasantness of Jehovah, And to inquire in His temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS27_5" data-id="PS27_5">For He hideth me in a tabernacle in the day of evil, He  hideth me in a secret place of His tent, On a rock he raiseth  me up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS27_6" data-id="PS27_6">And now, lifted up is my head, Above my enemies -- my  surrounders, And I sacrifice in His tent sacrifices of  shouting, I sing, yea, I sing praise to Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS27_7" data-id="PS27_7">Hear, O Jehovah, my voice -- I call, And favour me, and  answer me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS27_8" data-id="PS27_8">To Thee said my heart `They sought my face, Thy face, O  Jehovah, I seek.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS27_9" data-id="PS27_9">Hide not Thy face from me, Turn not aside in anger Thy  servant, My help Thou hast been. Leave me not, nor forsake me,  O God of my salvation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS27_10" data-id="PS27_10">When my father and my mother Have forsaken me, then doth  Jehovah gather me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS27_11" data-id="PS27_11">Shew me, O Jehovah, Thy way, And lead me in a path of  uprightness, For the sake of my beholders.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS27_12" data-id="PS27_12">Give me not to the will of my adversaries, For risen  against me have false witnesses, And they breathe out violence  to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS27_13" data-id="PS27_13">I had not believed to look on the goodness of Jehovah In  the land of the living!</span>
