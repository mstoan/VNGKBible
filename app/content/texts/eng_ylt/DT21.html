<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_2" data-id="DT21_2">then have thine elders and thy judges gone out and measured  unto the cities which [are] round about the slain one,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_3" data-id="DT21_3">and it hath been, the city which [is] near unto the slain  one, even the elders of that city have taken a heifer of the  herd, which hath not been wrought with, which hath not drawn in  the yoke,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_4" data-id="DT21_4">and the elders of that city have brought down the heifer  unto a hard valley, which is not tilled nor sown, and have  beheaded there the heifer in the valley.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_5" data-id="DT21_5">`And the priests, sons of Levi, have come nigh -- for on  them hath Jehovah thy God fixed to serve Him, and to bless in  the name of Jehovah, and by their mouth is every strife, and  every stroke --</span>

<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_19" data-id="DT21_19">then laid hold on him have his father and his mother, and  they have brought him out unto the elders of his city, and unto  the gate of his place,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_20" data-id="DT21_20">and have said unto the elders of his city, Our son -- this  one -- is apostatizing and rebellious; he is not hearkening to  our voice -- a glutton and drunkard;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_21" data-id="DT21_21">and all the men of his city have stoned him with stones,  and he hath died, and thou hast put away the evil out of thy  midst, and all Israel do hear and fear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_22" data-id="DT21_22">`And when there is in a man a sin -- a cause of death, and  he hath been put to death, and thou hast hanged him on a tree,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_23" data-id="DT21_23">his corpse doth not remain on the tree, for thou dost  certainly bury him in that day -- for a thing lightly esteemed  of God [is] the hanged one -- and thou dost not defile thy  ground which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee -- an  inheritance.</span>
