<div class="c">3</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_1" data-id="GL3_1">O thoughtless Galatians, who did bewitch you, not to obey  the truth -- before whose eyes Jesus Christ was described  before among you crucified?</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_2" data-id="GL3_2">this only do I wish to learn from you -- by works of law the  Spirit did ye receive, or by the hearing of faith?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_3" data-id="GL3_3">so thoughtless are ye! having begun in the Spirit, now in  the flesh do ye end?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_4" data-id="GL3_4">so many things did ye suffer in vain! if, indeed, even in  vain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_5" data-id="GL3_5">He, therefore, who is supplying to you the Spirit, and  working mighty acts among you -- by works of law or by the  hearing of faith [is it]?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_6" data-id="GL3_6">according as Abraham did believe God, and it was reckoned to  him -- to righteousness;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_7" data-id="GL3_7">know ye, then, that those of faith -- these are sons of  Abraham,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_8" data-id="GL3_8">and the Writing having foreseen that by faith God doth  declare righteous the nations did proclaim before the good news  to Abraham --</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_9" data-id="GL3_9">`Blessed in thee shall be all the nations;' so that those of  faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_10" data-id="GL3_10">for as many as are of works of law are under a curse, for  it hath been written, `Cursed [is] every one who is not  remaining in all things that have been written in the Book of  the Law -- to do them,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_11" data-id="GL3_11">and that in law no one is declared righteous with God, is  evident, because `The righteous by faith shall live;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_12" data-id="GL3_12">and the law is not by faith, but -- `The man who did them  shall live in them.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_13" data-id="GL3_13">Christ did redeem us from the curse of the law, having  become for us a curse, for it hath been written, `Cursed is  every one who is hanging on a tree,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_14" data-id="GL3_14">that to the nations the blessing of Abraham may come in  Christ Jesus, that the promise of the Spirit we may receive  through the faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_15" data-id="GL3_15">Brethren, as a man I say [it], even of man a confirmed  covenant no one doth make void or doth add to,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_16" data-id="GL3_16">and to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed;  He doth not say, `And to seeds,' as of many, but as of one,  `And to thy seed,' which is Christ;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_17" data-id="GL3_17">and this I say, A covenant confirmed before by God to  Christ, the law, that came four hundred and thirty years after,  doth not set aside, to make void the promise,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_18" data-id="GL3_18">for if by law [be] the inheritance, [it is] no more by  promise, but to Abraham through promise did God grant [it].</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_19" data-id="GL3_19">Why, then, the law? on account of the transgressions it was  added, till the seed might come to which the promise hath been  made, having been set in order through messengers in the hand  of a mediator --</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_20" data-id="GL3_20">and the mediator is not of one, and God is one --</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_21" data-id="GL3_21">the law, then, [is] against the promises of God? -- let it  not be! for if a law was given that was able to make alive,  truly by law there would have been the righteousness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_22" data-id="GL3_22">but the Writing did shut up the whole under sin, that the  promise by faith of Jesus Christ may be given to those  believing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_23" data-id="GL3_23">And before the coming of the faith, under law we were being  kept, shut up to the faith about to be revealed,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_24" data-id="GL3_24">so that the law became our child-conductor -- to Christ,  that by faith we may be declared righteous,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_25" data-id="GL3_25">and the faith having come, no more under a child-conductor  are we,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_26" data-id="GL3_26">for ye are all sons of God through the faith in Christ  Jesus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_27" data-id="GL3_27">for as many as to Christ were baptized did put on Christ;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_28" data-id="GL3_28">there is not here Jew or Greek, there is not here servant  nor freeman, there is not here male and female, for all ye are  one in Christ Jesus;</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_29" data-id="GL3_29">and if ye [are] of Christ then of Abraham ye are seed, and  according to promise -- heirs.</span>
