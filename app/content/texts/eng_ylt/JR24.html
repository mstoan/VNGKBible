<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR24_2" data-id="JR24_2">In the one basket [are] figs very good, like the first-ripe  figs, and in the other basket [are] figs very bad, that are not  eaten for badness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR24_3" data-id="JR24_3">And Jehovah saith unto me, `What art thou seeing,  Jeremiah?' and I say, `Figs, the good figs [are] very good, and  the bad [are] very bad, that are not eaten for badness.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR24_4" data-id="JR24_4">And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR24_5" data-id="JR24_5">Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, Like these good figs so  do I acknowledge The removed of Judah -- that I sent from this  place, [To] the land of the Chaldeans -- for good.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR24_6" data-id="JR24_6">And I have set Mine eyes on them for good, And have brought  them back to this land, And built them up, and I throw not  down, And have planted them, and pluck not up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR24_7" data-id="JR24_7">And have given to them a heart to know Me, For I [am]  Jehovah, And they have been to Me for a people, And I am to  them for God, For they turned back unto Me with all their  heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR24_8" data-id="JR24_8">And like the bad figs, that are not eaten for badness,  Surely thus said Jehovah: So do I make Zedekiah king of Judah,  And his heads, and the remnant of Jerusalem, Who are left in  this land, And who are dwelling in the land of Egypt,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR24_9" data-id="JR24_9">And I have given them for a trembling, For evil -- to all  kingdoms of the earth, For a reproach, and for a simile, For a  byword, and for a reviling, In all the places whither I drive  them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR24_10" data-id="JR24_10">And I have sent against them the sword, The famine and the  pestilence, Till their consumption from off the ground, That I  gave to them and to their fathers!</span>
