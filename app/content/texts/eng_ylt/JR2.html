<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR2_8" data-id="JR2_8">The priests have not said, `Where [is] Jehovah?' And those  handling the law have not known Me.

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR2_13" data-id="JR2_13">For two evils hath My people done, Me they have forsaken, a  fountain of living waters, To hew out for themselves wells --  broken wells, That contain not the waters.</span>

<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR2_24" data-id="JR2_24">A wild ass accustomed to a wilderness, In the desire of her  soul she hath swallowed up wind, Her meeting -- who doth turn  her back? None seeking her do weary themselves, In her month  they find her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR2_25" data-id="JR2_25">Withhold thy foot from being unshod, And thy throat from  thirst, And thou sayest, `It is incurable, No, for I have loved  strangers, and after them I go.'</span>
