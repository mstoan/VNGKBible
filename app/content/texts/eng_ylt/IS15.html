<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS15_2" data-id="IS15_2">He hath gone up to Bajith and Dibon, The high places -- to  weep, On Nebo and on Medeba Moab howleth, On all its heads [is]  baldness, every beard cut off.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS15_3" data-id="IS15_3">In its out-places they girded on sackcloth, On its  pinnacles, and in its broad places, Every one howleth -- going  down with weeping.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS15_4" data-id="IS15_4">And cry doth Heshbon and Elealeh, Unto Jahaz heard hath  been their voice, Therefore the armed ones of Moab do shout,  His life hath been grievous to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS15_5" data-id="IS15_5">My heart [is] toward Moab, Cry do her fugitives unto Zoar,  a heifer of the third [year], For -- the ascent of Luhith --  With weeping he goeth up in it, For, in the way of Horonaim, A  cry of destruction they wake up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS15_6" data-id="IS15_6">For, the waters of Nimrim are desolations, For, withered  hath been the hay, Finished hath been the tender grass, A green  thing there hath not been.</span>
