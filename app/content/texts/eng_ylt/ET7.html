<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET7_2" data-id="ET7_2">and the king saith to Esther also on the second day, during  the banquet of wine, `What [is] thy petition, Esther, O queen?  and it is given to thee; and what thy request? unto the half of  the kingdom -- and it is done.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET7_3" data-id="ET7_3">And Esther the queen answereth and saith, `If I have found  grace in thine eyes, O king, and if to the king [it be] good,  let my life be given to me at my petition, and my people at my  request;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET7_4" data-id="ET7_4">for we have been sold, I and my people, to cut off, to slay,  and to destroy; and if for men-servants and for maid-servants  we had been sold I had kept silent -- but the adversity is not  equal to the loss of the king.'</span>
