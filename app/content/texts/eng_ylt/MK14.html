<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_2" data-id="MK14_2">and they said, `Not in the feast, lest there shall be a  tumult of the people.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_3" data-id="MK14_3">And he, being in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,  at his reclining (at meat), there came a woman having an  alabaster box of ointment, of spikenard, very precious, and  having broken the alabaster box, did pour on his head;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_4" data-id="MK14_4">and there were certain much displeased within themselves,  and saying, `For what hath this waste of the ointment been  made?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_5" data-id="MK14_5">for this could have been sold for more than three hundred  denaries, and given to the poor;' and they were murmuring at  her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_6" data-id="MK14_6">And Jesus said, `Let her alone; why are ye giving her  trouble? a good work she wrought on me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_7" data-id="MK14_7">for the poor always ye have with you, and whenever ye may  will ye are able to do them good, but me ye have not always;</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_9" data-id="MK14_9">Verily I say to you, wherever this good news may be  proclaimed in the whole world, what also this woman did shall  be spoken of -- for a memorial of her.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_10" data-id="MK14_10">And Judas the Iscariot, one of the twelve, went away unto  the chief priests that he might deliver him up to them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_11" data-id="MK14_11">and having heard, they were glad, and promised to give him  money, and he was seeking how, conveniently, he might deliver  him up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_12" data-id="MK14_12">And the first day of the unleavened food, when they were  killing the passover, his disciples say to him, `Where wilt  thou, [that,] having gone, we may prepare, that thou mayest eat  the passover?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_13" data-id="MK14_13">And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith to  them, `Go ye away to the city, and there shall meet you a man  bearing a pitcher of water, follow him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_14" data-id="MK14_14">and wherever he may go in, say ye to the master of the  house -- The Teacher saith, Where is the guest-chamber, where  the passover, with my disciples, I may eat?</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_15" data-id="MK14_15">and he will shew you a large upper room, furnished,  prepared -- there make ready for us.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_19" data-id="MK14_19">And they began to be sorrowful, and to say to him, one by  one, `Is it I?' and another, `Is it I?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_20" data-id="MK14_20">And he answering said to them, `One of the twelve who is  dipping with me in the dish;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_21" data-id="MK14_21">the Son of Man doth indeed go, as it hath been written  concerning him, but wo to that man through whom the Son of Man  is delivered up; good were it to him if that man had not been  born.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_22" data-id="MK14_22">And as they are eating, Jesus having taken bread, having  blessed, brake, and gave to them, and said, `Take, eat; this is  my body.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_23" data-id="MK14_23">And having taken the cup, having given thanks, he gave to  them, and they drank of it -- all;</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_24" data-id="MK14_24">and he said to them, `This is my blood of the new  covenant, which for many is being poured out;</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_25" data-id="MK14_25">verily I say to you, that no more may I drink of the  produce of the vine till that day when I may drink it new in  the reign of God.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_26" data-id="MK14_26">And having sung an hymn, they went forth to the mount of  the Olives,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_27" data-id="MK14_27">and Jesus saith to them -- `All ye shall be stumbled at me  this night, because it hath been written, I will smite the  shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered abroad,</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_28" data-id="MK14_28">but after my having risen I will go before you to  Galilee.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_29" data-id="MK14_29">And Peter said to him, `And if all shall be stumbled, yet  not I;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_30" data-id="MK14_30">And Jesus said to him, `Verily I say to thee, that to-day,  this night, before a cock shall crow twice, thrice thou shalt  deny me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_31" data-id="MK14_31">And he spake the more vehemently, `If it may be necessary  for me to die with thee -- I will in nowise deny thee;' and in  like manner also said they all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_32" data-id="MK14_32">And they come to a spot, the name of which [is]  Gethsemane, and he saith to his disciples, `Sit ye here till I  may pray;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_33" data-id="MK14_33">and he taketh Peter, and James, and John with him, and  began to be amazed, and to be very heavy,</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_34" data-id="MK14_34">and he saith to them, `Exceeding sorrowful is my soul --  to death; remain here, and watch.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_35" data-id="MK14_35">And having gone forward a little, he fell upon the earth,  and was praying, that, if it be possible the hour may pass from  him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_36" data-id="MK14_36">and he said, `Abba, Father; all things are possible to  Thee; make this cup pass from me; but, not what I will, but  what Thou.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_37" data-id="MK14_37">And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith to  Peter, `Simon, thou dost sleep! thou wast not able to watch  one hour!</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_38" data-id="MK14_38">Watch ye and pray, that ye may not enter into temptation;  the spirit indeed is forward, but the flesh weak.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_39" data-id="MK14_39">And again having gone away, he prayed, the same word  saying;</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_40" data-id="MK14_40">and having returned, he found them again sleeping, for  their eyes were heavy, and they had not known what they might  answer him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_41" data-id="MK14_41">And he cometh the third time, and saith to them, `Sleep on  henceforth, and rest -- it is over; the hour did come; lo, the  Son of Man is delivered up to the hands of the sinful;</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_42" data-id="MK14_42">rise, we may go, lo, he who is delivering me up hath come  nigh.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_43" data-id="MK14_43">And immediately -- while he is yet speaking -- cometh near  Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude, with  swords and sticks, from the chief priests, and the scribes,  and the elders;</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_44" data-id="MK14_44">and he who is delivering him up had given a token to them,  saying, `Whomsoever I shall kiss, he it is, lay hold on him,  and lead him away safely,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_45" data-id="MK14_45">and having come, immediately, having gone near him, he  saith, `Rabbi, Rabbi,' and kissed him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_46" data-id="MK14_46">And they laid on him their hands, and kept hold on him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_47" data-id="MK14_47">and a certain one of those standing by, having drawn the  sword, struck the servant of the chief priest, and took off his  ear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_48" data-id="MK14_48">And Jesus answering said to them, `As against a robber ye  came out, with swords and sticks, to take me!</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_49" data-id="MK14_49">daily I was with you in the temple teaching, and ye did  not lay hold on me -- but that the Writings may be fulfilled.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_50" data-id="MK14_50">And having left him they all fled;</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_51" data-id="MK14_51">and a certain young man was following him, having put a  linen cloth about [his] naked body, and the young men lay hold  on him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_52" data-id="MK14_52">and he, having left the linen cloth, did flee from them  naked.</span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_53" data-id="MK14_53">And they led away Jesus unto the chief priest, and come  together to him do all the chief priests, and the elders, and  the scribes;</span>
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_54" data-id="MK14_54">and Peter afar off did follow him, to the inside of the  hall of the chief priest, and he was sitting with the officers,  and warming himself near the fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_55" data-id="MK14_55">And the chief priests and all the sanhedrim were seeking  against Jesus testimony -- to put him to death, and they were  not finding,</span>
<span class="v-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_56" data-id="MK14_56">for many were bearing false testimony against him, and  their testimonies were not alike.</span>
<span class="v-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_57" data-id="MK14_57">And certain having risen up, were bearing false testimony  against him, saying --</span>
<span class="v-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_58" data-id="MK14_58">`We heard him saying -- I will throw down this sanctuary  made with hands, and by three days, another made without hands  I will build;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-59">59&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_59" data-id="MK14_59">and neither so was their testimony alike.</span>
<span class="v-num v-60">60&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_60" data-id="MK14_60">And the chief priest, having risen up in the midst,  questioned Jesus, saying, `Thou dost not answer anything! what  do these testify against thee?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-61">61&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_61" data-id="MK14_61">and he was keeping silent, and did not answer anything.  Again the chief priest was questioning him, and saith to him,  `Art thou the Christ -- the Son of the Blessed?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-62">62&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_62" data-id="MK14_62">and Jesus said, `I am; and ye shall see the Son of Man  sitting on the right hand of the power, and coming with the  clouds, of the heaven.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-63">63&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_63" data-id="MK14_63">And the chief priest, having rent his garments, saith,  `What need have we yet of witnesses?</span>
<span class="v-num v-64">64&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_64" data-id="MK14_64">Ye heard the evil speaking, what appeareth to you?' and  they all condemned him to be worthy of death,</span>
<span class="v-num v-65">65&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_65" data-id="MK14_65">and certain began to spit on him, and to cover his face,  and to buffet him, and to say to him, `Prophesy;' and the  officers were striking him with their palms.</span>
<span class="v-num v-66">66&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_66" data-id="MK14_66">And Peter being in the hall beneath, there doth come one  of the maids of the chief priest,</span>
<span class="v-num v-67">67&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_67" data-id="MK14_67">and having seen Peter warming himself, having looked on  him, she said, `And thou wast with Jesus of Nazareth!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-68">68&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_68" data-id="MK14_68">and he denied, saying, `I have not known [him], neither do  I understand what thou sayest;' and he went forth without to  the porch, and a cock crew.</span>
<span class="v-num v-69">69&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_69" data-id="MK14_69">And the maid having seen him again, began to say to those  standing near -- `This is of them;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-70">70&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_70" data-id="MK14_70">and he was again denying. And after a little again, those  standing near said to Peter, `Truly thou art of them, for thou  also art a Galilean, and thy speech is alike;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-71">71&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_71" data-id="MK14_71">and he began to anathematize, and to swear -- `I have not  known this man of whom ye speak;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-72">72&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_72" data-id="MK14_72">and a second time a cock crew, and Peter remembered the  saying that Jesus said to him -- `Before a cock crow twice,  thou mayest deny me thrice;' and having thought thereon -- he  was weeping.</span>
