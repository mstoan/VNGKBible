<div class="c">15</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_1" data-id="MK15_1">And immediately, in the morning, the chief priests having  made a consultation, with the elders, and scribes, and the  whole sanhedrim, having bound Jesus, did lead away, and  delivered [him] to Pilate;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_2" data-id="MK15_2">and Pilate questioned him, `Art thou the king of the Jews?'  and he answering said to him, `Thou dost say [it].'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_3" data-id="MK15_3">And the chief priests were accusing him of many things,  [but he answered nothing.]</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_4" data-id="MK15_4">And Pilate again questioned him, saying, `Thou dost not  answer anything! lo, how many things they do testify against  thee!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_5" data-id="MK15_5">and Jesus did no more answer anything, so that Pilate  wondered.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_6" data-id="MK15_6">And at every feast he was releasing to them one prisoner,  whomsoever they were asking;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_7" data-id="MK15_7">and there was [one] named Barabbas, bound with those making  insurrection with him, who had in the insurrection committed  murder.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_8" data-id="MK15_8">And the multitude having cried out, began to ask for  themselves as he was always doing to them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_9" data-id="MK15_9">and Pilate answered them, saying, `Will ye [that] I shall  release to you the king of the Jews?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_10" data-id="MK15_10">for he knew that because of envy the chief priests had  delivered him up;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_11" data-id="MK15_11">and the chief priests did move the multitude, that he  might rather release Barabbas to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_12" data-id="MK15_12">And Pilate answering, again said to them, `What, then,  will ye [that] I shall do to him whom ye call king of the  Jews?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_13" data-id="MK15_13">and they again cried out, `Crucify him.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_14" data-id="MK15_14">And Pilate said to them, `Why -- what evil did he?' and  they cried out the more vehemently, `Crucify him;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_15" data-id="MK15_15">and Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released to  them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus -- having scourged [him]  -- that he might be crucified.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_16" data-id="MK15_16">And the soldiers led him away into the hall, which is  Praetorium, and call together the whole band,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_17" data-id="MK15_17">and clothe him with purple, and having plaited a crown of  thorns, they put [it] on him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_18" data-id="MK15_18">and began to salute him, `Hail, King of the Jews.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_19" data-id="MK15_19">And they were smiting him on the head with a reed, and  were spitting on him, and having bent the knee, were bowing to  him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_20" data-id="MK15_20">and when they [had] mocked him, they took the purple from  off him, and clothed him in his own garments, and they led him  forth, that they may crucify him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_21" data-id="MK15_21">And they impress a certain one passing by -- Simon, a  Cyrenian, coming from the field, the father of Alexander and  Rufus -- that he may bear his cross,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_22" data-id="MK15_22">and they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, being  interpreted, `Place of a skull;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_23" data-id="MK15_23">and they were giving him to drink wine mingled with myrrh,  and he did not receive.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_24" data-id="MK15_24">And having crucified him, they were dividing his garments,  casting a lot upon them, what each may take;</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_25" data-id="MK15_25">and it was the third hour, and they crucified him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_26" data-id="MK15_26">and the inscription of his accusation was written above --  `The King of the Jews.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_27" data-id="MK15_27">And with him they crucify two robbers, one on the right  hand, and one on his left,</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_28" data-id="MK15_28">and the Writing was fulfilled that is saying, `And with  lawless ones he was numbered.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_29" data-id="MK15_29">And those passing by were speaking evil of him, shaking  their heads, and saying, `Ah, the thrower down of the  sanctuary, and in three days the builder!</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_30" data-id="MK15_30">save thyself, and come down from the cross!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_31" data-id="MK15_31">And in like manner also the chief priests, mocking with  one another, with the scribes, said, `Others he saved; himself  he is not able to save.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_32" data-id="MK15_32">The Christ! the king of Israel -- let him come down now  from the cross, that we may see and believe;' and those  crucified with him were reproaching him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_33" data-id="MK15_33">And the sixth hour having come, darkness came over the  whole land till the ninth hour,</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_34" data-id="MK15_34">and at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a great voice,  saying, `Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabachthani?' which is, being  interpreted, `My God, my God, why didst Thou forsake me?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_35" data-id="MK15_35">And certain of those standing by, having heard, said, `Lo,  Elijah he doth call;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_36" data-id="MK15_36">and one having run, and having filled a spunge with  vinegar, having put [it] also on a reed, was giving him to  drink, saying, `Let alone, let us see if Elijah doth come to  take him down.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_37" data-id="MK15_37">And Jesus having uttered a loud cry, yielded the spirit,</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_38" data-id="MK15_38">and the veil of the sanctuary was rent in two, from top to  bottom,</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_39" data-id="MK15_39">and the centurion who was standing over-against him,  having seen that, having so cried out, he yielded the spirit,  said, `Truly this man was Son of God.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_40" data-id="MK15_40">And there were also women afar off beholding, among whom  was also Mary the Magdalene, and Mary of James the less, and  of Joses, and Salome,</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_41" data-id="MK15_41">(who also, when he was in Galilee, were following him, and  were ministering to him,) and many other women who came up with  him to Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_42" data-id="MK15_42">And now evening having come, seeing it was the  preparation, that is, the fore-sabbath,</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_43" data-id="MK15_43">Joseph of Arimathea, an honourable counsellor, who also  himself was waiting for the reign of God, came, boldly entered  in unto Pilate, and asked the body of Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_44" data-id="MK15_44">And Pilate wondered if he were already dead, and having  called near the centurion, did question him if he were long  dead,</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_45" data-id="MK15_45">and having known [it] from the centurion, he granted the  body to Joseph.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_46" data-id="MK15_46">And he, having brought fine linen, and having taken him  down, wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre  that had been hewn out of a rock, and he rolled a stone unto  the door of the sepulchre,</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_47" data-id="MK15_47">and Mary the Magdalene, and Mary of Joses, were beholding  where he is laid.</span>
