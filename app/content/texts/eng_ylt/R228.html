<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_19" data-id="R228_19">for Jehovah hath humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of  Israel, for he made free with Judah, even to commit a trespass  against Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_20" data-id="R228_20">And Tilgath-Pilneser king of Asshur cometh in unto him,  and doth distress him, and hath not strengthened him,</span>

<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_24" data-id="R228_24">And Ahaz gathereth the vessels of the house of God, and  cutteth in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shutteth  the doors of the house of Jehovah, and maketh to himself altars  in every corner in Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_25" data-id="R228_25">And in every city and city of Judah he hath made high  places to make perfume to other gods, and provoketh Jehovah,  God of his fathers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_26" data-id="R228_26">And the rest of his matters, and all his ways, the first  and the last, lo, they are written on the book of the kings of  Judah and Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v R228_27" data-id="R228_27">And Ahaz lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in the  city, in Jerusalem, but have not brought him in to the graves  of the kings of Israel, and reign doth Hezekiah his son in his  stead.</span>
