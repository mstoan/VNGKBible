<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_2" data-id="LK19_2">and lo, a man, by name called Zaccheus, and he was a chief  tax-gatherer, and he was rich,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_3" data-id="LK19_3">and he was seeking to see Jesus, who he is, and was not  able for the multitude, because in stature he was small,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_4" data-id="LK19_4">and having run forward before, he went up on a sycamore,  that he may see him, because through that [way] he was about to  pass by.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_5" data-id="LK19_5">And as Jesus came up to the place, having looked up, he saw  him, and said unto him, `Zaccheus, having hastened, come down,  for to-day in thy house it behoveth me to remain;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_6" data-id="LK19_6">and he having hastened did come down, and did receive him  rejoicing;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_7" data-id="LK19_7">and having seen [it], they were all murmuring, saying --  `With a sinful man he went in to lodge!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_8" data-id="LK19_8">And Zaccheus having stood, said unto the Lord, `Lo, the  half of my goods, sir, I give to the poor, and if of any one  anything I did take by false accusation, I give back  fourfold.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_9" data-id="LK19_9">And Jesus said unto him -- `To-day salvation did come to  this house, inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_10" data-id="LK19_10">for the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_11" data-id="LK19_11">And while they are hearing these things, having added he  spake a simile, because of his being nigh to Jerusalem, and of  their thinking that the reign of God is about presently to be  made manifest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_12" data-id="LK19_12">He said therefore, `A certain man of birth went on to a  far country, to take to himself a kingdom, and to return,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_13" data-id="LK19_13">and having called ten servants of his own, he gave to them  ten pounds, and said unto them, Do business -- till I come;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_14" data-id="LK19_14">and his citizens were hating him, and did send an embassy  after him, saying, We do not wish this one to reign over us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_15" data-id="LK19_15">`And it came to pass, on his coming back, having taken the  kingdom, that he commanded these servants to be called to him,  to whom he gave the money, that he might know what any one had  done in business.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_16" data-id="LK19_16">`And the first came near, saying, Sir, thy pound did gain  ten pounds;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_17" data-id="LK19_17">and he said to him, Well done, good servant, because in a  very little thou didst become faithful, be having authority  over ten cities.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_18" data-id="LK19_18">`And the second came, saying, Sir, thy pound made five  pounds;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_19" data-id="LK19_19">and he said also to this one, And thou, become thou over  five cities.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_20" data-id="LK19_20">`And another came, saying, Sir, lo, thy pound, that I had  lying away in a napkin;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_21" data-id="LK19_21">for I was afraid of thee, because thou art an austere man;  thou takest up what thou didst not lay down, and reapest what  thou didst not sow.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_22" data-id="LK19_22">`And he saith to him, Out of thy mouth I will judge thee,  evil servant: thou knewest that I am an austere man, taking up  what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow!</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_23" data-id="LK19_23">and wherefore didst thou not give my money to the bank,  and I, having come, with interest might have received it?</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_24" data-id="LK19_24">`And to those standing by he said, Take from him the  pound, and give to him having the ten pounds --</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_25" data-id="LK19_25">(and they said to him, Sir, he hath ten pounds) --</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_26" data-id="LK19_26">for I say to you, that to every one having shall be given,  and from him not having, also what he hath shall be taken from  him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_27" data-id="LK19_27">but those my enemies, who did not wish me to reign over  them, bring hither and slay before me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_28" data-id="LK19_28">And having said these things, he went on before, going up  to Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_29" data-id="LK19_29">And it came to pass, as he came nigh to Bethphage and  Bethany, unto the mount called of the Olives, he sent two of  his disciples,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_30" data-id="LK19_30">having said, Go away to the village over-against, in  which, entering into, ye shall find a colt bound, on which no  one of men did ever sit, having loosed it, bring [it];</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_31" data-id="LK19_31">and if any one doth question you, Wherefore do ye loose  [it]? thus ye shall say to him -- The Lord hath need of it.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_32" data-id="LK19_32">And those sent, having gone away, found according as he  said to them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_33" data-id="LK19_33">and while they are loosing the colt, its owners said unto  them, `Why loose ye the colt?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_34" data-id="LK19_34">and they said, `The Lord hath need of it;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_35" data-id="LK19_35">and they brought it unto Jesus, and having cast their  garments upon the colt, they did set Jesus upon it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_36" data-id="LK19_36">And as he is going, they were spreading their garments in  the way,</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_37" data-id="LK19_37">and as he is coming nigh now, at the descent of the mount  of the Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began  rejoicing to praise God with a great voice for all the mighty  works they had seen,</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_38" data-id="LK19_38">saying, `blessed [is] he who is coming, a king in the name  of the Lord; peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_39" data-id="LK19_39">And certain of the Pharisees from the multitude said unto  him, `Teacher, rebuke thy disciples;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_40" data-id="LK19_40">and he answering said to them, `I say to you, that, if  these shall be silent, the stones will cry out!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_41" data-id="LK19_41">And when he came nigh, having seen the city, he wept over  it,</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_42" data-id="LK19_42">saying -- `If thou didst know, even thou, at least in this  thy day, the things for thy peace; but now they were hid from  thine eyes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_43" data-id="LK19_43">`Because days shall come upon thee, and thine enemies  shall cast around thee a rampart, and compass thee round, and  press thee on every side,</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_44" data-id="LK19_44">and lay thee low, and thy children within thee, and they  shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone, because thou  didst not know the time of thy inspection.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_45" data-id="LK19_45">And having entered into the temple, he began to cast forth  those selling in it, and those buying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_46" data-id="LK19_46">saying to them, `It hath been written, My house is a house  of prayer -- but ye made it a den of robbers.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_47" data-id="LK19_47">And he was teaching daily in the temple, but the chief  priests and the scribes were seeking to destroy him -- also  the chiefs of the people --</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK19_48" data-id="LK19_48">and they were not finding what they shall do, for all the  people were hanging on him, hearing him.</span>
