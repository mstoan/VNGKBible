<div class="c">2</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_1" data-id="JN2_1">And the third day a marriage happened in Cana of Galilee,  and the mother of Jesus was there,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_2" data-id="JN2_2">and also Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the  marriage;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_3" data-id="JN2_3">and wine having failed, the mother of Jesus saith unto him,  `Wine they have not;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_4" data-id="JN2_4">Jesus saith to her, `What -- to me and to thee, woman? not  yet is mine hour come.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_5" data-id="JN2_5">His mother saith to the ministrants, `Whatever he may say to  you -- do.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_6" data-id="JN2_6">And there were there six water-jugs of stone, placed  according to the purifying of the Jews, holding each two or  three measures.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_7" data-id="JN2_7">Jesus saith to them, `Fill the water-jugs with water;' and  they filled them -- unto the brim;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_8" data-id="JN2_8">and he saith to them, `Draw out, now, and bear to the  director of the apartment;' and they bare.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_9" data-id="JN2_9">And as the director of the apartment tasted the water become  wine, and knew not whence it is, (but the ministrants knew, who  have drawn the water,) the director of the feast doth call the  bridegroom,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_10" data-id="JN2_10">and saith to him, `Every man, at first, the good wine doth  set forth; and when they may have drunk freely, then the  inferior; thou didst keep the good wine till now.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_11" data-id="JN2_11">This beginning of the signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee,  and manifested his glory, and his disciples believed in him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_12" data-id="JN2_12">after this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother,  and his brethren, and his disciples; and there they remained  not many days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_13" data-id="JN2_13">And the passover of the Jews was nigh, and Jesus went up to  Jerusalem,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_14" data-id="JN2_14">and he found in the temple those selling oxen, and sheep,  and doves, and the money-changers sitting,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_15" data-id="JN2_15">and having made a whip of small cords, he put all forth out  of the temple, also the sheep, and the oxen; and of the  money-changers he poured out the coins, and the tables he  overthrew,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_16" data-id="JN2_16">and to those selling the doves he said, `Take these things  hence; make not the house of my Father a house of  merchandise.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_17" data-id="JN2_17">And his disciples remembered that it is written, `The zeal  of Thy house did eat me up;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_18" data-id="JN2_18">the Jews then answered and said to him, `What sign dost  thou shew to us -- that thou dost these things?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_19" data-id="JN2_19">Jesus answered and said to them, `Destroy this sanctuary,  and in three days I will raise it up.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_20" data-id="JN2_20">The Jews, therefore, said, `Forty and six years was this  sanctuary building, and wilt thou in three days raise it up?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_21" data-id="JN2_21">but he spake concerning the sanctuary of his body;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_22" data-id="JN2_22">when, then, he was raised out of the dead, his disciples  remembered that he said this to them, and they believed the  Writing, and the word that Jesus said.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_23" data-id="JN2_23">And as he was in Jerusalem, in the passover, in the feast,  many believed in his name, beholding his signs that he was  doing;</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_24" data-id="JN2_24">and Jesus himself was not trusting himself to them, because  of his knowing all [men],</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN2_25" data-id="JN2_25">and because he had no need that any should testify  concerning man, for he himself was knowing what was in man.</span>
