<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS40_2" data-id="PS40_2">And He doth cause me to come up From a pit of desolation --  from mire of mud, And He raiseth up on a rock my feet, He is  establishing my steps.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS40_3" data-id="PS40_3">And He putteth in my mouth a new song, `Praise to our God.'  Many do see and fear, and trust in Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS40_4" data-id="PS40_4">O the happiness of the man Who hath made Jehovah his trust,  And hath not turned unto the proud, And those turning aside to  lies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS40_5" data-id="PS40_5">Much hast Thou done, Jehovah my God; Thy wonders and Thy  thoughts toward us, There is none to arrange unto Thee, I  declare and speak: They have been more than to be numbered.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS40_6" data-id="PS40_6">Sacrifice and present Thou hast not desired, Ears Thou hast  prepared for me, Burnt and sin-offering Thou hast not asked.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PS40_7" data-id="PS40_7">Then said I, `Lo, I have come,' In the roll of the book it  is written of me,</span>
