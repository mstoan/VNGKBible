<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_2" data-id="LK8_2">and certain women, who were healed of evil spirits and  infirmities, Mary who is called Magdalene, from whom seven  demons had gone forth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_3" data-id="LK8_3">and Joanna wife of Chuza, steward of Herod, and Susanna, and  many others, who were ministering to him from their substance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_4" data-id="LK8_4">And a great multitude having gathered, and those who from  city and city were coming unto him, he spake by a simile:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_5" data-id="LK8_5">`The sower went forth to sow his seed, and in his sowing  some indeed fell beside the way, and it was trodden down, and  the fowls of the heaven did devour it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_6" data-id="LK8_6">`And other fell upon the rock, and having sprung up, it did  wither, through not having moisture.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_7" data-id="LK8_7">`And other fell amidst the thorns, and the thorns having  sprung up with it, did choke it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_8" data-id="LK8_8">`And other fell upon the good ground, and having sprung up,  it made fruit an hundred fold.' These things saying, he was  calling, `He having ears to hear -- let him hear.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_9" data-id="LK8_9">And his disciples were questioning him, saying, `What may  this simile be?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_10" data-id="LK8_10">And he said, `To you it hath been given to know the secrets  of the reign of God, and to the rest in similes; that seeing  they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_11" data-id="LK8_11">`And this is the simile: The seed is the word of God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_12" data-id="LK8_12">and those beside the way are those hearing, then cometh the  Devil, and taketh up the word from their heart, lest having  believed, they may be saved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_13" data-id="LK8_13">`And those upon the rock: They who, when they may hear,  with joy do receive the word, and these have no root, who for a  time believe, and in time of temptation fall away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_14" data-id="LK8_14">`And that which fell to the thorns: These are they who have  heard, and going forth, through anxieties, and riches, and  pleasures of life, are choked, and bear not to completion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_15" data-id="LK8_15">`And that in the good ground: These are they, who in an  upright and good heart, having heard the word, do retain [it],  and bear fruit in continuance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_16" data-id="LK8_16">`And no one having lighted a lamp doth cover it with a  vessel, or under a couch doth put [it]; but upon a lamp-stand  he doth put [it], that those coming in may see the light,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_17" data-id="LK8_17">for nothing is secret, that shall not become manifest, nor  hid, that shall not be known, and become manifest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_18" data-id="LK8_18">`See, therefore, how ye hear, for whoever may have, there  shall be given to him, and whoever may not have, also what he  seemeth to have, shall be taken from him.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_19" data-id="LK8_19">And there came unto him his mother and brethren, and they  were not able to get to him because of the multitude,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_20" data-id="LK8_20">and it was told him, saying, `Thy mother and thy brethren  do stand without, wishing to see thee;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_21" data-id="LK8_21">and he answering said unto them, `My mother and my  brethren! they are those who the word of God are hearing, and  doing.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_22" data-id="LK8_22">And it came to pass, on one of the days, that he himself  went into a boat with his disciples, and he said unto them,  `We may go over to the other side of the lake;' and they set  forth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_23" data-id="LK8_23">and as they are sailing he fell deeply asleep, and there  came down a storm of wind to the lake, and they were filling,  and were in peril.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_24" data-id="LK8_24">And having come near, they awoke him, saying, `Master,  master, we perish;' and he, having arisen, rebuked the wind  and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and there came a  calm,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_25" data-id="LK8_25">and he said to them, `Where is your faith?' and they being  afraid did wonder, saying unto one another, `Who, then, is  this, that even the winds he doth command, and the water, and  they obey him?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_26" data-id="LK8_26">And they sailed down to the region of the Gadarenes, that  is over-against Galilee,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_27" data-id="LK8_27">and he having gone forth upon the land, there met him a  certain man, out of the city, who had demons for a long time,  and with a garment was not clothed, and in a house was not  abiding, but in the tombs,</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_28" data-id="LK8_28">and having seen Jesus, and having cried out, he fell before  him, and with a loud voice, said, `What -- to me and to thee,  Jesus, Son of God Most High? I beseech thee, mayest thou not  afflict me!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_29" data-id="LK8_29">For he commanded the unclean spirit to come forth from the  man, for many times it had caught him, and he was being bound  with chains and fetters -- guarded, and breaking asunder the  bonds he was driven by the demons to the deserts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_30" data-id="LK8_30">And Jesus questioned him, saying, `What is thy name?' and  he said, `Legion,' (because many demons were entered into him,)</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_31" data-id="LK8_31">and he was calling on him, that he may not command them to  go away to the abyss,</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_32" data-id="LK8_32">and there was there a herd of many swine feeding in the  mountain, and they were calling on him, that he might suffer  them to enter into these, and he suffered them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_33" data-id="LK8_33">and the demons having gone forth from the man, did enter  into the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep to the lake,  and were choked.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_34" data-id="LK8_34">And those feeding [them], having seen what was come to  pass, fled, and having gone, told [it] to the city, and to the  fields;</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_35" data-id="LK8_35">and they came forth to see what was come to pass, and they  came unto Jesus, and found the man sitting, out of whom the  demons had gone forth, clothed, and right-minded, at the feet  of Jesus, and they were afraid;</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_36" data-id="LK8_36">and those also having seen [it], told them how the demoniac  was saved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_37" data-id="LK8_37">And the whole multitude of the region of the Gadarenes  round about asked him to go away from them, because with great  fear they were pressed, and he having entered into the boat,  did turn back.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_38" data-id="LK8_38">And the man from whom the demons had gone forth was  beseeching of him to be with him, and Jesus sent him away,  saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_39" data-id="LK8_39">`Turn back to thy house, and tell how great things God did  to thee;' and he went away through all the city proclaiming  how great things Jesus did to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_40" data-id="LK8_40">And it came to pass, in the turning back of Jesus, the  multitude received him, for they were all looking for him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_41" data-id="LK8_41">and lo, there came a man, whose name [is] Jairus, and he  was a chief of the synagogue, and having fallen at the feet of  Jesus, was calling on him to come to his house;</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_42" data-id="LK8_42">because he had an only daughter about twelve years [old],  and she was dying. And in his going away, the multitudes were  thronging him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_43" data-id="LK8_43">and a woman, having an issue of blood for twelve years,  who, having spent on physicians all her living, was not able to  be healed by any,</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_44" data-id="LK8_44">having come near behind, touched the fringe of his garment,  and presently the issue of her blood stood.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_45" data-id="LK8_45">And Jesus said, `Who [is] it that touched me?' and all  denying, Peter and those with him said, `Master, the multitudes  press thee, and throng [thee], and thou dost say, Who [is] it  that touched me!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_46" data-id="LK8_46">And Jesus said, `Some one did touch me, for I knew power  having gone forth from me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_47" data-id="LK8_47">And the woman, having seen that she was not hid, trembling,  came, and having fallen before him, for what cause she touched  him declared to him before all the people, and how she was  healed presently;</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_48" data-id="LK8_48">and he said to her, `Take courage, daughter, thy faith hath  saved thee, be going on to peace.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_49" data-id="LK8_49">While he is yet speaking, there doth come a certain one  from the chief of the synagogue's [house], saying to him --  `Thy daughter hath died, harass not the Teacher;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_50" data-id="LK8_50">and Jesus having heard, answered him, saying, `Be not  afraid, only believe, and she shall be saved.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_51" data-id="LK8_51">And having come to the house, he suffered no one to go in,  except Peter, and James, and John, and the father of the child,  and the mother;</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_52" data-id="LK8_52">and they were all weeping, and beating themselves for her,  and he said, `Weep not, she did not die, but doth sleep;</span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_53" data-id="LK8_53">and they were deriding him, knowing that she did die;</span>
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_54" data-id="LK8_54">and he having put all forth without, and having taken hold  of her hand, called, saying, `Child, arise;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_55" data-id="LK8_55">and her spirit came back, and she arose presently, and he  directed that there be given to her to eat;</span>
<span class="v-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK8_56" data-id="LK8_56">and her parents were amazed, but he charged them to say to  no one what was come to pass.</span>
