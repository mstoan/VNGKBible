<div class="c">3</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_1" data-id="P13_1">In like manner, the wives, be ye subject to your own  husbands, that even if certain are disobedient to the word,  through the conversation of the wives, without the word, they  may be won,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_2" data-id="P13_2">having beheld your pure behaviour in fear,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_3" data-id="P13_3">whose adorning -- let it not be that which is outward, of  plaiting of hair, and of putting around of things of gold, or  of putting on of garments,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_4" data-id="P13_4">but -- the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible  thing of the meek and quiet spirit, which is, before God, of  great price,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_5" data-id="P13_5">for thus once also the holy women who did hope on God, were  adorning themselves, being subject to their own husbands,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_6" data-id="P13_6">as Sarah was obedient to Abraham, calling him `sir,' of whom  ye did become daughters, doing good, and not fearing any  terror.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_7" data-id="P13_7">The husbands, in like manner, dwelling with [them],  according to knowledge, as to a weaker vessel -- to the wife  -- imparting honour, as also being heirs together of the grace  of life, that your prayers be not hindered.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_8" data-id="P13_8">And finally, being all of one mind, having fellow-feeling,  loving as brethren, compassionate, courteous,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_9" data-id="P13_9">not giving back evil for evil, or railing for railing, and  on the contrary, blessing, having known that to this ye were  called, that a blessing ye may inherit;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_10" data-id="P13_10">for `he who is willing to love life, and to see good days,  let him guard his tongue from evil, and his lips -- not to  speak guile;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_11" data-id="P13_11">let him turn aside from evil, and do good, let him seek  peace and pursue it;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_12" data-id="P13_12">because the eyes of the Lord [are] upon the righteous, and  His ears -- to their supplication, and the face of the Lord  [is] upon those doing evil;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_13" data-id="P13_13">and who [is] he who will be doing you evil, if of Him who  is good ye may become imitators?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_14" data-id="P13_14">but if ye also should suffer because of righteousness,  happy [are ye]! and of their fear be not afraid, nor be  troubled,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_15" data-id="P13_15">and the Lord God sanctify in your hearts. And [be] ready  always for defence to every one who is asking of you an account  concerning the hope that [is] in you, with meekness and fear;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_16" data-id="P13_16">having a good conscience, that in that in which they speak  against you as evil-doers, they may be ashamed who are  traducing your good behaviour in Christ;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_17" data-id="P13_17">for [it is] better doing good, if the will of God will it,  to suffer, than doing evil;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_18" data-id="P13_18">because also Christ once for sin did suffer -- righteous  for unrighteous -- that he might lead us to God, having been  put to death indeed, in the flesh, and having been made alive  in the spirit,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_19" data-id="P13_19">in which also to the spirits in prison having gone he did  preach,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_20" data-id="P13_20">who sometime disbelieved, when once the long-suffering of  God did wait, in days of Noah -- an ark being preparing -- in  which few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_21" data-id="P13_21">also to which an antitype doth now save us -- baptism, (not  a putting away of the filth of flesh, but the question of a  good conscience in regard to God,) through the rising again of  Jesus Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_22" data-id="P13_22">who is at the right hand of God, having gone on to heaven  -- messengers, and authorities, and powers, having been  subjected to him.</span>
