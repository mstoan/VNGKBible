<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC5_2" data-id="MC5_2">And thou, Beth-Lehem Ephratah, Little to be among the chiefs  of Judah! From thee to Me he cometh forth -- to be ruler in  Israel, And his comings forth [are] of old, From the days of  antiquity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC5_3" data-id="MC5_3">Therefore he doth give them out till the time She who  bringeth forth hath brought forth, And the remnant of his  brethren return to the sons of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC5_4" data-id="MC5_4">And he hath stood and delighted in the strength of Jehovah,  In the excellency of the name of Jehovah his God, And they have  remained, For now he is great unto the ends of earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC5_5" data-id="MC5_5">And this [one] hath been peace, Asshur! when he doth come  into our land, And when he doth tread in our palaces, We have  raised against him seven shepherds, And eight anointed of man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC5_6" data-id="MC5_6">And they have afflicted the land of Asshur with the sword,  And the land of Nimrod at its openings, And he hath delivered  from Asshur when he doth come into our land, And when he  treadeth in our borders.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC5_7" data-id="MC5_7">And the remnant of Jacob hath been in the midst of many  peoples, As dew from Jehovah -- as showers on the herb, That  waiteth not for man, nor stayeth for the sons of men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC5_8" data-id="MC5_8">Yea, the remnant of Jacob hath been among nations, In the  midst of many peoples, As a lion among beasts of a forest, As a  young lion among ranks of a flock, Which if it hath passed  through, Hath both trodden down and hath torn, And there is no  deliverer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC5_9" data-id="MC5_9">High is thy hand above thine adversaries, And all thine  enemies are cut off.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC5_10" data-id="MC5_10">And it hath come to pass in that day, An affirmation of  Jehovah, I have cut off thy horses from thy midst, And I have  destroyed thy chariots,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC5_11" data-id="MC5_11">And I have cut off the cities of thy land, And I have  thrown down all thy fortresses,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC5_12" data-id="MC5_12">And have cut off sorcerers out of thy hand, And observers  of clouds thou hast none.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC5_13" data-id="MC5_13">And I have cut off thy graven images, And thy  standing-pillars out of thy midst, And thou dost not bow  thyself any more To the work of thy hands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC5_14" data-id="MC5_14">And I have plucked up thy shrines out of thy midst, And I  have destroyed thine enemies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC5_15" data-id="MC5_15">And I have done vengeance in anger and in fury, With the  nations who have not hearkened!</span>
