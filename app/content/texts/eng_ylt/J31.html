<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_2" data-id="J31_2">beloved, concerning all things I desire thee to prosper, and  to be in health, even as thy soul doth prosper,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_3" data-id="J31_3">for I rejoiced exceedingly, brethren coming and testifying  of the truth in thee, even as thou in truth dost walk;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_4" data-id="J31_4">greater than these things I have no joy, that I may hear of  my children in truth walking.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_5" data-id="J31_5">Beloved, faithfully dost thou do whatever thou mayest work  to the brethren and to the strangers,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_6" data-id="J31_6">who did testify of thy love before an assembly, whom thou  wilt do well, having sent forward worthily of God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_7" data-id="J31_7">because for [His] name they went forth, nothing receiving  from the nations;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_8" data-id="J31_8">we, then, ought to receive such, that fellow-workers we may  become to the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_9" data-id="J31_9">I did write to the assembly, but he who is loving the first  place among them -- Diotrephes -- doth not receive us;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_10" data-id="J31_10">because of this, if I may come, I will cause him to  remember his works that he doth, with evil words prating  against us; and not content with these, neither doth he  himself receive the brethren, and those intending he doth   forbid, and out of the assembly he doth cast.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_11" data-id="J31_11">Beloved, be not thou following that which is evil, but that  which is good; he who is doing good, of God he is, and he who  is doing evil hath not seen God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_12" data-id="J31_12">to Demetrius testimony hath been given by all, and by the  truth itself, and we also -- we do testify, and ye have known  that our testimony is true.</span>
