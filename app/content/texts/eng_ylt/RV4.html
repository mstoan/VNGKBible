<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV4_2" data-id="RV4_2">and immediately I was in the Spirit, and lo, a throne was  set in the heaven, and upon the throne is [one] sitting,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV4_3" data-id="RV4_3">and He who is sitting was in sight like a stone, jasper and  sardine: and a rainbow was round the throne in sight like an  emerald.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV4_4" data-id="RV4_4">And around the throne [are] thrones twenty and four, and  upon the thrones I saw the twenty and four elders sitting,  clothed in white garments, and they had upon their heads crowns  of gold;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV4_5" data-id="RV4_5">and out of the throne proceed do lightnings, and thunders,  and voices; and seven lamps of fire are burning before the  throne, which are the Seven Spirits of God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV4_6" data-id="RV4_6">and before the throne [is] a sea of glass like to crystal,  and in the midst of the throne, and round the throne, [are]  four living creatures, full of eyes before and behind;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV4_7" data-id="RV4_7">and the first living creature [is] like a lion, and the  second living creature [is] like a calf, and the third living  creature hath the face as a man, and the fourth living creature  [is] like an eagle flying.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV4_8" data-id="RV4_8">And the four living creatures, each by itself severally, had  six wings, around and within [are] full of eyes, and rest they  have not day and night, saying, `Holy, holy, holy, Lord God  Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is coming;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV4_9" data-id="RV4_9">and when the living creatures do give glory, and honour, and  thanks, to Him who is sitting upon the throne, who is living to  the ages of the ages,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV4_10" data-id="RV4_10">fall down do the twenty and four elders before Him who is  sitting upon the throne, and bow before Him who is living to  the ages of the ages, and they cast their crowns before the  throne, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV4_11" data-id="RV4_11">`Worthy art Thou, O Lord, to receive the glory, and the  honour, and the power, because Thou -- Thou didst create the  all things, and because of Thy will are they, and they were  created.'</span>
