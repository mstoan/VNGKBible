<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_2" data-id="C213_2">I have said before, and I say [it] before, as being  present, the second time, and being absent, now, do I write to  those having sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come  again, I will not spare,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_3" data-id="C213_3">since a proof ye seek of the Christ speaking in me, who to  you is not infirm, but is powerful in you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_4" data-id="C213_4">for even if he was crucified from infirmity, yet he doth  live from the power of God; for we also are weak in him, but we  shall live with him from the power of God toward you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_5" data-id="C213_5">Your ownselves try ye, if ye are in the faith; your  ownselves prove ye; do ye not know your ownselves, that Jesus  Christ is in you, if ye be not in some respect disapproved of?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_6" data-id="C213_6">and I hope that ye shall know that we -- we are not  disapproved of;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_7" data-id="C213_7">and I pray before God that ye do no evil, not that we may  appear approved, but that ye may do that which is right, and we  may be as disapproved;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_8" data-id="C213_8">for we are not able to do anything against the truth, but  for the truth;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_9" data-id="C213_9">for we rejoice when we may be infirm, and ye may be  powerful; and this also we pray for -- your perfection!</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_10" data-id="C213_10">because of this, these things -- being absent -- I write,  that being present, I may not treat [any] sharply, according to  the authority that the Lord did give me for building up, and  not for casting down.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C213_11" data-id="C213_11">Henceforth, brethren, rejoice; be made perfect, be  comforted, be of the same mind, be at peace, and the God of the  love and peace shall be with you;</span>
