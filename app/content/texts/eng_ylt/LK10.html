<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK10_2" data-id="LK10_2">then said he unto them, `The harvest indeed [is] abundant,  but the workmen few; beseech ye then the Lord of the harvest,  that He may put forth workmen to His harvest.</span>

<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK10_23" data-id="LK10_23">And having turned unto the disciples, he said, by  themselves, `Happy the eyes that are perceiving what ye  perceive;</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK10_24" data-id="LK10_24">for I say to you, that many prophets and kings did wish to  see what ye perceive, and did not see, and to hear what ye  hear, and did not hear.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK10_25" data-id="LK10_25">And lo, a certain lawyer stood up, trying him, and saying,  `Teacher, what having done, life age-during shall I inherit?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK10_26" data-id="LK10_26">And he said unto him, `In the law what hath been written?  how dost thou read?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK10_27" data-id="LK10_27">And he answering said, `Thou shalt love the Lord thy God  out of all thy heart, and out of all thy soul, and out of all  thy strength, and out of all thy understanding, and thy  neighbour as thyself.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK10_28" data-id="LK10_28">And he said to him, `Rightly thou didst answer; this do,  and thou shalt live.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK10_29" data-id="LK10_29">And he, willing to declare himself righteous, said unto  Jesus, `And who is my neighbour?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK10_30" data-id="LK10_30">and Jesus having taken up [the word], said, `A certain man  was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among  robbers, and having stripped him and inflicted blows, they went  away, leaving [him] half dead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK10_31" data-id="LK10_31">`And by a coincidence a certain priest was going down in  that way, and having seen him, he passed over on the opposite  side;</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK10_32" data-id="LK10_32">and in like manner also, a Levite, having been about the  place, having come and seen, passed over on the opposite side.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK10_33" data-id="LK10_33">`But a certain Samaritan, journeying, came along him, and  having seen him, he was moved with compassion,</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK10_34" data-id="LK10_34">and having come near, he bound up his wounds, pouring on  oil and wine, and having lifted him up on his own beast, he  brought him to an inn, and was careful of him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK10_35" data-id="LK10_35">and on the morrow, going forth, taking out two denaries,  he gave to the innkeeper, and said to him, Be careful of him,  and whatever thou mayest spend more, I, in my coming again,  will give back to thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK10_36" data-id="LK10_36">`Who, then, of these three, seemeth to thee to have become  neighbour of him who fell among the robbers?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK10_37" data-id="LK10_37">and he said, `He who did the kindness with him,' then  Jesus said to him, `Be going on, and thou be doing in like  manner.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK10_38" data-id="LK10_38">And it came to pass, in their going on, that he entered  into a certain village, and a certain woman, by name Martha,  did receive him into her house,</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK10_39" data-id="LK10_39">and she had also a sister, called Mary, who also, having  seated herself beside the feet of Jesus, was hearing the word,</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK10_40" data-id="LK10_40">and Martha was distracted about much serving, and having  stood by him, she said, `Sir, dost thou not care that my sister  left me alone to serve? say then to her, that she may partake  along with me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK10_41" data-id="LK10_41">And Jesus answering said to her, `Martha, Martha, thou art  anxious and disquieted about many things,</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK10_42" data-id="LK10_42">but of one thing there is need, and Mary the good part did  choose, that shall not be taken away from her.'</span>
