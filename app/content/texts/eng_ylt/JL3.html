<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL3_2" data-id="JL3_2">Then I have gathered all the nations, And caused them to go  down unto the valley of Jehoshaphat, And I have been judged  with them there, Concerning My people and Mine inheritance --  Israel, Whom they scattered among nations, And My land they  have apportioned.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL3_3" data-id="JL3_3">And for My people they do cast a lot, And they give the  young man for an harlot, And the young woman have sold for  wine, That they may drink.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL3_4" data-id="JL3_4">And also, what [are] ye to Me, O Tyre and Zidon, And all  circuits of Philistia? Recompence are ye rendering unto Me? And  if ye are giving recompence to Me, Swiftly, hastily, I turn  back your recompence on your head.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL3_5" data-id="JL3_5">In that My silver and My gold ye took, And My desirable  things that are good, Ye have brought in to your temples.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL3_6" data-id="JL3_6">And sons of Judah, and sons of Jerusalem, Ye have sold to  the sons of Javan, To put them far off from their border.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL3_7" data-id="JL3_7">Lo, I am stirring them up out of the place Whither ye have  sold them, And I have turned back your recompence on your head,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL3_8" data-id="JL3_8">And have sold your sons and your daughters Into the hand of  the sons of Judah, And they have sold them to Shabeans, Unto a  nation far off, for Jehovah hath spoken.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL3_9" data-id="JL3_9">Proclaim ye this among nations, Sanctify a war, stir up the  mighty ones, Come nigh, come up, let all the men of war.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL3_10" data-id="JL3_10">Beat your ploughshares to swords, And your pruning-hooks to  javelins, Let the weak say, `I [am] mighty.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL3_14" data-id="JL3_14">Multitudes, multitudes [are] in the valley of decision, For  near [is] the day of Jehovah in the valley of decision.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL3_15" data-id="JL3_15">Sun and moon have been black, And stars have gathered up  their shining.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL3_16" data-id="JL3_16">And Jehovah from Zion doth roar, And from Jerusalem giveth  forth His voice, And shaken have the heavens and earth, And  Jehovah [is] a refuge to his people, And a stronghold to sons  of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL3_17" data-id="JL3_17">And ye have known that I [am] Jehovah your God, Dwelling in  Zion, My holy mountain, And Jerusalem hath been holy, And  strangers do not pass over into it again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL3_18" data-id="JL3_18">And it hath come to pass, in that day, Drop down do the  mountains juice, And the hills do flow [with] milk, And all  streams of Judah do go [with] water, And a fountain from the  house of Jehovah goeth forth, And hath watered the valley of  Shittim.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL3_19" data-id="JL3_19">Egypt a desolation becometh, And Edom a desolation, a  wilderness, becometh, For violence [to] sons of Judah, Whose  innocent blood they shed in their land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL3_20" data-id="JL3_20">And Judah to the age doth dwell, And Jerusalem to  generation and generation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL3_21" data-id="JL3_21">And I have declared their blood innocent, [That] I did not  declare innocent, And Jehovah is dwelling in Zion!</span>
