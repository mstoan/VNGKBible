<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS56_2" data-id="IS56_2">O the happiness of a man who doth this, And of a son of man  who keepeth hold on it, Keeping the sabbath from polluting it,  And keeping his hand from doing any evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS56_3" data-id="IS56_3">Nor speak let a son of the stranger, Who is joined unto  Jehovah, saying: `Jehovah doth certainly separate me from His  people.' Nor say let the eunuch, `Lo, I am a tree dried up,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS56_4" data-id="IS56_4">For thus said Jehovah of the eunuchs, Who do keep My  sabbaths, And have fixed on that which I desired, And are  keeping hold on My covenant:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS56_5" data-id="IS56_5">I have given to them in My house, And within My walls a  station and a name, Better than sons and than daughters, A name  age-during I give to him That is not cut off.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS56_6" data-id="IS56_6">And sons of the stranger, who are joined to Jehovah, To  serve Him, and to love the name of Jehovah, To be to Him for  servants, Every keeper of the sabbath from polluting it, And  those keeping hold on My covenant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS56_7" data-id="IS56_7">I have brought them unto My holy mountain, And caused them  to rejoice in My house of prayer, Their burnt-offerings and  their sacrifices [Are] for a pleasing thing on Mine altar, For  My house, `A house of prayer,' Is called for all the peoples.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS56_8" data-id="IS56_8">An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah, Who is gathering the  outcasts of Israel: `Again I gather to him -- to his gathered  ones.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS56_9" data-id="IS56_9">Every beast of the field, Come to devour, every beast in  the forest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS56_10" data-id="IS56_10">Blind [are] his watchmen -- all of them, They have not  known, All of them [are] dumb dogs, they are not able to bark,  Dozing, lying down, loving to slumber.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS56_11" data-id="IS56_11">And the dogs [are] strong of desire, They have not known  sufficiency, And they [are] shepherds! They have not known  understanding, All of them to their own way they did turn, Each  to his dishonest gain from his quarter:</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS56_12" data-id="IS56_12">`Come ye, I take wine, And we drink, quaff strong drink,  And as this day hath been to-morrow, Great -- exceeding  abundant!'</span>
