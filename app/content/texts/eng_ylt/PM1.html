<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_2" data-id="PM1_2">and Apphia the beloved, and Archippus our fellow-soldier,  and the assembly in thy house:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_3" data-id="PM1_3">Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord  Jesus Christ!</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_4" data-id="PM1_4">I give thanks to my God, always making mention of thee in my  prayers,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_5" data-id="PM1_5">hearing of thy love and faith that thou hast unto the Lord  Jesus and toward all the saints,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_6" data-id="PM1_6">that the fellowship of thy faith may become working in the  full knowledge of every good thing that [is] in you toward  Christ Jesus;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_7" data-id="PM1_7">for we have much joy and comfort in thy love, because the  bowels of the saints have been refreshed through thee,  brother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_8" data-id="PM1_8">Wherefore, having in Christ much boldness to command thee  that which is fit --</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_9" data-id="PM1_9">because of the love I rather entreat, being such an one as  Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_10" data-id="PM1_10">I entreat thee concerning my child -- whom I did beget in  my bonds -- Onesimus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_11" data-id="PM1_11">who once was to thee unprofitable, and now is profitable to  me and to thee,</span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_13" data-id="PM1_13">whom I did wish to retain to myself, that in thy behalf he  might minister to me in the bonds of the good news,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_14" data-id="PM1_14">and apart from thy mind I willed to do nothing, that as of  necessity thy good deed may not be, but of willingness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_15" data-id="PM1_15">for perhaps because of this he did depart for an hour, that  age-duringly thou mayest have him,</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_17" data-id="PM1_17">If, then, with me thou hast fellowship, receive him as me,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_18" data-id="PM1_18">and if he did hurt to thee, or doth owe anything, this to  me be reckoning;</span>
