<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_2" data-id="HS9_2">Floor and wine-press do not delight them, And new wine doth  fail in her,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_3" data-id="HS9_3">They do not abide in the land of Jehovah, And turned back  hath Ephraim [to] Egypt, And in Asshur an unclean thing they  eat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_4" data-id="HS9_4">They pour not out wine to Jehovah, Nor are they sweet to  Him, Their sacrifices [are] as bread of mourners to them, All  eating it are unclean: For their bread [is] for themselves, It  doth not come into the house of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_5" data-id="HS9_5">What do ye at the day appointed? And at the day of Jehovah's  festival?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_6" data-id="HS9_6">For, lo, they have gone because of destruction, Egypt  gathereth them, Moph burieth them, The desirable things of  their silver, Nettles possess them -- a thorn [is] in their  tents.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_7" data-id="HS9_7">Come in have the days of inspection, Come in have the days  of recompence, Israel doth know! a fool [is] the prophet, Mad  [is] the man of the Spirit, Because of the abundance of thine  iniquity, And great [is] the hatred.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_8" data-id="HS9_8">Ephraim is looking [away] from My God, The prophet! a snare  of a fowler [is] over all his ways, Hatred [is] in the house of  his God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_9" data-id="HS9_9">They have gone deep -- have done corruptly, As [in] the days  of Gibeah, He doth remember their iniquity, He doth inspect  their sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_10" data-id="HS9_10">As grapes in a wilderness I found Israel, As the  first-fruit in a fig-tree, at its beginning, I have seen your  fathers, They -- they have gone in [to] Baal-Peor, And are  separated to a shameful thing, And are become abominable like  their love.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_11" data-id="HS9_11">Ephraim [is] as a fowl, Fly away doth their honour, without  birth, And without womb, and without conception.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_12" data-id="HS9_12">For though they nourish their sons, I have made them  childless -- without man, Surely also, wo to them, when I turn  aside from them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_13" data-id="HS9_13">Ephraim! when I have looked to the rock, Is planted in  comeliness, And Ephraim [is] to bring out unto a slayer his  sons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_14" data-id="HS9_14">Give to them, Jehovah -- what dost Thou give? Give to them  miscarrying womb, and dry breasts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_15" data-id="HS9_15">All their evil [is] in Gilgal, Surely there I have hated  them, Because of the evil of their doings, Out of My house I do  drive them, I add not to love them, all their heads [are]  apostates.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_16" data-id="HS9_16">Ephraim hath been smitten, Their root hath dried up, fruit  they yield not, Yea, though they bring forth, I have put to  death the desired of their womb.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_17" data-id="HS9_17">Reject them doth my God, Because they have not hearkened to  Him, And they are wanderers among nations!</span>
