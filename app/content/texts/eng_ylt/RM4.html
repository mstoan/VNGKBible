<div class="c">4</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM4_1" data-id="RM4_1">What, then, shall we say Abraham our father, to have found,  according to flesh?</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM4_2" data-id="RM4_2">for if Abraham by works was declared righteous, he hath to  boast -- but not before god;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM4_3" data-id="RM4_3">for what doth the writing say? `And Abraham did believe God,  and it was reckoned to him -- to righteousness;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM4_4" data-id="RM4_4">and to him who is working, the reward is not reckoned of  grace, but of debt;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM4_5" data-id="RM4_5">and to him who is not working, and is believing upon Him who  is declaring righteous the impious, his faith is reckoned -- to  righteousness:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM4_6" data-id="RM4_6">even as David also doth speak of the happiness of the man to  whom God doth reckon righteousness apart from works:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM4_7" data-id="RM4_7">`Happy they whose lawless acts were forgiven, and whose sins  were covered;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM4_8" data-id="RM4_8">happy the man to whom the Lord may not reckon sin.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM4_9" data-id="RM4_9">[Is] this happiness, then, upon the circumcision, or also  upon the uncircumcision -- for we say that the faith was  reckoned to Abraham -- to righteousness?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM4_10" data-id="RM4_10">how then was it reckoned? he being in circumcision, or in  uncircumcision? not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM4_11" data-id="RM4_11">and a sign he did receive of circumcision, a seal of the  righteousness of the faith in the uncircumcision, for his being  father of all those believing through uncircumcision, for the  righteousness also being reckoned to them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM4_12" data-id="RM4_12">and father of circumcision to those not of circumcision  only, but who also walk in the steps of the faith, that [is] in  the uncircumcision of our father Abraham.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM4_13" data-id="RM4_13">For not through law [is] the promise to Abraham, or to his  seed, of his being heir of the world, but through the  righteousness of faith;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM4_14" data-id="RM4_14">for if they who are of law [are] heirs, the faith hath been  made void, and the promise hath been made useless;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM4_15" data-id="RM4_15">for the law doth work wrath; for where law is not, neither  [is] transgression.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM4_16" data-id="RM4_16">Because of this [it is] of faith, that [it may be]  according to grace, for the promise being sure to all the  seed, not to that which [is] of the law only, but also to that  which [is] of the faith of Abraham,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM4_17" data-id="RM4_17">who is father of us all (according as it hath been written  -- `A father of many nations I have set thee,') before Him  whom he did believe -- God, who is quickening the dead, and is  calling the things that be not as being.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM4_18" data-id="RM4_18">Who, against hope in hope did believe, for his becoming  father of many nations according to that spoken: `So shall thy  seed be;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM4_19" data-id="RM4_19">and not having been weak in the faith, he did not consider  his own body, already become dead, (being about a hundred  years old,) and the deadness of Sarah's womb,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM4_20" data-id="RM4_20">and at the promise of God did not stagger in unbelief, but  was strengthened in faith, having given glory to God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM4_21" data-id="RM4_21">and having been fully persuaded that what He hath promised  He is able also to do:</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM4_22" data-id="RM4_22">wherefore also it was reckoned to him to righteousness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM4_23" data-id="RM4_23">And it was not written on his account alone, that it was  reckoned to him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM4_24" data-id="RM4_24">but also on ours, to whom it is about to be reckoned -- to  us believing on Him who did raise up Jesus our Lord out of the  dead,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM4_25" data-id="RM4_25">who was delivered up because of our offences, and was  raised up because of our being declared righteous.</span>
