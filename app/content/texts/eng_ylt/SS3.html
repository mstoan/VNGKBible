<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS3_2" data-id="SS3_2">-- Pray, let me rise, and go round the city, In the streets  and in the broad places, I seek him whom my soul hath loved! --  I sought him, and I found him not.</span>

<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS3_5" data-id="SS3_5">I have adjured you, daughters of Jerusalem, By the roes or  by the hinds of the field, Stir not up nor wake the love till  she please!</span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS3_10" data-id="SS3_10">Its pillars he made of silver, Its bottom of gold, its seat  of purple, Its midst lined [with] love, By the daughters of  Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v SS3_11" data-id="SS3_11">Go forth, and look, ye daughters of Zion, On king Solomon,  with the crown, With which his mother crowned him, In the day  of his espousals, And in the day of the joy of his heart!</span>
