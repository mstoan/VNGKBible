<div class="c">18</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_1" data-id="LK18_1">And he spake also a simile to them, that it behoveth [us]  always to pray, and not to faint,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_2" data-id="LK18_2">saying, `A certain judge was in a certain city -- God he is  not fearing, and man he is not regarding --</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_3" data-id="LK18_3">and a widow was in that city, and she was coming unto him,  saying, Do me justice on my opponent,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_4" data-id="LK18_4">and he would not for a time, but after these things he said  in himself, Even if God I do not fear, and man do not regard,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_5" data-id="LK18_5">yet because this widow doth give me trouble, I will do her  justice, lest, perpetually coming, she may plague me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_6" data-id="LK18_6">And the Lord said, `Hear ye what the unrighteous judge  saith:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_7" data-id="LK18_7">and shall not God execute the justice to His choice ones,  who are crying unto Him day and night -- bearing long in  regard to them?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_8" data-id="LK18_8">I say to you, that He will execute the justice to them  quickly; but the Son of Man having come, shall he find the  faith upon the earth?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_9" data-id="LK18_9">And he spake also unto certain who have been trusting in  themselves that they were righteous, and have been despising  the rest, this simile:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_10" data-id="LK18_10">`Two men went up to the temple to pray, the one a  Pharisee, and the other a tax-gatherer;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_11" data-id="LK18_11">the Pharisee having stood by himself, thus prayed: God, I  thank Thee that I am not as the rest of men, rapacious,  unrighteous, adulterers, or even as this tax-gatherer;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_12" data-id="LK18_12">I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all things --  as many as I possess.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_13" data-id="LK18_13">`And the tax-gatherer, having stood afar off, would not  even the eyes lift up to the heaven, but was smiting on his  breast, saying, God be propitious to me -- the sinner!</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_14" data-id="LK18_14">I say to you, this one went down declared righteous, to  his house, rather than that one: for every one who is exalting  himself shall be humbled, and he who is humbling himself shall  be exalted.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_15" data-id="LK18_15">And they were bringing near also the babes, that he may  touch them, and the disciples having seen did rebuke them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_16" data-id="LK18_16">and Jesus having called them near, said, `Suffer the  little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of  such is the reign of God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_17" data-id="LK18_17">verily I say to you, Whoever may not receive the reign of  God as a little child, may not enter into it.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_18" data-id="LK18_18">And a certain ruler questioned him, saying, `Good teacher,  what having done -- shall I inherit life age-during?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_19" data-id="LK18_19">And Jesus said to him, `Why me dost thou call good? no one  [is] good, except One -- God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_20" data-id="LK18_20">the commands thou hast known: Thou mayest not commit  adultery, Thou mayest do no murder, Thou mayest not steal, Thou  mayest not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy  mother.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_21" data-id="LK18_21">And he said, `All these I did keep from my youth;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_22" data-id="LK18_22">and having heard these things, Jesus said to him, `Yet one  thing to thee is lacking; all things -- as many as thou hast --  sell, and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure  in heaven, and come, be following me;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_23" data-id="LK18_23">and he, having heard these things, became very sorrowful,  for he was exceeding rich.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_24" data-id="LK18_24">And Jesus having seen him become very sorrowful, said,  `How hardly shall those having riches enter into the reign of  God!</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_25" data-id="LK18_25">for it is easier for a camel through the eye of a needle  to enter, than for a rich man into the reign of God to enter.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_26" data-id="LK18_26">And those who heard, said, `And who is able to be saved?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_27" data-id="LK18_27">and he said, `The things impossible with men are possible  with God.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_28" data-id="LK18_28">And Peter said, `Lo, we left all, and did follow thee;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_29" data-id="LK18_29">and he said to them, `Verily I say to you, that there is  not one who left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or  children, for the sake of the reign of God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_30" data-id="LK18_30">who may not receive back manifold more in this time, and  in the coming age, life age-during.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_31" data-id="LK18_31">And having taken the twelve aside, he said unto them, `Lo,  we go up to Jerusalem, and all things shall be completed --  that have been written through the prophets -- to the Son of  Man,</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_32" data-id="LK18_32">for he shall be delivered up to the nations, and shall be  mocked, and insulted, and spit upon,</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_33" data-id="LK18_33">and having scourged they shall put him to death, and on  the third day he shall rise again.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_34" data-id="LK18_34">And they none of these things understood, and this saying  was hid from them, and they were not knowing the things said.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_35" data-id="LK18_35">And it came to pass, in his coming nigh to Jericho, a  certain blind man was sitting beside the way begging,</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_36" data-id="LK18_36">and having heard a multitude going by, he was inquiring  what this may be,</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_37" data-id="LK18_37">and they brought him word that Jesus the Nazarene doth  pass by,</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_38" data-id="LK18_38">and he cried out, saying, `Jesus, Son of David, deal  kindly with me;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_39" data-id="LK18_39">and those going before were rebuking him, that he might be  silent, but he was much more crying out, `Son of David, deal  kindly with me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_40" data-id="LK18_40">And Jesus having stood, commanded him to be brought unto  him, and he having come nigh, he questioned him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_41" data-id="LK18_41">saying, `What wilt thou I shall do to thee?' and he said,  `Sir, that I may receive sight.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_42" data-id="LK18_42">And Jesus said to him, `Receive thy sight; thy faith hath  saved thee;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK18_43" data-id="LK18_43">and presently he did receive sight, and was following him,  glorifying God; and all the people, having seen, did give  praise to God.</span>
