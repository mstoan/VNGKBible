<div class="c">23</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_1" data-id="LK23_1">And having risen, the whole multitude of them did lead him  to Pilate,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_2" data-id="LK23_2">and began to accuse him, saying, `This one we found  perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to  Caesar, saying himself to be Christ a king.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_3" data-id="LK23_3">And Pilate questioned him, saying, `Thou art the king of  the Jews?' and he answering him, said, `Thou dost say [it].'</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_4" data-id="LK23_4">And Pilate said unto the chief priests, and the multitude,  `I find no fault in this man;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_5" data-id="LK23_5">and they were the more urgent, saying -- `He doth stir up  the people, teaching throughout the whole of Judea -- having  begun from Galilee -- unto this place.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_6" data-id="LK23_6">And Pilate having heard of Galilee, questioned if the man  is a Galilean,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_7" data-id="LK23_7">and having known that he is from the jurisdiction of Herod,  he sent him back unto Herod, he being also in Jerusalem in  those days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_8" data-id="LK23_8">And Herod having seen Jesus did rejoice exceedingly, for he  was wishing for a long [time] to see him, because of hearing  many things about him, and he was hoping some sign to see done  by him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_9" data-id="LK23_9">and was questioning him in many words, and he answered him  nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_10" data-id="LK23_10">And the chief priests and the scribes stood vehemently  accusing him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_11" data-id="LK23_11">and Herod with his soldiers having set him at nought, and  having mocked, having put around him gorgeous apparel, did  send him back to Pilate,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_12" data-id="LK23_12">and both Pilate and Herod became friends on that day with  one another, for they were before at enmity between  themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_13" data-id="LK23_13">And Pilate having called together the chief priests, and  the rulers, and the people,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_14" data-id="LK23_14">said unto them, `Ye brought to me this man as perverting  the people, and lo, I before you having examined, found in  this man no fault in those things ye bring forward against  him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_15" data-id="LK23_15">no, nor yet Herod, for I sent you back unto him, and lo,  nothing worthy of death is having been done by him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_16" data-id="LK23_16">having chastised, therefore, I will release him,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_17" data-id="LK23_17">for it was necessary for him to release to them one at  every feast,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_18" data-id="LK23_18">and they cried out -- the whole multitude -- saying, `Away  with this one, and release to us Barabbas,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_19" data-id="LK23_19">who had been, because of a certain sedition made in the  city, and murder, cast into prison.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_20" data-id="LK23_20">Pilate again then -- wishing to release Jesus -- called to  them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_21" data-id="LK23_21">but they were calling out, saying, `Crucify, crucify him.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_22" data-id="LK23_22">And he a third time said unto them, `Why, what evil did  he? no cause of death did I find in him; having chastised him,  then, I will release [him].'</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_23" data-id="LK23_23">And they were pressing with loud voices asking him to be  crucified, and their voices, and those of the chief priests,  were prevailing,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_24" data-id="LK23_24">and Pilate gave judgment for their request being done,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_25" data-id="LK23_25">and he released him who because of sedition and murder  hath been cast into the prison, whom they were asking, and  Jesus he gave up to their will.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_26" data-id="LK23_26">And as they led him away, having taken hold on Simon, a  certain Cyrenian, coming from the field, they put on him the  cross, to bear [it] behind Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_27" data-id="LK23_27">And there was following him a great multitude of the  people, and of women, who also were beating themselves and  lamenting him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_28" data-id="LK23_28">and Jesus having turned unto them, said, `Daughters of  Jerusalem, weep not for me, but for yourselves weep ye, and for  your children;</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_29" data-id="LK23_29">for, lo, days do come, in which they shall say, Happy the  barren, and wombs that did not bare, and paps that did not give  suck;</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_30" data-id="LK23_30">then they shall begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us,  and to the hills, Cover us; --</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_31" data-id="LK23_31">for, if in the green tree they do these things -- in the  dry what may happen?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_32" data-id="LK23_32">And there were also others -- two evil-doers -- with him,  to be put to death;</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_33" data-id="LK23_33">and when they came to the place that is called Skull,  there they crucified him and the evil-doers, one on the right  hand and one on the left.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_34" data-id="LK23_34">And Jesus said, `Father, forgive them, for they have not  known what they do;' and parting his garments they cast a lot.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_35" data-id="LK23_35">And the people were standing, looking on, and the rulers  also were sneering with them, saying, `Others he saved, let him  save himself, if this be the Christ, the choice one of God.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_36" data-id="LK23_36">And mocking him also were the soldiers, coming near and  offering vinegar to him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_37" data-id="LK23_37">and saying, `If thou be the king of the Jews, save  thyself.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_38" data-id="LK23_38">And there was also a superscription written over him, in  letters of Greek, and Roman, and Hebrew, `This is the King of  the Jews.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_39" data-id="LK23_39">And one of the evil-doers who were hanged, was speaking  evil of him, saying, `If thou be the Christ, save thyself and  us.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_40" data-id="LK23_40">And the other answering, was rebuking him, saying, `Dost  thou not even fear God, that thou art in the same judgment?</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_41" data-id="LK23_41">and we indeed righteously, for things worthy of what we  did we receive back, but this one did nothing out of place;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_42" data-id="LK23_42">and he said to Jesus, `Remember me, lord, when thou mayest  come in thy reign;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_43" data-id="LK23_43">and Jesus said to him, `Verily I say to thee, To-day with  me thou shalt be in the paradise.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_44" data-id="LK23_44">And it was, as it were, the sixth hour, and darkness came  over all the land till the ninth hour,</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_45" data-id="LK23_45">and the sun was darkened, and the vail of the sanctuary  was rent in the midst,</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_46" data-id="LK23_46">and having cried with a loud voice, Jesus said, `Father,  to Thy hands I commit my spirit;' and these things having said,  he breathed forth the spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_47" data-id="LK23_47">And the centurion having seen what was done, did glorify  God, saying, `Really this man was righteous;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_48" data-id="LK23_48">and all the multitudes who were come together to this  sight, beholding the things that came to pass, smiting their  breasts did turn back;</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_49" data-id="LK23_49">and all his acquaintances stood afar off, and women who  did follow him from Galilee, beholding these things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_50" data-id="LK23_50">And lo, a man, by name Joseph, being a counsellor, a man  good and righteous,</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_51" data-id="LK23_51">-- he was not consenting to their counsel and deed -- from  Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who also himself was expecting  the reign of God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_52" data-id="LK23_52">he, having gone near to Pilate, asked the body of Jesus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_53" data-id="LK23_53">and having taken it down, he wrapped it in fine linen, and  placed it in a tomb hewn out, where no one was yet laid.</span>
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_54" data-id="LK23_54">And the day was a preparation, and sabbath was  approaching,</span>
<span class="v-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_55" data-id="LK23_55">and the women also who have come with him out of Galilee  having followed after, beheld the tomb, and how his body was  placed,</span>
<span class="v-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_56" data-id="LK23_56">and having turned back, they made ready spices and  ointments, and on the sabbath, indeed, they rested, according  to the command.</span>
