<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_2" data-id="GN45_2">and he giveth forth his voice in weeping, and the Egyptians  hear, and the house of Pharaoh heareth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_3" data-id="GN45_3">And Joseph saith unto his brethren, `I [am] Joseph, is my  father yet alive?' and his brethren have not been able to  answer him, for they have been troubled at his presence.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_4" data-id="GN45_4">And Joseph saith unto his brethren, `Come nigh unto me, I  pray you,' and they come nigh; and he saith, `I [am] Joseph,  your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_5" data-id="GN45_5">and now, be not grieved, nor let it be displeasing in your  eyes that ye sold me hither, for to preserve life hath God sent  me before you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_6" data-id="GN45_6">`Because these two years the famine [is] in the heart of  the land, and yet [are] five years, [in] which there is neither  ploughing nor harvest;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_7" data-id="GN45_7">and God sendeth me before you, to place of you a remnant in  the land, and to give life to you by a great escape;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_8" data-id="GN45_8">and now, ye -- ye have not sent me hither, but God, and He  doth set me for a father to Pharaoh, and for lord to all his  house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_9" data-id="GN45_9">`Haste, and go up unto my father, then ye have said to him,  Thus said Joseph thy son, God hath set me for lord to all  Egypt; come down unto me, stay not,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_10" data-id="GN45_10">and thou hast dwelt in the land of Goshen, and been near  unto me, thou and thy sons, and thy son's sons, and thy flock,  and thy herd, and all that thou hast,</span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_22" data-id="GN45_22">to all of them hath he given -- to each changes of  garments, and to Benjamin he hath given three hundred  silverlings, and five changes of garments;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_23" data-id="GN45_23">and to his father he hath sent thus: ten asses bearing of  the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses bearing corn and  bread, even food for his father for the way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_24" data-id="GN45_24">And he sendeth his brethren away, and they go; and he  saith unto them, `Be not angry in the way.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_27" data-id="GN45_27">And they speak unto him all the words of Joseph, which he  hath spoken unto them, and he seeth the waggons which Joseph  hath sent to bear him away, and live doth the spirit of Jacob  their father;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_28" data-id="GN45_28">and Israel saith, `Enough! Joseph my son [is] yet alive; I  go and see him before I die.'</span>
