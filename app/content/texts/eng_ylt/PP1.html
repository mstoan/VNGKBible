<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_2" data-id="PP1_2">Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord  Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_3" data-id="PP1_3">I give thanks to my God upon all the remembrance of you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_4" data-id="PP1_4">always, in every supplication of mine for you all, with joy  making the supplication,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_5" data-id="PP1_5">for your contribution to the good news from the first day  till now,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_6" data-id="PP1_6">having been confident of this very thing, that He who did  begin in you a good work, will perform [it] till a day of  Jesus Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_7" data-id="PP1_7">according as it is righteous for me to think this in behalf  of you all, because of my having you in the heart, both in my  bonds, and [in] the defence and confirmation of the good news,  all of you being fellow-partakers with me of grace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_8" data-id="PP1_8">For God is my witness, how I long for you all in the bowels  of Jesus Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_9" data-id="PP1_9">and this I pray, that your love yet more and more may abound  in full knowledge, and all judgment,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_10" data-id="PP1_10">for your proving the things that differ, that ye may be  pure and offenceless -- to a day of Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_11" data-id="PP1_11">being filled with the fruit of righteousness, that [is]  through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_12" data-id="PP1_12">And I wish you to know, brethren, that the things  concerning me, rather to an advancement of the good news have  come,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_13" data-id="PP1_13">so that my bonds have become manifest in Christ in the  whole praetorium, and to the other places -- all,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_14" data-id="PP1_14">and the greater part of the brethren in the Lord, having  confidence by my bonds, are more abundantly bold -- fearlessly  to speak the word.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_15" data-id="PP1_15">Certain, indeed, even through envy and contention, and  certain also through good-will, do preach the Christ;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_16" data-id="PP1_16">the one, indeed, of rivalry the Christ do proclaim, not  purely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_17" data-id="PP1_17">and the other out of love, having known that for defence of  the good news I am set:</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_18" data-id="PP1_18">what then? in every way, whether in pretence or in truth,  Christ is proclaimed -- and in this I rejoice, yea, and shall  rejoice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_19" data-id="PP1_19">For I have known that this shall fall out to me for  salvation, through your supplication, and the supply of the  Spirit of Christ Jesus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_20" data-id="PP1_20">according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in  nothing I shall be ashamed, and in all freedom, as always, also  now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life  or through death,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_21" data-id="PP1_21">for to me to live [is] Christ, and to die gain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_22" data-id="PP1_22">And if to live in the flesh [is] to me a fruit of work,  then what shall I choose? I know not;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_23" data-id="PP1_23">for I am pressed by the two, having the desire to depart,  and to be with Christ, for it is far better,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_24" data-id="PP1_24">and to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your  account,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_25" data-id="PP1_25">and of this being persuaded, I have known that I shall  remain and continue with you all, to your advancement and joy  of the faith,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_26" data-id="PP1_26">that your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus in me through  my presence again to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_27" data-id="PP1_27">Only worthily of the good news of the Christ conduct ye  yourselves, that, whether having come and seen you, whether  being absent I may hear of the things concerning you, that ye  stand fast in one spirit, with one soul, striving together for  the faith of the good news,</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_28" data-id="PP1_28">and not terrified in anything by those opposing, which to  them indeed is a token of destruction, and to you of  salvation, and that from God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_29" data-id="PP1_29">because to you it was granted, on behalf of Christ, not  only to believe in him, but also on behalf of him to suffer;</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_30" data-id="PP1_30">the same conflict having, such as ye saw in me, and now  hear of in me.</span>
