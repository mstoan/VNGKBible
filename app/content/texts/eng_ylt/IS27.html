<div class="c">27</div><div class="p"><span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS27_1" data-id="IS27_1">In that day lay a charge doth Jehovah, With his sword --  the sharp, and the great, and the strong, On leviathan -- a  fleeing serpent, And on leviathan -- a crooked serpent, And He  hath slain the dragon that [is] in the sea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS27_2" data-id="IS27_2">In that day, `A desirable vineyard,' respond ye to her,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS27_3" data-id="IS27_3">I, Jehovah, am its keeper, every moment I water it, Lest  any lay a charge against it, Night and day I keep it!</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS27_4" data-id="IS27_4">Fury is not in Me; Who giveth Me a brier -- a thorn in  battle? I step into it, I burn it at once.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS27_5" data-id="IS27_5">Or -- he doth take hold on My strength, He doth make peace  with Me, Peace he doth make with Me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS27_6" data-id="IS27_6">Those coming in He causeth to take root, Jacob doth  blossom, and flourished hath Israel, And they have filled the  face of the world [with] increase.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS27_7" data-id="IS27_7">As the smiting of his smiter hath He smitten him? As the  slaying of his slain doth He slay?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS27_8" data-id="IS27_8">In measure, in sending it forth, thou strivest with it, He  hath taken away by His sharp wind, In the day of an east wind,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS27_9" data-id="IS27_9">Therefore by this is the iniquity of Jacob covered, And  this [is] all the fruit -- To take away his sin, in His setting  all the stones of an altar, As chalkstones beaten in pieces,  They rise not -- shrines and images.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS27_10" data-id="IS27_10">For the fenced city [is] alone, A habitation cast out and  forsaken as a wilderness, There doth the calf delight, And  there it lieth down, And hath consumed its branches.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS27_11" data-id="IS27_11">In the withering of its branch it is broken off, Women are  coming in setting it on fire, For it [is] not a people of  understanding, Therefore pity it not doth its Maker, And its  Former doth not favour it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS27_12" data-id="IS27_12">And it hath come to pass, in that day, Beat out doth  Jehovah from the branch of the river, Unto the stream of Egypt,  And ye are gathered one by one, O sons of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS27_13" data-id="IS27_13">And it hath come to pass, in that day, It is blown with a  great trumpet, And come in have those perishing in the land of  Asshur, And those cast out in the land of Egypt, And have bowed  themselves to Jehovah, In the holy mount -- in Jerusalem!</span>
