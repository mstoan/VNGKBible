<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_2" data-id="C113_2">and if I have prophecy, and know all the secrets, and all  the knowledge, and if I have all the faith, so as to remove  mountains, and have not love, I am nothing;</span>

<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_4" data-id="C113_4">The love is long-suffering, it is kind, the love doth not  envy, the love doth not vaunt itself, is not puffed up,</span>
