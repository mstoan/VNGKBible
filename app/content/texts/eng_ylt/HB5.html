<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_2" data-id="HB5_2">able to be gentle to those ignorant and going astray, since  himself also is compassed with infirmity;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_3" data-id="HB5_3">and because of this infirmity he ought, as for the people,  so also for himself to offer for sins;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_4" data-id="HB5_4">and no one to himself doth take the honour, but he who is  called by God, as also Aaron:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_5" data-id="HB5_5">so also the Christ did not glorify himself to become chief  priest, but He who spake unto him: `My Son thou art, I to-day  have begotten thee;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_6" data-id="HB5_6">as also in another [place] He saith, `Thou [art] a priest --  to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_7" data-id="HB5_7">who in the days of his flesh both prayers and supplications  unto Him who was able to save him from death -- with strong  crying and tears -- having offered up, and having been heard  in respect to that which he feared,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_8" data-id="HB5_8">through being a Son, did learn by the things which he  suffered -- the obedience,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_9" data-id="HB5_9">and having been made perfect, he did become to all those  obeying him a cause of salvation age-during,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_10" data-id="HB5_10">having been addressed by God a chief priest, according to  the order of Melchisedek,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_11" data-id="HB5_11">concerning whom we have much discourse and of hard  explanation to say, since ye have become dull of hearing,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_12" data-id="HB5_12">for even owing to be teachers, because of the time, again  ye have need that one teach you what [are] the elements of the  beginning of the oracles of God, and ye have become having  need of milk, and not of strong food,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_13" data-id="HB5_13">for every one who is partaking of milk [is] unskilled in  the word of righteousness -- for he is an infant,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_14" data-id="HB5_14">and of perfect men is the strong food, who because of the  use are having the senses exercised, unto the discernment both  of good and of evil.</span>
