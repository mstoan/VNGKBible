<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_2" data-id="LK22_2">and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they  may take him up, for they were afraid of the people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_3" data-id="LK22_3">And the Adversary entered into Judas, who is surnamed  Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_4" data-id="LK22_4">and he, having gone away, spake with the chief priests and  the magistrates, how he might deliver him up to them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_5" data-id="LK22_5">and they rejoiced, and covenanted to give him money,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_6" data-id="LK22_6">and he agreed, and was seeking a favourable season to  deliver him up to them without tumult.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_7" data-id="LK22_7">And the day of the unleavened food came, in which it was  behoving the passover to be sacrificed,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_8" data-id="LK22_8">and he sent Peter and John, saying, `Having gone on,  prepare to us the passover, that we may eat;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_9" data-id="LK22_9">and they said to him, `Where wilt thou that we might  prepare?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_10" data-id="LK22_10">And he said to them, `Lo, in your entering into the city,  there shall meet you a man, bearing a pitcher of water, follow  him to the house where he doth go in,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_11" data-id="LK22_11">and ye shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher  saith to thee, Where is the guest-chamber where the passover  with my disciples I may eat?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_12" data-id="LK22_12">and he shall show you a large upper room furnished, there  make ready;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_13" data-id="LK22_13">and they, having gone away, found as he hath said to them,  and they made ready the passover.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_14" data-id="LK22_14">And when the hour come, he reclined (at meat), and the  twelve apostles with him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_15" data-id="LK22_15">and he said unto them, `With desire I did desire to eat  this passover with you before my suffering,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_16" data-id="LK22_16">for I say to you, that no more may I eat of it till it may  be fulfilled in the reign of God.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_17" data-id="LK22_17">And having taken a cup, having given thanks, he said,  `Take this and divide to yourselves,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_18" data-id="LK22_18">for I say to you that I may not drink of the produce of  the vine till the reign of God may come.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_19" data-id="LK22_19">And having taken bread, having given thanks, he brake and  gave to them, saying, `This is my body, that for you is being  given, this do ye -- to remembrance of me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_20" data-id="LK22_20">In like manner, also, the cup after the supping, saying,  `This cup [is] the new covenant in my blood, that for you is  being poured forth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_21" data-id="LK22_21">`But, lo, the hand of him delivering me up [is] with me on  the table,</span>

<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_23" data-id="LK22_23">And they began to reason among themselves, who then of  them it may be, who is about to do this thing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_24" data-id="LK22_24">And there happened also a strife among them -- who of them  is accounted to be greater.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_25" data-id="LK22_25">And he said to them, `The kings of the nations do exercise  lordship over them, and those exercising authority upon them  are called benefactors;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_26" data-id="LK22_26">but ye [are] not so, but he who is greater among you --  let him be as the younger; and he who is leading, as he who is  ministering;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_27" data-id="LK22_27">for who is greater? he who is reclining (at meat), or he  who is ministering? is it not he who is reclining (at meat)?  and I -- I am in your midst as he who is ministering.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_28" data-id="LK22_28">`And ye -- ye are those who have remained with me in my  temptations,</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_29" data-id="LK22_29">and I appoint to you, as my Father did appoint to me, a  kingdom,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_30" data-id="LK22_30">that ye may eat and may drink at my table, in my kingdom,  and may sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_31" data-id="LK22_31">And the Lord said, `Simon, Simon, lo, the Adversary did  ask you for himself to sift as the wheat,</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_32" data-id="LK22_32">and I besought for thee, that thy faith may not fail; and  thou, when thou didst turn, strengthen thy brethren.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_33" data-id="LK22_33">And he said to him, `Sir, with thee I am ready both to  prison and to death to go;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_34" data-id="LK22_34">and he said, `I say to thee, Peter, a cock shall not crow  to-day, before thrice thou mayest disown knowing me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_35" data-id="LK22_35">And he said to them, `When I sent you without bag, and  scrip, and sandals, did ye lack anything?' and they said,  `Nothing.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_36" data-id="LK22_36">Then said he to them, `But, now, he who is having a bag,  let him take [it] up, and in like manner also a scrip; and he  who is not having, let him sell his garment, and buy a sword,</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_37" data-id="LK22_37">for I say to you, that yet this that hath been written it  behoveth to be fulfilled in me: And with lawless ones he was  reckoned, for also the things concerning me have an end.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_38" data-id="LK22_38">And they said, `Sir, lo, here [are] two swords;' and he  said to them, `It is sufficient.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_39" data-id="LK22_39">And having gone forth, he went on, according to custom, to  the mount of the Olives, and his disciples also followed him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_40" data-id="LK22_40">and having come to the place, he said to them, `Pray ye  not to enter into temptation.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_41" data-id="LK22_41">And he was withdrawn from them, as it were a stone's cast,  and having fallen on the knees he was praying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_42" data-id="LK22_42">saying, `Father, if Thou be counselling to make this cup  pass from me --; but, not my will, but Thine be done.' --</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_43" data-id="LK22_43">And there appeared to him a messenger from heaven  strengthening him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_44" data-id="LK22_44">and having been in agony, he was more earnestly praying,  and his sweat became, as it were, great drops of blood falling  upon the ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_45" data-id="LK22_45">And having risen up from the prayer, having come unto the  disciples, he found them sleeping from the sorrow,</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_46" data-id="LK22_46">and he said to them, `Why do ye sleep? having risen, pray  that ye may not enter into temptation.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_47" data-id="LK22_47">And while he is speaking, lo, a multitude, and he who is  called Judas, one of the twelve, was coming before them, and he  came nigh to Jesus to kiss him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_48" data-id="LK22_48">and Jesus said to him, `Judas, with a kiss the Son of Man  dost thou deliver up?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_49" data-id="LK22_49">And those about him, having seen what was about to be,  said to him, `Sir, shall we smite with a sword?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_50" data-id="LK22_50">And a certain one of them smote the servant of the chief  priest, and took off his right ear,</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_51" data-id="LK22_51">and Jesus answering said, `Suffer ye thus far,' and having  touched his ear, he healed him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_52" data-id="LK22_52">And Jesus said to those having come upon him -- chief  priests, and magistrates of the temple, and elders -- `As upon  a robber have ye come forth, with swords and sticks?</span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_53" data-id="LK22_53">while daily I was with you in the temple, ye did stretch  forth no hands against me; but this is your hour and the power  of the darkness.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_54" data-id="LK22_54">And having taken him, they led and brought him to the  house of the chief priest. And Peter was following afar off,</span>
<span class="v-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_55" data-id="LK22_55">and they having kindled a fire in the midst of the court,  and having sat down together, Peter was sitting in the midst  of them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_56" data-id="LK22_56">and a certain maid having seen him sitting at the light,  and having earnestly looked at him, she said, `And this one  was with him!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_57" data-id="LK22_57">and he disowned him, saying, `Woman, I have not known  him.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_58" data-id="LK22_58">And after a little, another having seen him, said, `And  thou art of them!' and Peter said, `Man, I am not.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-59">59&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_59" data-id="LK22_59">And one hour, as it were, having intervened, a certain  other was confidently affirming, saying, `Of a truth this one  also was with him, for he is also a Galilean;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-60">60&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_60" data-id="LK22_60">and Peter said, `Man, I have not known what thou sayest;'  and presently, while he is speaking, a cock crew.</span>
<span class="v-num v-61">61&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_61" data-id="LK22_61">And the Lord having turned did look on Peter, and Peter  remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him -- `Before  a cock shall crow, thou mayest disown me thrice;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-62">62&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_62" data-id="LK22_62">and Peter having gone without, wept bitterly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-63">63&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_63" data-id="LK22_63">And the men who were holding Jesus were mocking him,  beating [him];</span>
<span class="v-num v-64">64&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_64" data-id="LK22_64">and having blindfolded him, they were striking him on the  face, and were questioning him, saying, `Prophesy who he is  who smote thee?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-65">65&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_65" data-id="LK22_65">and many other things, speaking evilly, they spake in  regard to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-66">66&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_66" data-id="LK22_66">And when it became day there was gathered together the  eldership of the people, chief priests also, and scribes, and  they led him up to their own sanhedrim,</span>
<span class="v-num v-67">67&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_67" data-id="LK22_67">saying, `If thou be the Christ, tell us.' And he said to  them, `If I may tell you, ye will not believe;</span>
<span class="v-num v-68">68&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_68" data-id="LK22_68">and if I also question [you], ye will not answer me or  send me away;</span>
<span class="v-num v-69">69&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_69" data-id="LK22_69">henceforth, there shall be the Son of Man sitting on the  right hand of the power of God.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-70">70&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_70" data-id="LK22_70">And they all said, `Thou, then, art the Son of God?' and  he said unto them, `Ye say [it], because I am;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-71">71&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK22_71" data-id="LK22_71">and they said, `What need yet have we of testimony? for we  ourselves did hear [it] from his mouth.'</span>
