<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_2" data-id="NU11_2">And the people cry unto Moses, and Moses prayeth unto  Jehovah, and the fire is quenched;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_3" data-id="NU11_3">and he calleth the name of that place Taberah, for the fire  of Jehovah hath `burned' among them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_4" data-id="NU11_4">And the rabble who [are] in its midst have lusted greatly,  and the sons of Israel also turn back and weep, and say, `Who  doth give us flesh?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_5" data-id="NU11_5">We have remembered the fish which we do eat in Egypt for  nought, the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the  onions, and the garlick;</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_7" data-id="NU11_7">And the manna is as coriander seed, and its aspect as the  aspect of bdolach;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_8" data-id="NU11_8">the people have turned aside and gathered [it], and ground  [it] with millstones, or beat [it] in a mortar, and boiled  [it] in a pan, and made it cakes, and its taste hath been as  the taste of the moisture of oil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_9" data-id="NU11_9">And in the descending of the dew on the camp by night, the  manna descendeth upon it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_10" data-id="NU11_10">And Moses heareth the people weeping by its families, each  at the opening of his tent, and the anger of Jehovah burneth  exceedingly, and in the eyes of Moses [it is] evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_11" data-id="NU11_11">And Moses saith unto Jehovah, `Why hast Thou done evil to  Thy servant? and why have I not found grace in Thine eyes -- to  put the burden of all this people upon me?</span>

<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_21" data-id="NU11_21">And Moses saith, `Six hundred thousand footmen [are] the  people in whose midst I [am]; and Thou, Thou hast said, Flesh I  give to them, and they have eaten, a month of days!</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_22" data-id="NU11_22">Is flock and herd slaughtered for them, that one hath  found for them? -- are all the fishes of the sea gathered for  them -- that one hath found for them?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_23" data-id="NU11_23">And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Is the hand of Jehovah  become short? now thou dost see whether My word meeteth thee or  not.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_24" data-id="NU11_24">And Moses goeth out, and speaketh unto the people the  words of Jehovah, and gathereth seventy men of the elders of  the people, and causeth them to stand round about the tent,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_25" data-id="NU11_25">and Jehovah cometh down in the cloud, and speaketh unto  him, and keepeth back of the Spirit which [is] on him, and  putteth on the seventy men of the elders; and it cometh to pass  at the resting of the Spirit on them, that they prophesy, and  do not cease.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_26" data-id="NU11_26">And two of the men are left in the camp, the name of the  one [is] Eldad, and the name of the second Medad, and the  spirit resteth upon them, (and they are among those written,  and have not gone out to the tent), and they prophesy in the  camp;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_27" data-id="NU11_27">and the young man runneth, and declareth to Moses, and  saith, `Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_28" data-id="NU11_28">And Joshua son of Nun, minister of Moses, [one] of his  young men, answereth and saith, `My lord Moses, restrain them.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_29" data-id="NU11_29">And Moses saith to him, `Art thou zealous for me? O that  all Jehovah's people were prophets! that Jehovah would put His  Spirit upon them!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_30" data-id="NU11_30">And Moses is gathered unto the camp, he and the elders of  Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_31" data-id="NU11_31">And a spirit hath journeyed from Jehovah, and cutteth off  quails from the sea, and leaveth by the camp, as a day's  journey here, and as a day's journey there, round about the  camp, and about two cubits, on the face of the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_32" data-id="NU11_32">And the people rise all that day, and all the night, and  all the day after, and gather the quails -- he who hath least  hath gathered ten homers -- and they spread them out for  themselves round about the camp.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_33" data-id="NU11_33">The flesh is yet between their teeth -- it is not yet cut  off -- and the anger of Jehovah hath burned among the people,  and Jehovah smiteth among the people -- a very great smiting;</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_34" data-id="NU11_34">and [one] calleth the name of that place  Kibroth-Hattaavah, for there they have buried the people who  lust.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_35" data-id="NU11_35">From Kibroth-Hattaavah have the people journeyed to  Hazeroth, and they are in Hazeroth.</span>
