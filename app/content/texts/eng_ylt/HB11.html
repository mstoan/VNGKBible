<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_3" data-id="HB11_3">by faith we understand the ages to have been prepared by a  saying of God, in regard to the things seen not having come  out of things appearing;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_4" data-id="HB11_4">by faith a better sacrifice did Abel offer to God than  Cain, through which he was testified to be righteous, God  testifying of his gifts, and through it, he being dead, doth  yet speak.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_5" data-id="HB11_5">By faith Enoch was translated -- not to see death, and was  not found, because God did translate him; for before his  translation he had been testified to -- that he had pleased  God well,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_6" data-id="HB11_6">and apart from faith it is impossible to please well, for  it behoveth him who is coming to God to believe that He is,  and to those seeking Him He becometh a rewarder.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_7" data-id="HB11_7">By faith Noah, having been divinely warned concerning the  things not yet seen, having feared, did prepare an ark to the  salvation of his house, through which he did condemn the  world, and of the righteousness according to faith he became  heir.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_8" data-id="HB11_8">By faith Abraham, being called, did obey, to go forth to  the place that he was about to receive for an inheritance, and  he went forth, not knowing whither he doth go;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_9" data-id="HB11_9">by faith he did sojourn in the land of the promise as a  strange country, in tabernacles having dwelt with Isaac and  Jacob, fellow-heirs of the same promise,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_10" data-id="HB11_10">for he was looking for the city having the foundations,  whose artificer and constructor [is] God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_11" data-id="HB11_11">By faith also Sarah herself did receive power to conceive  seed, and she bare after the time of life, seeing she did  judge Him faithful who did promise;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_12" data-id="HB11_12">wherefore, also from one were begotten -- and that of one  who had become dead -- as the stars of the heaven in multitude,  and as sand that [is] by the sea-shore -- the innumerable.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_13" data-id="HB11_13">In faith died all these, not having received the promises,  but from afar having seen them, and having been persuaded, and  having saluted [them], and having confessed that strangers and  sojourners they are upon the earth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_14" data-id="HB11_14">for those saying such things make manifest that they seek  a country;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_15" data-id="HB11_15">and if, indeed, they had been mindful of that from which  they came forth, they might have had an opportunity to return,</span>

<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_32" data-id="HB11_32">And what shall I yet say? for the time will fail me  recounting about Gideon, Barak also, and Samson, and Jephthah,  David also, and Samuel, and the prophets,</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB11_33" data-id="HB11_33">who through faith did subdue kingdoms, wrought  righteousness, obtained promises, stopped mouths of lions,</span>
