<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_2" data-id="MT2_2">saying, `Where is he who was born king of the Jews? for we  saw his star in the east, and we came to bow to him.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_3" data-id="MT2_3">And Herod the king having heard, was stirred, and all  Jerusalem with him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_4" data-id="MT2_4">and having gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the  people, he was inquiring from them where the Christ is born.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_5" data-id="MT2_5">And they said to him, `In Beth-Lehem of Judea, for thus it  hath been written through the prophet,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_6" data-id="MT2_6">And thou, Beth-Lehem, the land of Judah, thou art by no  means the least among the leaders of Judah, for out of thee  shall come one leading, who shall feed My people Israel.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_7" data-id="MT2_7">Then Herod, privately having called the mages, did inquire  exactly from them the time of the appearing star,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_8" data-id="MT2_8">and having sent them to Beth-Lehem, he said, `Having gone --  inquire ye exactly for the child, and whenever ye may have  found, bring me back word, that I also having come may bow to  him.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_9" data-id="MT2_9">And they, having heard the king, departed, and lo, the star,  that they did see in the east, did go before them, till, having  come, it stood over where the child was.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_10" data-id="MT2_10">And having seen the star, they rejoiced with exceeding  great joy,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_11" data-id="MT2_11">and having come to the house, they found the child with  Mary his mother, and having fallen down they bowed to him, and  having opened their treasures, they presented to him gifts,  gold, and frankincense, and myrrh,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_12" data-id="MT2_12">and having been divinely warned in a dream not to turn back  unto Herod, through another way they withdrew to their own  region.</span>
