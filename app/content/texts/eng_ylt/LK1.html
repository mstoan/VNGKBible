<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_2" data-id="LK1_2">as they did deliver to us, who from the beginning became  eye-witnesses, and officers of the Word, --</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_3" data-id="LK1_3">it seemed good also to me, having followed from the first  after all things exactly, to write to thee in order, most noble  Theophilus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_4" data-id="LK1_4">that thou mayest know the certainty of the things wherein  thou wast instructed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_5" data-id="LK1_5">There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain  priest, by name Zacharias, of the course of Abijah, and his  wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name Elisabeth;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_6" data-id="LK1_6">and they were both righteous before God, going on in all the  commands and righteousnesses of the Lord blameless,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_7" data-id="LK1_7">and they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren,  and both were advanced in their days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_8" data-id="LK1_8">And it came to pass, in his acting as priest, in the order  of his course before God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_9" data-id="LK1_9">according to the custom of the priesthood, his lot was to  make perfume, having gone into the sanctuary of the Lord,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_10" data-id="LK1_10">and all the multitude of the people were praying without,  at the hour of the perfume.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_11" data-id="LK1_11">And there appeared to him a messenger of the Lord standing  on the right side of the altar of the perfume,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_12" data-id="LK1_12">and Zacharias, having seen, was troubled, and fear fell on  him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_13" data-id="LK1_13">and the messenger said unto him, `Fear not, Zacharias, for  thy supplication was heard, and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear  a son to thee, and thou shalt call his name John,</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_15" data-id="LK1_15">for he shall be great before the Lord, and wine and strong  drink he may not drink, and of the Holy Spirit he shall be  full, even from his mother's womb;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_16" data-id="LK1_16">and many of the sons of Israel he shall turn to the Lord  their God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_17" data-id="LK1_17">and he shall go before Him, in the spirit and power of  Elijah, to turn hearts of fathers unto children, and  disobedient ones to the wisdom of righteous ones, to make  ready for the Lord, a people prepared.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_18" data-id="LK1_18">And Zacharias said unto the messenger, `Whereby shall I  know this? for I am aged, and my wife is advanced in her  days?'</span>

<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_23" data-id="LK1_23">And it came to pass, when the days of his service were  fulfilled, he went away to his house,</span>

<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_28" data-id="LK1_28">And the messenger having come in unto her, said, `Hail,  favoured one, the Lord [is] with thee; blessed [art] thou  among women;'</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_29" data-id="LK1_29">and she, having seen, was troubled at his word, and was  reasoning of what kind this salutation may be.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_30" data-id="LK1_30">And the messenger said to her, `Fear not, Mary, for thou  hast found favour with God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_31" data-id="LK1_31">and lo, thou shalt conceive in the womb, and shalt bring  forth a son, and call his name Jesus;</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_32" data-id="LK1_32">he shall be great, and Son of the Highest he shall be  called, and the Lord God shall give him the throne of David  his father,</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_33" data-id="LK1_33">and he shall reign over the house of Jacob to the ages; and  of his reign there shall be no end.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_34" data-id="LK1_34">And Mary said unto the messenger, `How shall this be,  seeing a husband I do not know?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_35" data-id="LK1_35">And the messenger answering said to her, `The Holy Spirit  shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall  overshadow thee, therefore also the holy-begotten thing shall  be called Son of God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_36" data-id="LK1_36">and lo, Elisabeth, thy kinswoman, she also hath conceived a  son in her old age, and this is the sixth month to her who was  called barren;</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_37" data-id="LK1_37">because nothing shall be impossible with God.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_38" data-id="LK1_38">And Mary said, `Lo, the maid-servant of the Lord; let it be  to me according to thy saying,' and the messenger went away  from her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_39" data-id="LK1_39">And Mary having arisen in those days, went to the  hill-country, with haste, to a city of Judea,</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_40" data-id="LK1_40">and entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted  Elisabeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_41" data-id="LK1_41">And it came to pass, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of  Mary, the babe did leap in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled  with the Holy Spirit,</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_42" data-id="LK1_42">and spake out with a loud voice, and said, `Blessed [art]  thou among women, and blessed [is] the fruit of thy womb;</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_43" data-id="LK1_43">and whence [is] this to me, that the mother of my Lord  might come unto me?</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_44" data-id="LK1_44">for, lo, when the voice of thy salutation came to my ears,  leap in gladness did the babe in my womb;</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_45" data-id="LK1_45">and happy [is] she who did believe, for there shall be a  completion to the things spoken to her from the Lord.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_46" data-id="LK1_46">And Mary said, `My soul doth magnify the Lord,</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_47" data-id="LK1_47">And my spirit was glad on God my Saviour,</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_48" data-id="LK1_48">Because He looked on the lowliness of His maid-servant,  For, lo, henceforth call me happy shall all the generations,</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_49" data-id="LK1_49">For He who is mighty did to me great things, And holy [is]  His name,</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_50" data-id="LK1_50">And His kindness [is] to generations of generations, To  those fearing Him,</span>

<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_52" data-id="LK1_52">He brought down the mighty from thrones, And He exalted the  lowly,</span>

<span class="v-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_57" data-id="LK1_57">And to Elisabeth was the time fulfilled for her bringing  forth, and she bare a son,</span>
<span class="v-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_58" data-id="LK1_58">and the neighbours and her kindred heard that the Lord was  making His kindness great with her, and they were rejoicing  with her.</span>
