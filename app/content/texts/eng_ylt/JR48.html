<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_2" data-id="JR48_2">There is no more praise of Moab, In Heshbon they devised  against it evil: Come, and we cut it off from [being] a nation,  Also, O Madmen, thou art cut off, After thee goeth a sword.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_3" data-id="JR48_3">A voice of a cry [is] from Horonaim, Spoiling and great  destruction.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_7" data-id="JR48_7">For, because of thy trusting in thy works, And in thy  treasures, even thou art captured, And gone out hath Chemosh in  a removal, His priests and his heads together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_8" data-id="JR48_8">And come in doth a spoiler unto every city, And no city  doth escape, And perished hath the valley, And destroyed been  the plain, as Jehovah said.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_9" data-id="JR48_9">Give wings to Moab, for she utterly goeth out, And her  cities are for a desolation, Without an inhabitant in them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_10" data-id="JR48_10">Cursed [is] he who is doing the work of Jehovah  slothfully, And cursed [is] he Who is withholding his sword  from blood.</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_12" data-id="JR48_12">Therefore, lo, days are coming, An affirmation of Jehovah,  And I have sent to him wanderers, And they have caused him to  wander, And his vessels they empty out, And his bottles they  dash in pieces.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_13" data-id="JR48_13">And ashamed hath been Moab because of Chemosh, As the  house of Israel have been ashamed Because of Beth-El their  confidence.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_14" data-id="JR48_14">How do ye say, We [are] mighty, And men of strength for  battle?</span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_18" data-id="JR48_18">Come down from honour, sit in thirst, O inhabitant,  daughter of Dibon, For a spoiler of Moab hath come up to thee,  He hath destroyed thy fenced places.</span>

<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_26" data-id="JR48_26">Declare ye him drunk, For against Jehovah he made himself  great And Moab hath stricken in his vomit, And he hath been for  a derision -- even he.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_27" data-id="JR48_27">And was not Israel the derision to thee? Among thieves was  he found? For since thy words concerning him, Thou dost bemoan  thyself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_28" data-id="JR48_28">Forsake cities, and dwell in a rock, Ye inhabitants of  Moab, And be as a dove making a nest in the passages of a pit's  mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_29" data-id="JR48_29">We have heard of the arrogance of Moab, Exceeding proud!  His haughtiness, and his arrogance, And his pride, and the  height of his heart,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_30" data-id="JR48_30">I -- I have known, an affirmation of Jehovah, His wrath,  and [it is] not right, His devices -- not right they have done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_31" data-id="JR48_31">Therefore for Moab I howl, even for Moab -- all of it, I  cry for men of Kir-Heres, it doth mourn,</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_32" data-id="JR48_32">With the weeping of Jazer, I weep for thee, O vine of  Sibmah, Thy branches have passed over a sea, Unto the sea of  Jazer they have come, On thy summer fruits, and on thy harvest,  A spoiler hath fallen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_33" data-id="JR48_33">And removed hath been joy and gladness From the fruitful  field, Even from the land of Moab, And wine from wine-presses I  have caused to cease, Shouting doth not proceed, The shouting  [is] no shouting!</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_34" data-id="JR48_34">Because of the cry of Heshbon unto Elealeh, Unto Jahaz  they have given their voice, From Zoar unto Horonaim, A heifer  of the third [year], For even waters of Nimrim become  desolations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_35" data-id="JR48_35">And I have caused to cease to Moab, An affirmation of  Jehovah, Him who is offering in a high place, And him who is  making perfume to his god.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_36" data-id="JR48_36">Therefore my heart for Moab as pipes doth sound, And my  heart for men of Kir-Heres As pipes doth sound, Therefore the  abundance he made did perish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_37" data-id="JR48_37">For every head [is] bald, and every beard diminished, On  all hands cuttings, and on the loins -- sackcloth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_38" data-id="JR48_38">On all roofs of Moab, and in her broad-places, All of it  -- [is] lamentation, For I have broken Moab as a vessel in  which there is no pleasure, An affirmation of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_39" data-id="JR48_39">How hath it been broken down! they have howled, How hath  Moab turned the neck ashamed, And Moab hath been for a  derision. And for a terror to all round about her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_40" data-id="JR48_40">For thus said Jehovah: Lo, as an eagle he doth flee, And  hath spread his wings unto Moab.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_41" data-id="JR48_41">Captured have been the cities, And the strongholds are  caught, And the heart of the mighty of Moab Hath been in that  day as the heart of a distressed woman.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_42" data-id="JR48_42">And Moab hath been destroyed from [being] a people, For  against Jehovah he exerted himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_43" data-id="JR48_43">Fear, and a snare, and a gin, [are] for thee, O inhabitant  of Moab -- an affirmation of Jehovah,</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_44" data-id="JR48_44">Whoso is fleeing because of the fear falleth into the  snare, And whoso is coming up from the snare is captured by the  gin, For I bring in unto her -- unto Moab -- The year of their  inspection, An affirmation of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_45" data-id="JR48_45">In the shadow of Heshbon stood powerless have fugitives,  For fire hath gone forth from Heshbon, And a flame from within  Sihon, And it consumeth the corner of Moab, And the crown of  the sons of Shaon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_46" data-id="JR48_46">Wo to thee, O Moab, Perished hath the people of Chemosh,  For thy sons were taken with the captives, And thy daughters  with the captivity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR48_47" data-id="JR48_47">And I have turned back [to] the captivity of Moab, In the  latter end of the days, An affirmation of Jehovah! Hitherto  [is] the judgment of Moab.</span>
