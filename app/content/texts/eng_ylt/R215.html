<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R215_3" data-id="R215_3">and many days [are] to Israel without a true God, and  without a teaching priest, and without law,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R215_4" data-id="R215_4">and it turneth back in its distress unto Jehovah, God of  Israel, and they seek Him, and He is found of them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R215_5" data-id="R215_5">and in those times there is no peace to him who is going  out, and to him who is coming in, for many troubles [are] on  all the inhabitants of the lands,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R215_6" data-id="R215_6">and they have been beaten down, nation by nation, and city  by city, for God hath troubled them with every adversity;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R215_7" data-id="R215_7">and ye, be ye strong, and let not your hands be feeble, for  there is a reward for your work.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v R215_9" data-id="R215_9">and gathereth all Judah and Benjamin, and the sojourners  with them out of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and out of Simeon --  for they have fallen unto him from Israel in abundance, in  their seeing that Jehovah his God [is] with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v R215_10" data-id="R215_10">And they are gathered to Jerusalem in the third month of  the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa,</span>
