<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_2" data-id="HB10_2">Or else wouldn’t they have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins? </span>

<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_30" data-id="HB10_30">For we know him who said, “Vengeance belongs to me,” says the Lord, “I will repay.”<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Deuteronomy 32:35</span></span> Again, “The Lord will judge his people.”<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Deuteronomy 32:36; Psalm 135:14</span></span> </span>
