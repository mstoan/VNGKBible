<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_1" data-id="JN5_1">After these things, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_2" data-id="JN5_2">Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there is a pool, which is called in Hebrew, “Bethesda”, having five porches.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_3" data-id="JN5_3">In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_4" data-id="JN5_4">for an angel went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water. Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease he had.<span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_5" data-id="JN5_5">A certain man was there, who had been sick for thirty-eight years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_6" data-id="JN5_6">When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he asked him, <span class="wj woj">“Do you want to be made well?”</span> </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_7" data-id="JN5_7">The sick man answered him, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I’m coming, another steps down before me.” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_8" data-id="JN5_8">Jesus said to him, <span class="wj woj">“Arise, take up your mat, and walk.”</span></span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_9" data-id="JN5_9">Immediately, the man was made well, and took up his mat and walked.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v JN5_9" data-id="JN5_9">Now it was the Sabbath on that day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_10" data-id="JN5_10">So the Jews said to him who was cured, “It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry the mat.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_11" data-id="JN5_11">He answered them, “He who made me well, the same said to me, <span class="wj woj">‘Take up your mat, and walk.’</span>” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_12" data-id="JN5_12">Then they asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, <span class="wj woj">‘Take up your mat, and walk’</span>?” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_13" data-id="JN5_13">But he who was healed didn’t know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a crowd being in the place.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_14" data-id="JN5_14">Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, <span class="wj woj">“Behold, you are made well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse happens to you.” </span> </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_15" data-id="JN5_15">The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_16" data-id="JN5_16">For this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these things on the Sabbath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_17" data-id="JN5_17">But Jesus answered them, <span class="wj woj">“My Father is still working, so I am working, too.”</span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_18" data-id="JN5_18">For this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_19" data-id="JN5_19">Jesus therefore answered them, <span class="wj woj">“Most certainly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things he does, these the Son also does likewise. </span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_20" data-id="JN5_20"> <span class="wj woj">For the Father has affection for the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. He will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel. </span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_21" data-id="JN5_21"> <span class="wj woj">For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires. </span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_22" data-id="JN5_22"> <span class="wj woj">For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son, </span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_23" data-id="JN5_23"> <span class="wj woj">that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who doesn’t honor the Son doesn’t honor the Father who sent him.</span> </span>

<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_24" data-id="JN5_24"> <span class="wj woj">“Most certainly I tell you, he who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and doesn’t come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life. </span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_25" data-id="JN5_25"> <span class="wj woj">Most certainly, I tell you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the Son of God’s voice; and those who hear will live. </span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_26" data-id="JN5_26"> <span class="wj woj">For as the Father has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself. </span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_27" data-id="JN5_27"> <span class="wj woj">He also gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man. </span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_28" data-id="JN5_28"> <span class="wj woj">Don’t marvel at this, for the hour comes, in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice, </span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_29" data-id="JN5_29"> <span class="wj woj">and will come out; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment. </span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN5_30" data-id="JN5_30"> <span class="wj woj">I can of myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous; because I don’t seek my own will, but the will of my Father who sent me.</span> </span>
