<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_1" data-id="BR2_1">Therefore the Lord has made good his word, which he pronounced against us, and against our judges that judged Israel, and against our kings, and against our princes, and against the men of Israel and Judah,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_2" data-id="BR2_2">to bring upon us great plagues, such as never happened under the whole heaven, <span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2"></a></span><span class="note" id="note-3"><a class="key" href="#footnote-3">Another</a></span><span class="note" id="note-4"><a class="key" href="#footnote-4">even</a></span> as it came to pass in Jerusalem, according to the things that are written in the law of Moses; </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_3" data-id="BR2_3">That we should eat every man the flesh of his own son, and every man the flesh of his own daughter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_4" data-id="BR2_4">Moreover he has given them to be in subjection to all the kingdoms that are round about us, to be a reproach and a desolation among all the people round about, where the Lord has scattered them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_5" data-id="BR2_5">Thus were they cast down, and not exalted, because we sinned against the Lord our God, in not hearkening to his voice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_6" data-id="BR2_6">To the Lord our God <span class="add">belongs </span> righteousness: but to us and to our fathers confusion of face, as at this day.</span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_8" data-id="BR2_8">Yet have we not entreated the favor of the Lord, in turning every one from the thoughts of his wicked heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_9" data-id="BR2_9">Therefore has the Lord kept watch over the plagues, and the Lord has brought <span class="add">them </span> upon us; for the Lord is righteous in all his works which he has commanded us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_10" data-id="BR2_10">Yet we have not hearkened to his voice, to walk in the commandments of the Lord that he has set before us.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_11" data-id="BR2_11">And now, O Lord, you God of Israel, that have brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with signs, and with wonders, and with great power, and with a high arm, and have gotten yourself a name, as at this day:</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_12" data-id="BR2_12">O Lord our God, we have sinned, we have done ungodly, we have dealt unrighteously in all your ordinances.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_13" data-id="BR2_13">Let your wrath turn from us: for we are but a few left among the heathen, where you have scattered us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_14" data-id="BR2_14">Hear our prayer, O Lord, and our petition, and deliver us for your own sake, and give us favor in the sight of them which have led us away captive: </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_15" data-id="BR2_15">that all the earth may know that you are the Lord our God, because Israel and his posterity is called by your name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_16" data-id="BR2_16">O Lord, look down from your holy house, and consider us: incline your ear, O Lord, and hear:</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_17" data-id="BR2_17">open your eyes, and behold: for the dead that are in <span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2"></a></span><span class="note" id="note-3"><a class="key" href="#footnote-3"></a></span><span class="note" id="note-4"><a class="key" href="#footnote-4"></a></span> the grave, whose breath is taken from their bodies, will give to the Lord neither glory nor righteousness: </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_18" data-id="BR2_18">but the soul that is greatly vexed, which goes stooping and feeble, and the eyes that fail, and the hungry soul, will give you glory and righteousness, O Lord. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_19" data-id="BR2_19">For we do not present our supplication before you, O Lord our God, for the righteousness of our fathers, and of our kings. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_20" data-id="BR2_20">For you have sent your wrath and your indignation upon us, as you have spoken by your servants the prophets, <span class="add">saying, </span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_21" data-id="BR2_21">Thus says the Lord, Bow your shoulders to serve the king of Babylon, and remain in the land that I gave to your fathers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_22" data-id="BR2_22">But if you⌃ will not hear the voice of the Lord, to serve the king of Babylon,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_23" data-id="BR2_23">I will cause to cease out of the cities of Judah, and from without Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: and the whole land shall be desolate without inhabitant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_24" data-id="BR2_24">But we would not hearken to your voice, to serve the king of Babylon: therefore have you made good your words that you spoke by your servants the prophets, <span class="add">namely, </span> that the bones of our kings, and the bones of our fathers, should be taken out of their places. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_25" data-id="BR2_25">And, behold, they are cast out to the heat by day, and to the frost by night, and they died in great miseries by famine, by sword, and by <span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2"></a></span><span class="note" id="note-3"><a class="key" href="#footnote-3">See</a></span> pestilence. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_26" data-id="BR2_26">And the house which is called by your name have you laid <span class="add">waste, </span> as at this day, for the wickedness of the house of Israel and the house of Judah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_27" data-id="BR2_27">Yet, O Lord our God, you have dealt with us after all your kindness, and according to all that great mercy of your,</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_28" data-id="BR2_28">as you spoke by your servant Moses in the day when you did command him to write your law before the children of Israel, saying, </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_29" data-id="BR2_29">If you⌃ will not hear my voice, surely this very great multitude shall be turned into a small <span class="add">number </span> among the nations, where I will scatter them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_30" data-id="BR2_30">For I know that they will not hear me, because it is a stiff-necked people: but in the land of their captivity they shall lay it to heart, </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_31" data-id="BR2_31">and shall know that I am the Lord their God: and I will give them a heart, and ears to hear:</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_32" data-id="BR2_32">and they shall praise me in the land of their captivity, and think upon my name,</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_33" data-id="BR2_33">and shall return from their stiff neck, and from their wicked deeds: for they shall remember the way of their fathers, which sinned before the Lord. </span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_34" data-id="BR2_34">And I will bring them again into the land which I sware to their fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and they shall be lords of it: and I will increase them, and they shall not be diminished.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v BR2_35" data-id="BR2_35">And I will make an everlasting covenant with them to be their God, and they shall be my people: and I will no more remove my people of Israel out of the land that I have given them. </span>
