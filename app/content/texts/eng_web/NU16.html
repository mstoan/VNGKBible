<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_2" data-id="NU16_2">They rose up before Moses, with some of the children of Israel, two hundred fifty princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_3" data-id="NU16_3">They assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, “You take too much on yourself, since all the congregation are holy, everyone of them, and Yahweh is among them! Why do you lift yourselves up above Yahweh’s assembly?” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_4" data-id="NU16_4">When Moses heard it, he fell on his face.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_5" data-id="NU16_5">He said to Korah and to all his company, “In the morning, Yahweh will show who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near to him. Even him whom he shall choose, he will cause to come near to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_6" data-id="NU16_6">Do this: take censers, Korah, and all his company;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_7" data-id="NU16_7">and put fire in them, and put incense on them before Yahweh tomorrow. It shall be that the man whom Yahweh chooses, he shall be holy. You have gone too far, you sons of Levi!” </span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_8" data-id="NU16_8">Moses said to Korah, “Hear now, you sons of Levi!</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_9" data-id="NU16_9">Is it a small thing to you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of Yahweh’s tabernacle, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_10" data-id="NU16_10">and that he has brought you near, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you? Do you seek the priesthood also?</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_11" data-id="NU16_11">Therefore you and all your company have gathered together against Yahweh! What is Aaron that you murmur against him?”</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_14" data-id="NU16_14">Moreover you haven’t brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We won’t come up.”</span>

<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_26" data-id="NU16_26">He spoke to the congregation, saying, “Depart, please, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins!” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_27" data-id="NU16_27">So they went away from the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side. Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, with their wives, their sons, and their little ones.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_28" data-id="NU16_28">Moses said, “Hereby you shall know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these works; for they are not from my own mind.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_29" data-id="NU16_29">If these men die the common death of all men, or if they experience what all men experience, then Yahweh hasn’t sent me.</span>

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_31" data-id="NU16_31">As he finished speaking all these words, the ground that was under them split apart.</span>

<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_33" data-id="NU16_33">So they, and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol. <span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> The earth closed on them, and they perished from among the assembly.</span>

<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_38" data-id="NU16_38">even the censers of these sinners against their own lives.

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_39" data-id="NU16_39">Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burned had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar, </span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_40" data-id="NU16_40">to be a memorial to the children of Israel, to the end that no stranger, who isn’t of the offspring<span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> of Aaron, would come near to burn incense before Yahweh, that he not be as Korah, and as his company; as Yahweh spoke to him by Moses. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_41" data-id="NU16_41">But on the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, “You have killed Yahweh’s people!” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_42" data-id="NU16_42">When the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, They looked toward the Tent of Meeting. Behold, the cloud covered it, and Yahweh’s glory appeared. </span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_43" data-id="NU16_43">Moses and Aaron came to the front of the Tent of Meeting.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_44" data-id="NU16_44">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_45" data-id="NU16_45">“Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!” They fell on their faces.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_46" data-id="NU16_46">Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer, and put fire from off the altar in it, and lay incense on it, and carry it quickly to the congregation, and make atonement for them; for wrath has gone out from Yahweh!

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_47" data-id="NU16_47">Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the middle of the assembly. Behold, the plague has begun among the people. He put on the incense, and made atonement for the people. </span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_48" data-id="NU16_48">He stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.</span>
