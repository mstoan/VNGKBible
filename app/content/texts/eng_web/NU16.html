<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_2" data-id="NU16_2">They rose up before Moses, with some of the children of Israel, two hundred fifty princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_3" data-id="NU16_3">They assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, “You take too much on yourself, since all the congregation are holy, everyone of them, and Yahweh is among them! Why do you lift yourselves up above Yahweh’s assembly?” </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_4" data-id="NU16_4">When Moses heard it, he fell on his face.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_5" data-id="NU16_5">He said to Korah and to all his company, “In the morning, Yahweh will show who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near to him. Even him whom he shall choose, he will cause to come near to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_6" data-id="NU16_6">Do this: take censers, Korah, and all his company;</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_9" data-id="NU16_9">Is it a small thing to you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of Yahweh’s tabernacle, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_10" data-id="NU16_10">and that he has brought you near, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you? Do you seek the priesthood also?</span>

<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_26" data-id="NU16_26">He spoke to the congregation, saying, “Depart, please, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins!” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_27" data-id="NU16_27">So they went away from the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side. Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, with their wives, their sons, and their little ones.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_28" data-id="NU16_28">Moses said, “Hereby you shall know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these works; for they are not from my own mind.</span>

<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_33" data-id="NU16_33">So they, and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol. <span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> The earth closed on them, and they perished from among the assembly.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_47" data-id="NU16_47">Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the middle of the assembly. Behold, the plague has begun among the people. He put on the incense, and made atonement for the people. </span>
