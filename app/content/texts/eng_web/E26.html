<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v E26_42" data-id="E26_42">Upon the third day you did command that the waters should be gathered together in the seventh part of the earth: six parts did you dry up, and keep them, to the intent that of these some being both planted and tilled might serve before you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v E26_43" data-id="E26_43">For as soom as your word went forth the work was done.</span>

<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v E26_48" data-id="E26_48">that the dumb water and without life brought forth living things as it was bidden, that the peoples might therefore praise your wondrous works. </span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v E26_49" data-id="E26_49">Then did you preserve two living creatures, the one you calledst Behemoth, and the other you calledst Leviathan:</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v E26_50" data-id="E26_50">and you did separate the one from the other: for the seventh part, namely, where the water was gathered together, might not hold them both. </span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v E26_51" data-id="E26_51">To Behemoth you gave one part, which was dried up on the third day, that he should dwell in the same, wherein are a thousand hills: </span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v E26_52" data-id="E26_52">but to Leviathan you gave the seventh part, namely, the moist; and you have kept them to be devoured of whom you will, and when. </span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v E26_53" data-id="E26_53">But upon the sixth day you gave commandment to the earth, that it should bring forth before you cattle, beasts, and creeping things: </span>
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v E26_54" data-id="E26_54">and over these Adam, whom you ordain lord over all the works that you have made: of him come we all, the people whom you have chosen. </span>
<span class="v-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v E26_55" data-id="E26_55">All this have I spoken before you, O Lord, because you have said that for our sakes you made <span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2"></a></span><span class="note" id="note-3"><a class="key" href="#footnote-3">So</a></span><span class="note" id="note-4"><a class="key" href="#footnote-4">the</a></span> this world. </span>
<span class="v-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v E26_56" data-id="E26_56">As for the other nations, which also come of Adam, you have said that they are nothing, and are like to spittle: and you have likened the abundance of them to a drop that falls from a vessel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v E26_57" data-id="E26_57">And now, O Lord, behold these nations, which are reputed as nothing, be lords over us, and devour us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span><span class="v E26_58" data-id="E26_58">But we your people, whom you have called your firstborn, your only begotten, and your fervent lover, are given into their hands. </span>
<span class="v-num v-59">59&nbsp;</span><span class="v E26_59" data-id="E26_59">If the world now be made for our sakes, why do we not possess for an inheritance our world? How long shall this endure?</span>
