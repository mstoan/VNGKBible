<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_2" data-id="GN20_2">Abraham said about Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_3" data-id="GN20_3">But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken. For she is a man’s wife.” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_4" data-id="GN20_4">Now Abimelech had not come near her. He said, “Lord, will you kill even a righteous nation?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_5" data-id="GN20_5">Didn’t he tell me, ‘She is my sister?’ She, even she herself, said, ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.” </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_6" data-id="GN20_6">God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore I didn’t allow you to touch her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_7" data-id="GN20_7">Now therefore, restore the man’s wife. For he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. If you don’t restore her, know for sure that you will die, you, and all who are yours.”</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_9" data-id="GN20_9">Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, “What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done!”</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_10" data-id="GN20_10">Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you see, that you have done this thing?”</span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_11" data-id="GN20_11">Abraham said, “Because I thought, ‘Surely the fear of God is not in this place. They will kill me for my wife’s sake.’</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_12" data-id="GN20_12">Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_13" data-id="GN20_13">When God caused me to wander from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘This is your kindness which you shall show to me. Everywhere that we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’” </span>
