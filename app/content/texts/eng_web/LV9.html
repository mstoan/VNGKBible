<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_2" data-id="LV9_2">and he said to Aaron, “Take a calf from the herd for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without defect, and offer them before Yahweh. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_3" data-id="LV9_3">You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without defect, for a burnt offering; </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_4" data-id="LV9_4">and a bull and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before Yahweh; and a meal offering mixed with oil: for today Yahweh appears to you.’” </span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_18" data-id="LV9_18">He also killed the bull and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron’s sons delivered to him the blood, which he sprinkled around on the altar,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_19" data-id="LV9_19">and the fat of the bull and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covers the innards, and the kidneys, and the cover of the liver: </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_20" data-id="LV9_20">and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burned the fat on the altar:</span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_22" data-id="LV9_22">Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings. </span>
