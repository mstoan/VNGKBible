<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT10_2" data-id="DT10_2">I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.”</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT10_3" data-id="DT10_3">So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two stone tablets like the first, and went up onto the mountain, having the two tablets in my hand. </span>

<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT10_6" data-id="DT10_6">(The children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his place. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT10_7" data-id="DT10_7">From there they traveled to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT10_8" data-id="DT10_8">At that time Yahweh set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, to stand before Yahweh to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT10_9" data-id="DT10_9">Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brothers; Yahweh is his inheritance, according as Yahweh your God spoke to him.) </span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT10_11" data-id="DT10_11">Yahweh said to me, “Arise, take your journey before the people; and they shall go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give to them.” </span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT10_16" data-id="DT10_16">Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT10_17" data-id="DT10_17">For Yahweh your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the awesome, who doesn’t respect persons, nor takes reward. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT10_18" data-id="DT10_18">He does execute justice for the fatherless and widow, and loves the foreigner, in giving him food and clothing.</span>
