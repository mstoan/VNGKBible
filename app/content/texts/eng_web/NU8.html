<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU8_7" data-id="NU8_7">You shall do this to them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of cleansing on them, let them shave their whole bodies with a razor, and let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU8_8" data-id="NU8_8">Then let them take a young bull, and its meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil; and another young bull you shall take for a sin offering. </span>
