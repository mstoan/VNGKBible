<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS36_2" data-id="IS36_2">The king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to king Hezekiah with a large army. He stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool in the fuller’s field highway. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS36_3" data-id="IS36_3">Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder came out to him. </span>

<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS36_5" data-id="IS36_5">I say that your counsel and strength for the war are only vain words. Now in whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me? </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS36_6" data-id="IS36_6">Behold, you trust in the staff of this bruised reed, even in Egypt, which if a man leans on it, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS36_7" data-id="IS36_7">But if you tell me, ‘We trust in Yahweh our God,’ isn’t that he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, ‘You shall worship before this altar?’”</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS36_8" data-id="IS36_8">Now therefore, please make a pledge to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them. </span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS36_16" data-id="IS36_16">Don’t listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria, ‘Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and each of you eat from his vine, and each one from his fig tree, and each one of you drink the waters of his own cistern;</span>
