<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_3" data-id="T11_3">As I urged you when I was going into Macedonia, stay at Ephesus that you might command certain men not to teach a different doctrine, </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_4" data-id="T11_4">and not to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause disputes, rather than God’s stewardship, which is in faith— </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_5" data-id="T11_5">but the goal of this command is love, out of a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith;</span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_8" data-id="T11_8">But we know that the law is good, if a person uses it lawfully,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_9" data-id="T11_9">as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_14" data-id="T11_14">The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</span>
