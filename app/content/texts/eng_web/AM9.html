<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_1" data-id="AM9_1">I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and he said, “Strike the tops of the pillars, that the thresholds may shake; and break them in pieces on the head of all of them; and I will kill the last of them with the sword: there shall not one of them flee away, and there shall not one of them escape. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_2" data-id="AM9_2">Though they dig into Sheol,<span class="note" id="note-1"><a class="key" href="#footnote-1">+</a></span> there my hand will take them; and though they climb up to heaven, there I will bring them down. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_3" data-id="AM9_3">Though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out there; and though they be hidden from my sight in the bottom of the sea, there I will command the serpent, and it will bite them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_4" data-id="AM9_4">Though they go into captivity before their enemies, there I will command the sword, and it will kill them. I will set my eyes on them for evil, and not for good. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_5" data-id="AM9_5">For the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, is he who touches the land and it melts, and all who dwell in it will mourn; and it will rise up wholly like the River, and will sink again, like the River of Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_6" data-id="AM9_6">It is he who builds his rooms in the heavens, and has founded his vault on the earth; he who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the surface of the earth; Yahweh is his name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_7" data-id="AM9_7">Are you not like the children of the Ethiopians to me, children of Israel?” says Yahweh. “Haven’t I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_8" data-id="AM9_8">Behold, the eyes of the Lord Yahweh are on the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the surface of the earth; except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,” says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_9" data-id="AM9_9">“For, behold, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations, as grain is sifted in a sieve, yet not the least kernel will fall on the earth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_10" data-id="AM9_10">All the sinners of my people will die by the sword, who say, ‘Evil won’t overtake nor meet us.’</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_11" data-id="AM9_11">In that day I will raise up the tent of David who is fallen, and close up its breaches, and I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old; </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_12" data-id="AM9_12">that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations who are called by my name,” says Yahweh who does this.</span>
