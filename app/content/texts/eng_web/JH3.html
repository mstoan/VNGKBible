<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH3_7" data-id="JH3_7">He made a proclamation and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, “Let neither man nor animal, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, nor drink water;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH3_8" data-id="JH3_8">but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and animal, and let them cry mightily to God. Yes, let them turn everyone from his evil way, and from the violence that is in his hands. </span>
