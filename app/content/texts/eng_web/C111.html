<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_1" data-id="C111_1">Be imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_2" data-id="C111_2">Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and hold firm the traditions, even as I delivered them to you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_3" data-id="C111_3">But I would have you know that the head<span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> of every man is Christ, and the head<span class="note" id="note-3"><a class="key" href="#footnote-3">+</a></span> of the woman is man, and the head<span class="note" id="note-4"><a class="key" href="#footnote-4">+</a></span> of Christ is God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_4" data-id="C111_4">Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_5" data-id="C111_5">But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered dishonors her head. For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_6" data-id="C111_6">For if a woman is not covered, let her hair also be cut off. But if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or be shaved, let her be covered. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_7" data-id="C111_7">For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_8" data-id="C111_8">For man is not from woman, but woman from man;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_9" data-id="C111_9">for man wasn’t created for the woman, but woman for the man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_10" data-id="C111_10">For this cause the woman ought to have authority over her own head, because of the angels.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_11" data-id="C111_11">Nevertheless, neither is the woman independent of the man, nor the man independent of the woman, in the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_12" data-id="C111_12">For as woman came from man, so a man also comes through a woman; but all things are from God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_13" data-id="C111_13">Judge for yourselves. Is it appropriate that a woman pray to God unveiled?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_14" data-id="C111_14">Doesn’t even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_15" data-id="C111_15">But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given to her for a covering.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_16" data-id="C111_16">But if any man seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither do God’s assemblies.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_17" data-id="C111_17">But in giving you this command, I don’t praise you, that you come together not for the better but for the worse.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_18" data-id="C111_18">For first of all, when you come together in the assembly, I hear that divisions exist among you, and I partly believe it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_19" data-id="C111_19">For there also must be factions among you, that those who are approved may be revealed among you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_20" data-id="C111_20">When therefore you assemble yourselves together, it is not the Lord’s supper that you eat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_21" data-id="C111_21">For in your eating each one takes his own supper first. One is hungry, and another is drunken.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_22" data-id="C111_22">What, don’t you have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you despise God’s assembly, and put them to shame who don’t have? What shall I tell you? Shall I praise you? In this I don’t praise you.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_23" data-id="C111_23">For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_24" data-id="C111_24">When he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, <span class="wj woj">“Take, eat. This is my body, which is broken for you. Do this in memory of me.”</span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_25" data-id="C111_25">In the same way he also took the cup, after supper, saying, <span class="wj woj">“This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink, in memory of me.”</span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_26" data-id="C111_26">For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_27" data-id="C111_27">Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord’s cup in a way unworthy of the Lord will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_28" data-id="C111_28">But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_29" data-id="C111_29">For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy way eats and drinks judgment to himself, if he doesn’t discern the Lord’s body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_30" data-id="C111_30">For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_31" data-id="C111_31">For if we discerned ourselves, we wouldn’t be judged.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_32" data-id="C111_32">But when we are judged, we are punished by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_33" data-id="C111_33">Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_34" data-id="C111_34">But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest your coming together be for judgment. The rest I will set in order whenever I come. </span>
