<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_6" data-id="AC22_6">As I made my journey, and came close to Damascus, about noon, suddenly a great light shone around me from the sky.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_7" data-id="AC22_7">I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, <span class="wj woj">‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’</span> </span>

<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_25" data-id="AC22_25">When they had tied him up with thongs, Paul asked the centurion who stood by, “Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and not found guilty?” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_26" data-id="AC22_26">When the centurion heard it, he went to the commanding officer and told him, “Watch what you are about to do, for this man is a Roman!” </span>

<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_29" data-id="AC22_29">Immediately those who were about to examine him departed from him, and the commanding officer also was afraid when he realized that he was a Roman, because he had bound him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_30" data-id="AC22_30">But on the next day, desiring to know the truth about why he was accused by the Jews, he freed him from the bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come together, and brought Paul down and set him before them.</span>
