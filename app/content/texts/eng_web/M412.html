<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v M412_1" data-id="M412_1">When he, too, had undergone blessed martyrdom, and died in the caldron into which he had been thrown, the seventh, the youngest of all, came forward: </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v M412_2" data-id="M412_2">whom the tyrant pitying, though he had been dreadfully reproached by his brethren,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v M412_3" data-id="M412_3">seeing him already encompassed with chains, had him brought nearer, and endeavoured to counsel him, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v M412_4" data-id="M412_4">You see the end of the madness of your brethren: for they have died in torture through disobedience; and you, if disobedient, having been miserably tormented, will yourself perish prematurely.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v M412_5" data-id="M412_5">But if you obey, you shall be my friend, and have a charge over the affairs of the kingdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v M412_6" data-id="M412_6">And having thus exhorted him, he sent for the mother of the boy; that, by condoling with her for the loss of so many sons, he might incline her, through the hope of safety, to render the survivor obedient.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v M412_7" data-id="M412_7">And he, after his mother had urged him on in the Hebrew tongue, (as we shall soon relate) says,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v M412_8" data-id="M412_8">Release me that I may speak to the king and all his friends.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v M412_9" data-id="M412_9">And they, rejoicing exceedingly at the promise of the youth, quickly let him go.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v M412_10" data-id="M412_10">And he, running up to the pans, said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v M412_11" data-id="M412_11">Impious tyrant, and most blasphemous man, were you not ashamed, having received prosperity and a kingdom from God, to kill His servants, and to rack the doers of godliness? </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v M412_12" data-id="M412_12">Wherefore the divine vengeance is reserving you for eternal fire and torments, which shall cling to you for all time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v M412_13" data-id="M412_13">Were you not ashamed, man as you are, yet most savage, to cut out the tongues of men of like feeling and origin, and having thus abused to torture them? </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v M412_14" data-id="M412_14">But they, bravely dying, fulfilled their religion towards God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v M412_15" data-id="M412_15">But you shall groan according to your deserts for having slain without cause the champions of virtue.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v M412_16" data-id="M412_16">Wherefore, he continued, I myself, being about to die,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v M412_17" data-id="M412_17">will not forsake my brethren.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v M412_18" data-id="M412_18">And I call upon the God of my fathers to be merciful to my race.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v M412_19" data-id="M412_19">But you, both living and dead, he will punish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v M412_20" data-id="M412_20">Thus having prayed, he hurled himself into the pans; and so expired.</span>
