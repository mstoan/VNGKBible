<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_1" data-id="C15_1">It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles, that one has his father’s wife. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_2" data-id="C15_2">You are puffed up, and didn’t rather mourn, that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_3" data-id="C15_3">For I most certainly, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him who has done this thing. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_4" data-id="C15_4">In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_7" data-id="C15_7">Purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed in our place. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_8" data-id="C15_8">Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_9" data-id="C15_9">I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners;</span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_11" data-id="C15_11">But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortionist. Don’t even eat with such a person.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_12" data-id="C15_12">For what do I have to do with also judging those who are outside? Don’t you judge those who are within?</span>
