<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_2" data-id="MK9_2">After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves, and he was changed into another form in front of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_3" data-id="MK9_3">His clothing became glistening, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth can whiten them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_4" data-id="MK9_4">Elijah and Moses appeared to them, and they were talking with Jesus.</span>

<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_6" data-id="MK9_6">For he didn’t know what to say, for they were very afraid.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_7" data-id="MK9_7">A cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him.”</span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_10" data-id="MK9_10">They kept this saying to themselves, questioning what the “rising from the dead” meant.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_11" data-id="MK9_11">They asked him, saying, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_12" data-id="MK9_12">He said to them, <span class="wj woj">“Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things. How is it written about the Son of Man, that he should suffer many things and be despised? </span> </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_26" data-id="MK9_26">Having cried out, and convulsed greatly, it came out of him. The boy became like one dead; so much that most of them said, “He is dead.” </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_27" data-id="MK9_27">But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_28" data-id="MK9_28">When he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we cast it out?”</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_29" data-id="MK9_29">He said to them, <span class="wj woj">“This kind can come out by nothing, except by prayer and fasting.”</span> </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_30" data-id="MK9_30">They went out from there, and passed through Galilee. He didn’t want anyone to know it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_31" data-id="MK9_31">For he was teaching his disciples, and said to them, <span class="wj woj">“The Son of Man is being handed over to the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, on the third day he will rise again.”</span> </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_32" data-id="MK9_32">But they didn’t understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_33" data-id="MK9_33">He came to Capernaum, and when he was in the house he asked them, <span class="wj woj">“What were you arguing among yourselves on the way?”</span> </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_34" data-id="MK9_34">But they were silent, for they had disputed one with another on the way about who was the greatest.</span>
