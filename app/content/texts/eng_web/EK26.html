<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK26_2" data-id="EK26_2">Son of man, because Tyre has said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken: the gate of the peoples; she is turned to me; I shall be replenished, now that she is laid waste: </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK26_3" data-id="EK26_3">therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, Behold, I am against you, Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against you, as the sea causes its waves to come up. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK26_4" data-id="EK26_4">They shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her a bare rock. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK26_5" data-id="EK26_5">She shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the middle of the sea; for I have spoken it, says the Lord Yahweh; and she shall become a plunder to the nations. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK26_6" data-id="EK26_6">Her daughters who are in the field shall be slain with the sword: and they shall know that I am Yahweh.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK26_7" data-id="EK26_7">For thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I will bring on Tyre Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and a company, and many people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK26_8" data-id="EK26_8">He shall kill your daughters in the field with the sword; and he shall make forts against you, and cast up a mound against you, and raise up the buckler against you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK26_9" data-id="EK26_9">He shall set his battering engines against your walls, and with his axes he shall break down your towers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK26_10" data-id="EK26_10">By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover you: your walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wagons, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into your gates, as men enter into a city in which is made a breach. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK26_11" data-id="EK26_11">With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all your streets; he shall kill your people with the sword; and the pillars of your strength shall go down to the ground. </span>

<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK26_20" data-id="EK26_20">then I will bring you down with those who descend into the pit, to the people of old time, and will make you to dwell in the lower parts of the earth, in the places that are desolate of old, with those who go down to the pit, that you be not inhabited; and I will set glory in the land of the living: </span>
