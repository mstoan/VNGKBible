<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK34_3" data-id="EK34_3">You eat the fat, and you clothe yourself with the wool, you kill the fatlings; but you don’t feed the sheep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK34_4" data-id="EK34_4">You haven’t strengthened the diseased, neither have you healed that which was sick, neither have you bound up that which was broken, neither have you brought back that which was driven away, neither have you sought that which was lost; but with force and with rigor you have ruled over them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK34_5" data-id="EK34_5">They were scattered, because there was no shepherd; and they became food to all the animals of the field, and were scattered. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK34_6" data-id="EK34_6">My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and on every high hill: yes, my sheep were scattered on all the surface of the earth; and there was no one who searched or sought. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK34_7" data-id="EK34_7">Therefore, you shepherds, hear Yahweh’s word:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK34_8" data-id="EK34_8">As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, surely because my sheep became a prey, and my sheep became food to all the animals of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my sheep, but the shepherds fed themselves, and didn’t feed my sheep; </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK34_9" data-id="EK34_9">therefore, you shepherds, hear Yahweh’s word:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK34_10" data-id="EK34_10">Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my sheep at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the sheep; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; and I will deliver my sheep from their mouth, that they may not be food for them. </span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK34_13" data-id="EK34_13">I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited places of the country.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK34_14" data-id="EK34_14">I will feed them with good pasture; and on the mountains of the height of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie down in a good fold; and on fat pasture shall they feed on the mountains of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK34_15" data-id="EK34_15">I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will cause them to lie down, says the Lord Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK34_16" data-id="EK34_16">I will seek that which was lost, and will bring back that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but the fat and the strong I will destroy; I will feed them in justice.</span>

<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK34_19" data-id="EK34_19">As for my sheep, they eat that which you have trodden with your feet, and they drink that which you have fouled with your feet. </span>
