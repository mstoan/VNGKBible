<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v M42_1" data-id="M42_1">And what wonder? if the lusts of the soul, after participation with what is beautiful, are frustrated,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v M42_2" data-id="M42_2">on this ground, therefore, the temperate Joseph is praised in that by reasoning, he subdued, on reflection, the indulgence of sense. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v M42_3" data-id="M42_3">For, although young, and ripe for sexual intercourse, he abrogated by reasoning the stimulus of his passions.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v M42_4" data-id="M42_4">And it is not merely the stimulus of sensual indulgence, but that of every desire, that reasoning is able to master.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v M42_5" data-id="M42_5">For instance, the law says, You shall not covet your neighborâ€™s wife, nor anything that belongs to your neighbor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v M42_6" data-id="M42_6">Now, then, since it is the law which has forbidden us to desire, I shall much the more easily persuade you, that reasoning is able to govern our lusts, just as it does the affections which are impediments to justice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v M42_7" data-id="M42_7">Since in what way is a solitary eater, and a glutton, and a drunkard reclaimed, unless it be clear that reasoning is lord of the passions? </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v M42_8" data-id="M42_8">A man, therefore, who regulates his course by the law, even if he be a lover of money, straightway puts force upon his own disposition; lending to the needy without interest, and cancelling the debt of the incoming Sabbath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v M42_9" data-id="M42_9">And should a man be parsimonious, he is ruled by the law acting through reasoning; so that he does not glean his harvest crops, nor vintage: and in reference to other points we may perceive that it is reasoning that conquers his passions.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v M42_10" data-id="M42_10">For the law conquers even affection toward parents, not surrendering virtue on their account.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v M42_11" data-id="M42_11">And it prevails over marriage love, condemning it when transgressing law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v M42_12" data-id="M42_12">And it lords it over the love of parents toward their children, for they punish them for vice; and it domineers over the intimacy of friends, reproving them when wicked. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v M42_13" data-id="M42_13">And think it not a strange assertion that reasoning can in behalf of the law conquer even enmity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v M42_14" data-id="M42_14">It allows not to cut down the cultivated herbage of an enemy, but preserves it from the destroyers, and collects their fallen ruins. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v M42_15" data-id="M42_15">And reason appears to be master of the more violent passions, as love of empire and empty boasting, and slander.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v M42_16" data-id="M42_16">For the temperate understanding repels all these malignant passions, as it does wrath: for it masters even this.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v M42_17" data-id="M42_17">Thus Moses, when angered against Dathan and Abiram, did nothing to them in wrath, but regulated his anger by reasoning.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v M42_18" data-id="M42_18">For the temperate mind is able, as I said, to be superior to the passions, and to transfer some, and destroy others.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v M42_19" data-id="M42_19">For why, else, does our most wise father Jacob blame Simeon and Levi for having irrationally slain the whole race of the Shechemites, saying, Cursed be their anger. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v M42_20" data-id="M42_20">For if reasoning did not possess the power of subduing angry affections, he would not have spoken thus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v M42_21" data-id="M42_21">For at the time when God created man, He implanted within him his passions and moral nature.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v M42_22" data-id="M42_22">And at that time He enthroned above all the holy leader mind, through the medium of the senses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v M42_23" data-id="M42_23">And He gave a law to this mind, by living according to which it will maintain a temperate, and just, and good, and manly reign. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v M42_24" data-id="M42_24">How, then, a man may say, if reasoning be master of the passions, has it no control over forgetfulness and ignorance?</span>
