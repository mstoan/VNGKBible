<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v K114_14" data-id="K114_14">Moreover Yahweh will raise up a king for himself over Israel, who will cut off the house of Jeroboam. This is the day! What? Even now. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v K114_15" data-id="K114_15">For Yahweh will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and he will root up Israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River,<span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> because they have made their Asherah poles, provoking Yahweh to anger.</span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v K114_22" data-id="K114_22">Judah did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, above all that their fathers had done. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v K114_23" data-id="K114_23">For they also built for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v K114_24" data-id="K114_24">There were also sodomites in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations which Yahweh drove out before the children of Israel. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v K114_25" data-id="K114_25">In the fifth year of king Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v K114_26" data-id="K114_26">and he took away the treasures of Yahweh’s house, and the treasures of the king’s house. He even took away all of it, including all the gold shields which Solomon had made. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v K114_27" data-id="K114_27">King Rehoboam made shields of brass in their place, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house. </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v K114_28" data-id="K114_28">It was so, that as often as the king went into Yahweh’s house, the guard bore them, and brought them back into the guard room. </span>
