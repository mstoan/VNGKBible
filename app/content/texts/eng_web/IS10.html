<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS10_25" data-id="IS10_25">For yet a very little while, and the indignation against you will be accomplished, and my anger will be directed to his destruction.” </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS10_26" data-id="IS10_26">Yahweh of Armies will stir up a scourge against him, as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb. His rod will be over the sea, and he will lift it up like he did against Egypt. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS10_27" data-id="IS10_27">It will happen in that day, that his burden will depart from off your shoulder, and his yoke from off your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil. </span>
