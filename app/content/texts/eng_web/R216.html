<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_6" data-id="R216_6">Then Asa the king took all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Rama, and its timber, with which Baasha had built; and he built Geba and Mizpah with them. </span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_7" data-id="R216_7">At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, “Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and have not relied on Yahweh your God, therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped out of your hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_8" data-id="R216_8">Weren’t the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge army, with chariots and horsemen exceeding many? Yet, because you relied on Yahweh, he delivered them into your hand. </span>
