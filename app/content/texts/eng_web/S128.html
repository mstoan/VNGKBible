<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S128_17" data-id="S128_17">Yahweh has done to you as he spoke by me. Yahweh has torn the kingdom out of your hand, and given it to your neighbor, even to David. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v S128_18" data-id="S128_18">Because you didn’t obey Yahweh’s voice, and didn’t execute his fierce wrath on Amalek, therefore Yahweh has done this thing to you today. </span>
