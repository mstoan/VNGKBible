<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v M112_51" data-id="M112_51">And they that followed upon them saw that they were ready to fight for their lives, and turned back again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v M112_52" data-id="M112_52">And they all came in peace into the land of Judah, and they mourned for Jonathan, and them that were with him, and they were sore afraid; and all Israel mourned with a great mourning. </span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v M112_53" data-id="M112_53">And all the Gentiles that were round about them sought to destroy them utterly: for they said, They have no ruler, nor any to help them: now therefore let us fight against them, and take away their memorial from among men.</span>
