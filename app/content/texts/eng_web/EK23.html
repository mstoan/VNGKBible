<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_3" data-id="EK23_3">They played the prostitute in Egypt. They played the prostitute in their youth. Their breasts were fondled there, and their youthful nipples were caressed there. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_4" data-id="EK23_4">Their names were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister. They became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah. </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_5" data-id="EK23_5">“Oholah played the prostitute when she was mine. She doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbors,</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_7" data-id="EK23_7">She gave herself as a prostitute to them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them. She defiled herself with the idols of whoever she lusted after. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK23_8" data-id="EK23_8">She hasn’t left her prostitution since leaving Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her. They carressed her youthful nipples; and they poured out their prostitution on her. </span>
