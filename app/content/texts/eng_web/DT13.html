<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT13_3" data-id="DT13_3">you shall not listen to the words of that prophet, or to that dreamer of dreams; for Yahweh your God is testing you, to know whether you love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul.</span>

So you shall remove the evil from among you.</span>
