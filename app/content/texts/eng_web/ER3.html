<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER3_9" data-id="ER3_9">Then Jeshua stood with his sons and his brothers, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to have the oversight of the workmen in God’s house: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brothers the Levites.</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER3_12" data-id="ER3_12">But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers’ households, the old men who had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice. Many also shouted aloud for joy,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER3_13" data-id="ER3_13">so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard far away.</span>
