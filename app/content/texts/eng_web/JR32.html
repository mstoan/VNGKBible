<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_2" data-id="JR32_2">Now at that time the king of Babylon’s army was besieging Jerusalem; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah’s house. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_3" data-id="JR32_3">For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, “Why do you prophesy, and say, ‘Yahweh says, “Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_4" data-id="JR32_4">and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall see his eyes;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_5" data-id="JR32_5">and he shall bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and he shall be there until I visit him,” says Yahweh: “though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not prosper?”’” </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_6" data-id="JR32_6">Jeremiah said, “Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,</span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_8" data-id="JR32_8">“So Hanamel my uncle’s son came to me in the court of the guard according to Yahweh’s word, and said to me, ‘Please buy my field that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption is yours; buy it for yourself.’ </span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_10" data-id="JR32_10">I signed the deed, sealed it, called witnesses, and weighed the money in the balances to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_11" data-id="JR32_11">So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, containing the terms and conditions, and that which was open; </span>

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_26" data-id="JR32_26">Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying,</span>

<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_30" data-id="JR32_30">“For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR32_31" data-id="JR32_31">For this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day; that I should remove it from before my face, </span>
