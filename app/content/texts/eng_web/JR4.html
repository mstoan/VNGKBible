<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_3" data-id="JR4_3">For Yahweh says to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, “Break up your fallow ground, and don’t sow among thorns.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_4" data-id="JR4_4">Circumcise yourselves to Yahweh, and take away the foreskins of your heart, you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go out like fire, and burn so that no one can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_5" data-id="JR4_5">Declare in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, ‘Blow the trumpet in the land!’ Cry aloud and say, ‘Assemble yourselves! Let us go into the fortified cities!’ </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_22" data-id="JR4_22">“For my people are foolish, they don’t know me. They are foolish children, and they have no understanding. They are skillful in doing evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.” </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_23" data-id="JR4_23">I saw the earth, and, behold, it was waste and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_29" data-id="JR4_29">Every city flees for the noise of the horsemen and archers; they go into the thickets, and climb up on the rocks: every city is forsaken, and not a man dwells therein. </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_30" data-id="JR4_30">You, when you are made desolate, what will you do?

They seek your life. </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR4_31" data-id="JR4_31">For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her who gives birth to her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, who gasps for breath, who spreads her hands, saying, “Woe is me now! For my soul faints before the murderers.” </span>
