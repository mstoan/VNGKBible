<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S118_11" data-id="S118_11">and Saul threw the spear, for he said, “I will pin David even to the wall!” David escaped from his presence twice.</span>

<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v S118_21" data-id="S118_21">Saul said, I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Therefore Saul said to David, “You shall today be my son-in-law a second time.”</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v S118_22" data-id="S118_22">Saul commanded his servants, “Talk with David secretly, and say, ‘Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you. Now therefore be the king’s son-in-law.’” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v S118_23" data-id="S118_23">Saul’s servants spoke those words in the ears of David. David said, “Does it seem to you a light thing to be the king’s son-in-law, since I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v S118_24" data-id="S118_24">The servants of Saul told him, saying, “David spoke like this.”</span>

<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v S118_27" data-id="S118_27">David arose and went, he and his men, and killed two hundred men of the Philistines. Then David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave him Michal his daughter as wife. </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v S118_28" data-id="S118_28">Saul saw and knew that Yahweh was with David; and Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved him.</span>
