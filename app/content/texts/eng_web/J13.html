<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_1" data-id="J13_1">See how great a love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God! For this cause the world doesn’t know us, because it didn’t know him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_2" data-id="J13_2">Beloved, now we are children of God, and it is not yet revealed what we will be. But we know that, when he is revealed, we will be like him; for we will see him just as he is. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_3" data-id="J13_3">Everyone who has this hope set on him purifies himself, even as he is pure.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_4" data-id="J13_4">Everyone who sins also commits lawlessness. Sin is lawlessness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_5" data-id="J13_5">You know that he was revealed to take away our sins, and in him is no sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_6" data-id="J13_6">Whoever remains in him doesn’t sin. Whoever sins hasn’t seen him and doesn’t know him.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_7" data-id="J13_7">Little children, let no one lead you astray. He who does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_8" data-id="J13_8">He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. To this end the Son of God was revealed: that he might destroy the works of the devil. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_9" data-id="J13_9">Whoever is born of God doesn’t commit sin, because his seed remains in him; and he can’t sin, because he is born of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_10" data-id="J13_10">In this the children of God are revealed, and the children of the devil. Whoever doesn’t do righteousness is not of God, neither is he who doesn’t love his brother. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_11" data-id="J13_11">For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_12" data-id="J13_12">unlike Cain, who was of the evil one, and killed his brother. Why did he kill him? Because his deeds were evil, and his brother’s righteous. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_13" data-id="J13_13">Don’t be surprised, my brothers, if the world hates you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_14" data-id="J13_14">We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. He who doesn’t love his brother remains in death. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_15" data-id="J13_15">Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_16" data-id="J13_16">By this we know love, because he laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_17" data-id="J13_17">But whoever has the world’s goods, and sees his brother in need, and closes his heart of compassion against him, how does God’s love remain in him? </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_18" data-id="J13_18">My little children, let’s not love in word only, or with the tongue only, but in deed and truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_19" data-id="J13_19">And by this we know that we are of the truth, and persuade our hearts before him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_20" data-id="J13_20">because if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_21" data-id="J13_21">Beloved, if our hearts don’t condemn us, we have boldness toward God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_22" data-id="J13_22">and whatever we ask, we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_23" data-id="J13_23">This is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he commanded. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_24" data-id="J13_24">He who keeps his commandments remains in him, and he in him. By this we know that he remains in us, by the Spirit which he gave us. </span>
