<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_6" data-id="NU22_6">Please come now therefore curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me.

<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_32" data-id="NU22_32">Yahweh’s angel said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out as an adversary, because your way is perverse before me. </span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_33" data-id="NU22_33">The donkey saw me, and turned aside before me these three times. Unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I would have killed you, and saved her alive.” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_34" data-id="NU22_34">Balaam said to Yahweh’s angel, “I have sinned; for I didn’t know that you stood in the way against me. Now therefore, if it displeases you, I will go back again.” </span>
