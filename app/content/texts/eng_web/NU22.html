<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_3" data-id="NU22_3">Moab was very afraid of the people, because they were many. Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.</span>

<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_5" data-id="NU22_5">He sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, “Behold, there is a people who came out of Egypt. Behold, they cover the surface of the earth, and they are staying opposite me. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_6" data-id="NU22_6">Please come now therefore curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall prevail, that we may strike them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_7" data-id="NU22_7">The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand. They came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak. </span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_8" data-id="NU22_8">He said to them, “Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as Yahweh shall speak to me.” The princes of Moab stayed with Balaam. </span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_22" data-id="NU22_22">God’s anger burned because he went; and Yahweh’s angel placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_23" data-id="NU22_23">The donkey saw Yahweh’s angel standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the donkey turned aside out of the way, and went into the field. Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_24" data-id="NU22_24">Then Yahweh’s angel stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_25" data-id="NU22_25">The donkey saw Yahweh’s angel, and she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall. He struck her again. </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_26" data-id="NU22_26">Yahweh’s angel went further, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_27" data-id="NU22_27">The donkey saw Yahweh’s angel, and she lay down under Balaam. Balaam’s anger burned, and he struck the donkey with his staff. </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_28" data-id="NU22_28">Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_29" data-id="NU22_29">Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you have mocked me, I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would have killed you.” </span>

<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_30" data-id="NU22_30">The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long until today? Was I ever in the habit of doing so to you?” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v NU22_30" data-id="NU22_30">He said, “No.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_31" data-id="NU22_31">Then Yahweh opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw Yahweh’s angel standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face. </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_32" data-id="NU22_32">Yahweh’s angel said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out as an adversary, because your way is perverse before me. </span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_33" data-id="NU22_33">The donkey saw me, and turned aside before me these three times. Unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I would have killed you, and saved her alive.” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_34" data-id="NU22_34">Balaam said to Yahweh’s angel, “I have sinned; for I didn’t know that you stood in the way against me. Now therefore, if it displeases you, I will go back again.” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_35" data-id="NU22_35">Yahweh’s angel said to Balaam, “Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak to you, that you shall speak.”</span>

<span class="v NU22_35" data-id="NU22_35">So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_36" data-id="NU22_36">When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him to the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border. </span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_37" data-id="NU22_37">Balak said to Balaam, “Didn’t I earnestly send to you to call you? Why didn’t you come to me? Am I not able indeed to promote you to honor?” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_38" data-id="NU22_38">Balaam said to Balak, “Behold, I have come to you. Have I now any power at all to speak anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak.” </span>
