All who burden themselves with it will be severely wounded, and all the nations of the earth will be gathered together against it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_4" data-id="ZC12_4">In that day,” says Yahweh, “I will strike every horse with terror, and his rider with madness; and I will open my eyes on the house of Judah, and will strike every horse of the peoples with blindness.</span>

<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_6" data-id="ZC12_6">In that day I will make the chieftains of Judah like a pan of fire among wood, and like a flaming torch among sheaves; and they will devour all the surrounding peoples, on the right hand and on the left; and Jerusalem will yet again dwell in their own place, even in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_7" data-id="ZC12_7">Yahweh also will save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of David’s house and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem not be magnified above Judah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_8" data-id="ZC12_8">In that day Yahweh will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem. He who is feeble among them at that day will be like David, and David’s house will be like God, like Yahweh’s angel before them.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC12_11" data-id="ZC12_11">In that day there will be a great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.</span>
