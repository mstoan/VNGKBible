<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_1" data-id="H15_1">But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_2" data-id="H15_2">For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_3" data-id="H15_3">For when they are saying, “Peace and safety,” then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman; and they will in no way escape. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_4" data-id="H15_4">But you, brothers, aren’t in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_5" data-id="H15_5">You are all children of light, and children of the day. We don’t belong to the night, nor to darkness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_6" data-id="H15_6">so then let’s not sleep, as the rest do, but let’s watch and be sober.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_7" data-id="H15_7">For those who sleep, sleep in the night; and those who are drunk are drunk in the night.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_8" data-id="H15_8">But let us, since we belong to the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and, for a helmet, the hope of salvation. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_9" data-id="H15_9">For God didn’t appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_10" data-id="H15_10">who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_15" data-id="H15_15">See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone, but always follow after that which is good, for one another, and for all. </span>
