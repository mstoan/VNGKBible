<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_1" data-id="GL6_1">Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to yourself so that you also aren’t tempted. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_2" data-id="GL6_2">Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_3" data-id="GL6_3">For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_4" data-id="GL6_4">But let each man examine his own work, and then he will have reason to boast in himself, and not in someone else.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_5" data-id="GL6_5">For each man will bear his own burden.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_6" data-id="GL6_6">But let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_7" data-id="GL6_7">Don’t be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_8" data-id="GL6_8">For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_9" data-id="GL6_9">Let us not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season, if we don’t give up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_10" data-id="GL6_10">So then, as we have opportunity, let’s do what is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith. </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_11" data-id="GL6_11">See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_12" data-id="GL6_12">As many as desire to look good in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_13" data-id="GL6_13">For even they who receive circumcision don’t keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_14" data-id="GL6_14">But far be it from me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_15" data-id="GL6_15">For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_16" data-id="GL6_16">As many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on God’s Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_17" data-id="GL6_17">From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body.</span>
