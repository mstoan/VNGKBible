<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_1" data-id="PM1_1">Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_2" data-id="PM1_2">to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_3" data-id="PM1_3">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_4" data-id="PM1_4">I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_5" data-id="PM1_5">hearing of your love, and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_6" data-id="PM1_6">that the fellowship of your faith may become effective, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_7" data-id="PM1_7">For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.</span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_8" data-id="PM1_8">Therefore though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_9" data-id="PM1_9">yet for love’s sake I rather beg, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_10" data-id="PM1_10">I beg you for my child, whom I have become the father of in my chains, Onesimus, <span class="note" id="note-1"><a class="key" href="#footnote-1">+</a></span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_11" data-id="PM1_11">who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_12" data-id="PM1_12">I am sending him back. Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_13" data-id="PM1_13">whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_14" data-id="PM1_14">But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_15" data-id="PM1_15">For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while, that you would have him forever,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_16" data-id="PM1_16">no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. </span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_17" data-id="PM1_17">If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.</span>
