<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_3" data-id="MT27_3">Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, </span>

<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_6" data-id="MT27_6">The chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, “It’s not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.” </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_7" data-id="MT27_7">They took counsel, and bought the potter’s field with them, to bury strangers in.</span>

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v MT27_11" data-id="MT27_11">Jesus said to him, <span class="wj woj">“So you say.”</span></span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_13" data-id="MT27_13">Then Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many things they testify against you?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_14" data-id="MT27_14">He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_15" data-id="MT27_15">Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they desired.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_16" data-id="MT27_16">They had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_17" data-id="MT27_17">When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?” </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_18" data-id="MT27_18">For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up.</span>

<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_19" data-id="MT27_19">While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of him.” </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_20" data-id="MT27_20">Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_21" data-id="MT27_21">But the governor answered them, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v MT27_21" data-id="MT27_21">They said, “Barabbas!”</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_22" data-id="MT27_22">Pilate said to them, “What then shall I do to Jesus, who is called Christ?”</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v MT27_22" data-id="MT27_22">They all said to him, “Let him be crucified!”</span>

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_25" data-id="MT27_25">All the people answered, “May his blood be on us, and on our children!”</span>

<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_27" data-id="MT27_27">Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together against him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_28" data-id="MT27_28">They stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him.</span>

<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_30" data-id="MT27_30">They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_31" data-id="MT27_31">When they had mocked him, they took the robe off of him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.</span>

<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_35" data-id="MT27_35">When they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among them, casting lots,<span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_36" data-id="MT27_36">and they sat and watched him there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_37" data-id="MT27_37">They set up over his head the accusation against him written, “THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_38" data-id="MT27_38">Then there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left.</span>

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_41" data-id="MT27_41">Likewise the chief priests also mocking, with the scribes, the Pharisees,<span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> and the elders, said,</span>

<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_44" data-id="MT27_44">The robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach.</span>

<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_49" data-id="MT27_49">The rest said, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to save him.”</span>

<span class="v-num v-65">65&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT27_65" data-id="MT27_65">Pilate said to them, “You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can.”</span>
