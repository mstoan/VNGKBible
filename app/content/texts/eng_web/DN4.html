<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_5" data-id="DN4_5">I saw a dream which made me afraid; and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_6" data-id="DN4_6">Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream. </span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_8" data-id="DN4_8">But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and I told the dream before him, saying,</span>

<div class="pi">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN4_13" data-id="DN4_13">I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from the sky.</span>
