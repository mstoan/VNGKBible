<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_1" data-id="GL3_1">Foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you not to obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed among you as crucified? </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_2" data-id="GL3_2">I just want to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_3" data-id="GL3_3">Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now completed in the flesh?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_4" data-id="GL3_4">Did you suffer so many things in vain, if it is indeed in vain?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_5" data-id="GL3_5">He therefore who supplies the Spirit to you, and does miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith? </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_6" data-id="GL3_6">Even as Abraham “believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.”</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_7" data-id="GL3_7">Know therefore that those who are of faith, the same are children of Abraham.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_8" data-id="GL3_8">The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Good News beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you all the nations will be blessed.”<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Genesis 12:3; 18:18; 22:18</span></span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_9" data-id="GL3_9">So then, those who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_10" data-id="GL3_10">For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written, “Cursed is everyone who doesn’t continue in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.”<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Deuteronomy 27:26</span></span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_11" data-id="GL3_11">Now that no man is justified by the law before God is evident, for, “The righteous will live by faith.”<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Habakkuk 2:4</span></span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_12" data-id="GL3_12">The law is not of faith, but, “The man who does them will live by them.”<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Leviticus 18:5</span></span> </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_13" data-id="GL3_13">Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us. For it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,”<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Deuteronomy 21:23</span></span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_14" data-id="GL3_14">that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_15" data-id="GL3_15">Brothers, speaking of human terms, though it is only a man’s covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void, or adds to it. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_16" data-id="GL3_16">Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring.<span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> He doesn’t say, “To descendants<span class="note" id="note-3"><a class="key" href="#footnote-3">+</a></span>”, as of many, but as of one, “To your offspring<span class="note" id="note-4"><a class="key" href="#footnote-4">+</a></span>”,<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Genesis 12:7; 13:15; 24:7</span></span> which is Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_17" data-id="GL3_17">Now I say this. A covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ, the law, which came four hundred thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_18" data-id="GL3_18">For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_19" data-id="GL3_19">What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring<span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> should come to whom the promise has been made. It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_20" data-id="GL3_20">Now a mediator is not between one, but God is one.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_21" data-id="GL3_21">Is the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could make alive, most certainly righteousness would have been of the law. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_22" data-id="GL3_22">But the Scriptures imprisoned all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_23" data-id="GL3_23">But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, confined for the faith which should afterwards be revealed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_24" data-id="GL3_24">So that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_25" data-id="GL3_25">But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_26" data-id="GL3_26">For you are all children of God, through faith in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_27" data-id="GL3_27">For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_28" data-id="GL3_28">There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_29" data-id="GL3_29">If you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s offspring<span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> and heirs according to promise. </span>
