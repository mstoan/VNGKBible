<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_5" data-id="R214_5">Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun images; and the kingdom was quiet before him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_6" data-id="R214_6">He built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Yahweh had given him rest. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_7" data-id="R214_7">For he said to Judah, “Let us build these cities, and make walls around them, with towers, gates, and bars.
