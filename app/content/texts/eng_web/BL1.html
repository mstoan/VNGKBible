<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_1" data-id="BL1_1">AND king Astyages was gathered to his fathers, and Cyrus the Persian received his kingdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_2" data-id="BL1_2">And Daniel lived with the king, and was honored above all his friends.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_3" data-id="BL1_3">Now the Babylonians had an idol, called Bel, and there were spent upon him every day twelve great measures of fine flour, and forty sheep, and six firkins of wine. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_4" data-id="BL1_4">And the king did honor to it, and went daily to worship it: but Daniel worshipped his own God. And the king said to him, Why do you not worship Bel? </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_5" data-id="BL1_5">And he said, Because I may not do honor to idols made with hands, but to the living God, who has created the heaven and the earth, and has sovereignty over all flesh. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_6" data-id="BL1_6">Then said the king to him, Thinkest you not that Bel is a living god? or see you not how much he eats and drinks every day? </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_7" data-id="BL1_7">Then Daniel laughed, and said, O king, be not deceived: for this is but clay within, and brass without, and did never eat or drink anything. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_8" data-id="BL1_8">So the king was angry, and called for his priests, and said to them, If you⌃ tell me not who this is that devours these expenses, you⌃ shall die. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_9" data-id="BL1_9">But if you⌃ can show me that Bel devours them, then Daniel shall die: for he has spoken blasphemy against Bel. And Daniel said to the king, Let it be according to your word. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_10" data-id="BL1_10">Now the priests of Bel were threescore and ten, beside their wives and children. And the king went with Daniel into the temple of Bel. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_11" data-id="BL1_11">So Bel’s priests said, Behold, we will get us out: but you, O king, set on the meat, and mingle the wine and set it forth, and shut the door fast, and seal it with your own signet;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_12" data-id="BL1_12">and when you come in the morning, if you find not that Bel has eaten up all, we will suffer death: or else Daniel, that speaks falsely against us. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_13" data-id="BL1_13">And they little regarded it: for under the table they had made a privy entrance, whereby they entered in continually, and consumed those things. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_14" data-id="BL1_14">And it came to pass, when they were gone forth, the king set the meat before Bel. Now Daniel had commanded his servants to bring ashes, and they strewed all the temple <span class="add">with them </span> in the presence of the king alone: then they went out, and shut the door, and sealed it with the king’s signet, and so departed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_15" data-id="BL1_15">Now in the night came the priests with their wives and children, as they were wont to do, and did eat and drink up all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_16" data-id="BL1_16">In the morning betime the king arose, and Daniel with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_17" data-id="BL1_17">And the king said, Daniel, are the seals whole? And he said, Yes, O king, they be whole.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_18" data-id="BL1_18">And as soon as he had opened the door, the king looked upon the table, and cried with a loud voice, Great are you, O Bel, and with you is no deceit at all. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_19" data-id="BL1_19">Then laughed Daniel, and held the king that he should not go in, and said, Behold now the pavement, and mark well whose footsteps are these. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_20" data-id="BL1_20">And the king said, I see the footsteps of men, women, and children. And then the king was angry,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_21" data-id="BL1_21">and took the priests with their wives and children, who showed him the privy doors, where they came in, and consumed such things as were upon the table. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_22" data-id="BL1_22">Therefore the king killed them, and delivered Bel into Daniel’s power, who overthrew him and his temple.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_23" data-id="BL1_23">And in that same place there was a great <span class="note" id="note-1"><a class="key" href="#footnote-1"></a></span><span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2"></a></span><span class="note" id="note-3"><a class="key" href="#footnote-3"></a></span> dragon, which they of Babylon worshipped. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_24" data-id="BL1_24">And the king said to Daniel, Wilt you also say that this is of brass? behold, he lives, and eats and drinks; you can not say that he is no living god: therefore worship him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_25" data-id="BL1_25">Then said Daniel, I will worship the Lord my God: for he is a living God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_26" data-id="BL1_26">But give me leave, O king, and I shall kill this dragon without sword or staff. The king said, I give you leave.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_27" data-id="BL1_27">Then Daniel took pitch, and fat, and hair, and did seethe them together, and made lumps thereof: this he put in the dragon’s mouth, so the dragon did eat and burst in sunder: and <span class="add">Daniel </span> said, Behold, these are the gods you⌃ worship. </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_28" data-id="BL1_28">When they of Babylon heard that, they took great indignation, and conspired against the king, saying, The king is become a Jew, and he has pulled down Bel, and slain the dragon, and put the priests to the sword.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_29" data-id="BL1_29">So they came to the king, and said, Deliver us Daniel, or else we will destroy you and your house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_30" data-id="BL1_30">Now when the king saw that they pressed him sore, being constrained, the king delivered Daniel to them:</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_31" data-id="BL1_31">who cast him into the lion’s den: where he was six days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_32" data-id="BL1_32">And in the den there were seven lions, and they had given them every day two carcases, and two sheep: which then were not given to them, to the intent they might devour Daniel. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_33" data-id="BL1_33">Now there was in Jewry the prophet <span class="note" id="note-4"><a class="key" href="#footnote-4"></a></span><span class="note" id="note-5"><a class="key" href="#footnote-5"></a></span><span class="note" id="note-6"><a class="key" href="#footnote-6"></a></span> Habakkuk, who had made pottage, and had broken bread into a bowl, and was going into the field, for to bring it to the reapers. </span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_34" data-id="BL1_34">But the angel of the Lord said to Habakkuk, Go carry the dinner that you have into Babylon to Daniel, in the lions’ den.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_35" data-id="BL1_35">And Habakkuk said, Lord, I never saw Babylon; neither do I know where the den is.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_36" data-id="BL1_36">Then the angel of the Lord took him by the crown, and lifted him up by the hair of his head, and with the blast of his breath set him in Babylon over the den. </span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_37" data-id="BL1_37">And Habakkuk cried, saying, O Daniel, Daniel, take the dinner which God has sent you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_38" data-id="BL1_38">And Daniel said, You have remembered me, O God: neither have you forsaken them that love you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_39" data-id="BL1_39">So Daniel arose, and did eat: and the angel of God set Habakkuk in his own place again immediately.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_40" data-id="BL1_40">Upon the seventh day the king came to bewail Daniel: and when he came to the den, he looked in, and, behold, Daniel was sitting. </span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_41" data-id="BL1_41">Then cried the king with a loud voice, saying, Great are you, O Lord, you God of Daniel, and there is none other beside you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v BL1_42" data-id="BL1_42">And he drew him out, and cast those that were the cause of his destruction into the den: and they were devoured in a moment before his face. </span>
