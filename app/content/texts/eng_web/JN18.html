<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_2" data-id="JN18_2">Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, for Jesus often met there with his disciples.</span>

<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_4" data-id="JN18_4">Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were happening to him, went out, and said to them, <span class="wj woj">“Who are you looking for?”</span> </span>

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_12" data-id="JN18_12">So the detachment, the commanding officer, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_13" data-id="JN18_13">and led him to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_17" data-id="JN18_17">Then the maid who kept the door said to Peter, “Are you also one of this man’s disciples?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v JN18_17" data-id="JN18_17">He said, “I am not.”</span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_18" data-id="JN18_18">Now the servants and the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold. They were warming themselves. Peter was with them, standing and warming himself. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_19" data-id="JN18_19">The high priest therefore asked Jesus about his disciples, and about his teaching.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_20" data-id="JN18_20">Jesus answered him, <span class="wj woj">“I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where the Jews always meet. I said nothing in secret. </span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_21" data-id="JN18_21"> <span class="wj woj">Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them. Behold, these know the things which I said.”</span> </span>

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v JN18_25" data-id="JN18_25">He denied it, and said, “I am not.”</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_27" data-id="JN18_27">Peter therefore denied it again, and immediately the rooster crowed.</span>

<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_28" data-id="JN18_28">They led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium. It was early, and they themselves didn’t enter into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_29" data-id="JN18_29">Pilate therefore went out to them, and said, “What accusation do you bring against this man?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_30" data-id="JN18_30">They answered him, “If this man weren’t an evildoer, we wouldn’t have delivered him up to you.”</span>

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_34" data-id="JN18_34">Jesus answered him, <span class="wj woj">“Do you say this by yourself, or did others tell you about me?”</span> </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_35" data-id="JN18_35">Pilate answered, “I’m not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me. What have you done?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_36" data-id="JN18_36">Jesus answered, <span class="wj woj">“My Kingdom is not of this world.

<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_37" data-id="JN18_37">Pilate therefore said to him, “Are you a king then?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v JN18_37" data-id="JN18_37">Jesus answered, <span class="wj woj">“You say that I am a king. For this reason I have been born, and for this reason I have come into the world, that I should testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice.”</span> </span>
</div>
