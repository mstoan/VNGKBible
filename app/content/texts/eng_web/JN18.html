<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_2" data-id="JN18_2">Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, for Jesus often met there with his disciples.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_3" data-id="JN18_3">Judas then, having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_4" data-id="JN18_4">Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were happening to him, went out, and said to them, <span class="wj woj">“Who are you looking for?”</span> </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_5" data-id="JN18_5">They answered him, “Jesus of Nazareth.”</span>

<span class="v JN18_5" data-id="JN18_5">Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_6" data-id="JN18_6">When therefore he said to them, <span class="wj woj">“I am he,”</span> they went backward, and fell to the ground.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_7" data-id="JN18_7">Again therefore he asked them, <span class="wj woj">“Who are you looking for?”</span></span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_11" data-id="JN18_11">Jesus therefore said to Peter, <span class="wj woj">“Put the sword into its sheath. The cup which the Father has given me, shall I not surely drink it?”</span> </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_12" data-id="JN18_12">So the detachment, the commanding officer, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_13" data-id="JN18_13">and led him to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_14" data-id="JN18_14">Now it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should perish for the people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_15" data-id="JN18_15">Simon Peter followed Jesus, as did another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest; </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_16" data-id="JN18_16">but Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_17" data-id="JN18_17">Then the maid who kept the door said to Peter, “Are you also one of this man’s disciples?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v JN18_17" data-id="JN18_17">He said, “I am not.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_18" data-id="JN18_18">Now the servants and the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold. They were warming themselves. Peter was with them, standing and warming himself. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_19" data-id="JN18_19">The high priest therefore asked Jesus about his disciples, and about his teaching.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_20" data-id="JN18_20">Jesus answered him, <span class="wj woj">“I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where the Jews always meet. I said nothing in secret. </span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_21" data-id="JN18_21"> <span class="wj woj">Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them. Behold, these know the things which I said.”</span> </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_22" data-id="JN18_22">When he had said this, one of the officers standing by slapped Jesus with his hand, saying, “Do you answer the high priest like that?” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_23" data-id="JN18_23">Jesus answered him, <span class="wj woj">“If I have spoken evil, testify of the evil; but if well, why do you beat me?”</span> </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_24" data-id="JN18_24">Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas, the high priest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_25" data-id="JN18_25">Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him, “You aren’t also one of his disciples, are you?” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v JN18_25" data-id="JN18_25">He denied it, and said, “I am not.”</span>

<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_26" data-id="JN18_26">One of the servants of the high priest, being a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off, said, “Didn’t I see you in the garden with him?” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_27" data-id="JN18_27">Peter therefore denied it again, and immediately the rooster crowed.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_28" data-id="JN18_28">They led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium. It was early, and they themselves didn’t enter into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_29" data-id="JN18_29">Pilate therefore went out to them, and said, “What accusation do you bring against this man?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_30" data-id="JN18_30">They answered him, “If this man weren’t an evildoer, we wouldn’t have delivered him up to you.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_31" data-id="JN18_31">Pilate therefore said to them, “Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v JN18_31" data-id="JN18_31">Therefore the Jews said to him, “It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,”</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_32" data-id="JN18_32">that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what kind of death he should die.</span>

<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_33" data-id="JN18_33">Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, called Jesus, and said to him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_34" data-id="JN18_34">Jesus answered him, <span class="wj woj">“Do you say this by yourself, or did others tell you about me?”</span> </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_35" data-id="JN18_35">Pilate answered, “I’m not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me. What have you done?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_36" data-id="JN18_36">Jesus answered, <span class="wj woj">“My Kingdom is not of this world.

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_37" data-id="JN18_37">Pilate therefore said to him, “Are you a king then?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v JN18_37" data-id="JN18_37">Jesus answered, <span class="wj woj">“You say that I am a king. For this reason I have been born, and for this reason I have come into the world, that I should testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice.”</span> </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_38" data-id="JN18_38">Pilate said to him, “What is truth?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v JN18_38" data-id="JN18_38">When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, “I find no basis for a charge against him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_39" data-id="JN18_39">But you have a custom, that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Therefore do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN18_40" data-id="JN18_40">Then they all shouted again, saying, “Not this man, but Barabbas!” Now Barabbas was a robber.</span>
