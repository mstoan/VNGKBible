<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_21" data-id="PP1_21">For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_22" data-id="PP1_22">But if I live on in the flesh, this will bring fruit from my work; yet I don’t know what I will choose.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_23" data-id="PP1_23">But I am in a dilemma between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_24" data-id="PP1_24">Yet, to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake.</span>

<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_28" data-id="PP1_28">and in nothing frightened by the adversaries, which is for them a proof of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that from God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_29" data-id="PP1_29">Because it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on his behalf,</span>
