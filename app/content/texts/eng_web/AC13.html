<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_2" data-id="AC13_2">As they served the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, “Separate Barnabas and Saul for me, for the work to which I have called them.” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_3" data-id="AC13_3">Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_4" data-id="AC13_4">So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia. From there they sailed to Cyprus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_5" data-id="AC13_5">When they were at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. They had also John as their attendant. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_6" data-id="AC13_6">When they had gone through the island to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar Jesus, </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_7" data-id="AC13_7">who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_8" data-id="AC13_8">But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_9" data-id="AC13_9">But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_10" data-id="AC13_10">and said, “Full of all deceit and all cunning, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_11" data-id="AC13_11">Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is on you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a season!”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v AC13_11" data-id="AC13_11">Immediately a mist and darkness fell on him. He went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_12" data-id="AC13_12">Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_13" data-id="AC13_13">Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia. John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_14" data-id="AC13_14">But they, passing on from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia. They went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and sat down. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_15" data-id="AC13_15">After the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, “Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, speak.” </span>

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_46" data-id="AC13_46">Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, and said, “It was necessary that God’s word should be spoken to you first.
