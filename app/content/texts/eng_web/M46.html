<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_1" data-id="M46_1">When Eleazar had in this manner answered the exhortations of the tyrant, the spearbearers came up, and rudely haled Eleazar to the instruments of torture. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_2" data-id="M46_2">And first, they stripped the old man, adorned as he was with the comeliness of piety.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_3" data-id="M46_3">Then tying back his arms and hands, they disdainfully used him with stripes;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_4" data-id="M46_4">a herald opposite crying out, Obey the commands of the king.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_5" data-id="M46_5">But Eleazar, the high-minded and truly noble, as one tortured in a dream, regarded it not all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_6" data-id="M46_6">But raising his eyes on high to heaven, the old man’s flesh was stripped off by the scourges, and his blood streamed down, and his sides were pierced through. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_7" data-id="M46_7">And falling upon the ground, from his body having no power to support the pains, he yet kept his reasoning upright and unbending. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_8" data-id="M46_8">then one of the harsh spearbearers leaped upon his belly as he was falling, to force him upright.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_9" data-id="M46_9">But he endured the pains, and despised the cruelty, and persevered through the indignities;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_10" data-id="M46_10">and like a noble athlete, the old man, when struck, vanquished his torturers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_11" data-id="M46_11">His countenance sweating, and he panting for breath, he was admired by the very torturers for his courage.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_12" data-id="M46_12">Wherefore, partly in pity for his old age,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_13" data-id="M46_13">partly from the sympathy of acquaintance, and partly in admiration of his endurance, some of the attendants of the king said, </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_14" data-id="M46_14">Why do you unreasonably destroy yourself, O Eleazar, with these miseries?</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_15" data-id="M46_15">We will bring you some meat cooked by yourself, and do you save yourself by pretending that you have eaten swine’s flesh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_16" data-id="M46_16">And Eleazar, as though the advice more painfully tortured him, cried out,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_17" data-id="M46_17">Let not us who are children of Abraham be so evil advised as by giving way to make use of an unbecoming pretense;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_18" data-id="M46_18">for it were irrational, if having lived up to old age in all truth, and having scrupulously guarded our character for it, we should now turn back, </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_19" data-id="M46_19">and ourselves should become a pattern of impiety to the young, as being an example of pollution eating.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_20" data-id="M46_20">It would be disgraceful if we should live on some short time, and that scorned by all men for cowardice,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_21" data-id="M46_21">and be condemned by the tyrant for unmanliness, by not contending to the death for our divine law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_22" data-id="M46_22">Wherefore do you, O children of Abraham, die nobly for your religion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_23" data-id="M46_23">You⌃ spearbearers of the tyrant, why do you⌃ linger?</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_24" data-id="M46_24">Beholding him so high-minded against misery, and not changing at their pity, they led him to the fire:</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_25" data-id="M46_25">then with their wickedly contrived instruments they burned him on the fire, and poured stinking fluids down into his nostrils. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_26" data-id="M46_26">And he being at length burned down to the bones, and about to expire, raised his eyes Godward, and said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_27" data-id="M46_27">You know, O God, that when I might have been saved, I am slain for the sake of the law by tortures of fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_28" data-id="M46_28">Be merciful to your people, and be satisfied with the punishment of me on their account.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_29" data-id="M46_29">Let my blood be a purification for them, and take my life in recompense for theirs.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_30" data-id="M46_30">Thus speaking, the holy man departed, noble in his torments, and even to the agonies of death resisted in his reasoning for the sake of the law. </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_31" data-id="M46_31">Confessedly, therefore, religious reasoning is master of the passions.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_32" data-id="M46_32">For had the passions been superior to reasoning, I would have given them the witness of this mastery.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_33" data-id="M46_33">But now, since reasoning conquered the passions, we befittingly awared it the authority of first place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_34" data-id="M46_34">And it is but fair that we should allow, that the power belongs to reasoning, since it masters external miseries.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v M46_35" data-id="M46_35">Ridiculous would it be were it not so; and I prove that reasoning has not only mastered pains, but that it is also superior to the pleasures, and withstands them. </span>
