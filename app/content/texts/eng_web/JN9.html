<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_1" data-id="JN9_1">As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_2" data-id="JN9_2">His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_3" data-id="JN9_3">Jesus answered, <span class="wj woj">“Neither did this man sin, nor his parents; but, that the works of God might be revealed in him. </span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_4" data-id="JN9_4"> <span class="wj woj">I must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work. </span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_5" data-id="JN9_5"> <span class="wj woj">While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”</span></span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_6" data-id="JN9_6">When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man’s eyes with the mud,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_7" data-id="JN9_7">and said to him, <span class="wj woj">“Go, wash in the pool of Siloam”</span> (which means “Sent”). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_8" data-id="JN9_8">The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was blind before, said, “Isn’t this he who sat and begged?”</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_9" data-id="JN9_9">Others were saying, “It is he.” Still others were saying, “He looks like him.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v JN9_9" data-id="JN9_9">He said, “I am he.”</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_10" data-id="JN9_10">They therefore were asking him, “How were your eyes opened?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_11" data-id="JN9_11">He answered, “A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, <span class="wj woj">‘Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash.’</span> So I went away and washed, and I received sight.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_12" data-id="JN9_12">Then they asked him, “Where is he?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v JN9_12" data-id="JN9_12">He said, “I don’t know.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_13" data-id="JN9_13">They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_14" data-id="JN9_14">It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_15" data-id="JN9_15">Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, “He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see.” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_16" data-id="JN9_16">Some therefore of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, because he doesn’t keep the Sabbath.” Others said, “How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” There was division among them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_17" data-id="JN9_17">Therefore they asked the blind man again, “What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v JN9_17" data-id="JN9_17">He said, “He is a prophet.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_18" data-id="JN9_18">The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight, </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_19" data-id="JN9_19">and asked them, “Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_20" data-id="JN9_20">His parents answered them, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_21" data-id="JN9_21">but how he now sees, we don’t know; or who opened his eyes, we don’t know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself.” </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_22" data-id="JN9_22">His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_23" data-id="JN9_23">Therefore his parents said, “He is of age. Ask him.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_24" data-id="JN9_24">So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, “Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_25" data-id="JN9_25">He therefore answered, “I don’t know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_26" data-id="JN9_26">They said to him again, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_27" data-id="JN9_27">He answered them, “I told you already, and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don’t also want to become his disciples, do you?” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_28" data-id="JN9_28">They insulted him and said, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_29" data-id="JN9_29">We know that God has spoken to Moses. But as for this man, we don’t know where he comes from.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_30" data-id="JN9_30">The man answered them, “How amazing! You don’t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_31" data-id="JN9_31">We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God, and does his will, he listens to him.<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Psalm 66:18, Proverbs 15:29; 28:9</span></span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_32" data-id="JN9_32">Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_33" data-id="JN9_33">If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_34" data-id="JN9_34">They answered him, “You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?” They threw him out.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_35" data-id="JN9_35">Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, <span class="wj woj">“Do you believe in the Son of God?”</span> </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_36" data-id="JN9_36">He answered, “Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_37" data-id="JN9_37">Jesus said to him, <span class="wj woj">“You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you.”</span> </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_38" data-id="JN9_38">He said, “Lord, I believe!” and he worshiped him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_39" data-id="JN9_39">Jesus said, <span class="wj woj">“I came into this world for judgment, that those who don’t see may see; and that those who see may become blind.”</span> </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_40" data-id="JN9_40">Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, “Are we also blind?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_41" data-id="JN9_41">Jesus said to them, <span class="wj woj">“If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, ‘We see.’ Therefore your sin remains.</span> </span>
