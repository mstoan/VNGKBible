<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v K19_7" data-id="K19_7">then I will cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and I will cast this house, which I have made holy for my name, out of my sight; and Israel will be a proverb and a byword among all peoples.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v K19_8" data-id="K19_8">Though this house is so high, yet everyone who passes by it will be astonished and hiss; and they will say, ‘Why has Yahweh done this to this land, and to this house?’ </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v K19_9" data-id="K19_9">and they will answer, ‘Because they abandoned Yahweh their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold of other gods, and worshiped them, and served them. Therefore Yahweh has brought all this evil on them.’”</span>
