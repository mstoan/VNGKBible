<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_3" data-id="T21_3">I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_4" data-id="T21_4">longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_5" data-id="T21_5">having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you; which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_6" data-id="T21_6">For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_7" data-id="T21_7">For God didn’t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_8" data-id="T21_8">Therefore don’t be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God, </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_9" data-id="T21_9">who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_10" data-id="T21_10">but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_11" data-id="T21_11">For this, I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v T21_12" data-id="T21_12">Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day. </span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_13" data-id="T21_13">Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_16" data-id="T21_16">May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_17" data-id="T21_17">but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_18" data-id="T21_18">(the Lord grant to him to find the Lord’s mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well. </span>
