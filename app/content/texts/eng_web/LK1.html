<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_3" data-id="LK1_3">it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus; </span>

<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_5" data-id="LK1_5">There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_6" data-id="LK1_6">They were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_7" data-id="LK1_7">But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_8" data-id="LK1_8">Now while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his division,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_9" data-id="LK1_9">according to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_10" data-id="LK1_10">The whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_11" data-id="LK1_11">An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_12" data-id="LK1_12">Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_13" data-id="LK1_13">But the angel said to him, “Don’t be afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been heard, and your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_14" data-id="LK1_14">You will have joy and gladness; and many will rejoice at his birth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_15" data-id="LK1_15">For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_16" data-id="LK1_16">He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord, their God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_17" data-id="LK1_17">He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, ‘to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,’ and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to prepare a people prepared for the Lord.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_18" data-id="LK1_18">Zacharias said to the angel, “How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.”</span>

<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_21" data-id="LK1_21">The people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled that he delayed in the temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_22" data-id="LK1_22">When he came out, he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. He continued making signs to them, and remained mute. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_23" data-id="LK1_23">When the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_24" data-id="LK1_24">After these days Elizabeth, his wife, conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying,</span>
