<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v M21_33" data-id="M21_33">And when the matter became known, and it was told the king of the Persians, that, in the place where the priests that were led away had hid the fire, there appeared the water, wherewith also Nehemiah and they that were with him purified the sacrifice, </span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v M21_34" data-id="M21_34">then the king, inclosing <span class="add">the place, </span> made it sacred, after he had proved the matter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v M21_35" data-id="M21_35">And when the king would show favor to any, he would take <span class="add">from them </span> many presents and give them some of <span class="add">this water. </span></span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v M21_36" data-id="M21_36">And Nehemiah and they that were with him called this thing Nephthar, which is by interpretation, Cleansing; but most men call it Nephthai. </span>
