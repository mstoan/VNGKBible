<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_1" data-id="C13_1">Brothers, I couldn’t speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_2" data-id="C13_2">I fed you with milk, not with meat; for you weren’t yet ready. Indeed, not even now are you ready,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_3" data-id="C13_3">for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren’t you fleshly, and don’t you walk in the ways of men? </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_4" data-id="C13_4">For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” aren’t you fleshly?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_5" data-id="C13_5">Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed; and each as the Lord gave to him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_6" data-id="C13_6">I planted. Apollos watered. But God gave the increase.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_7" data-id="C13_7">So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_8" data-id="C13_8">Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_9" data-id="C13_9">For we are God’s fellow workers. You are God’s farming, God’s building.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_10" data-id="C13_10">According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_11" data-id="C13_11">For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_12" data-id="C13_12">But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or stubble;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_13" data-id="C13_13">each man’s work will be revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man’s work is. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_14" data-id="C13_14">If any man’s work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_15" data-id="C13_15">If any man’s work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_16" data-id="C13_16">Don’t you know that you are a temple of God, and that God’s Spirit lives in you?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_17" data-id="C13_17">If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is holy, which you are.</span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_18" data-id="C13_18">Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_19" data-id="C13_19">For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, “He has taken the wise in their craftiness.”<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Job 5:13</span></span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_20" data-id="C13_20">And again, “The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless.”<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Psalm 94:11</span></span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_21" data-id="C13_21">Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_22" data-id="C13_22">whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours, </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_23" data-id="C13_23">and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.</span>
