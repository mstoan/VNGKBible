<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK42_3" data-id="EK42_3">Over against the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner court, and over against the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in the third floor. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK42_4" data-id="EK42_4">Before the rooms was a walk of ten cubits’ width inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK42_5" data-id="EK42_5">Now the upper rooms were shorter; for the galleries took away from these, more than from the lower and the middle, in the building. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK42_6" data-id="EK42_6">For they were in three stories, and they didn’t have pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the uppermost was set back more than the lowest and the middle from the ground. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK42_7" data-id="EK42_7">The wall that was outside by the side of the rooms, toward the outer court before the rooms, its length was fifty cubits.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK42_11" data-id="EK42_11">The way before them was like the appearance of the rooms which were toward the north; according to their length so was their width: and all their exits were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK42_12" data-id="EK42_12">According to the doors of the rooms that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one enters into them. </span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK42_13" data-id="EK42_13">Then he said to me, The north rooms and the south rooms, which are before the separate place, they are the holy rooms, where the priests who are near to Yahweh shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meal offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK42_14" data-id="EK42_14">When the priests enter in, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments in which they minister; for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and shall approach to that which is for the people. </span>
