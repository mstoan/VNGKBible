<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_4" data-id="GN19_4">But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_5" data-id="GN19_5">They called to Lot, and said to him, “Where are the men who came in to you this night? Bring them out to us, that we may have sex with them.” </span>

<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_30" data-id="GN19_30">Lot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to live in Zoar. He lived in a cave with his two daughters. </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN19_31" data-id="GN19_31">The firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us in the way of all the earth. </span>
