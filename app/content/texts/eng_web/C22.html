<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_1" data-id="C22_1">But I determined this for myself, that I would not come to you again in sorrow.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_2" data-id="C22_2">For if I make you sorry, then who will make me glad but he who is made sorry by me?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_3" data-id="C22_3">And I wrote this very thing to you, so that, when I came, I wouldn’t have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy would be shared by all of you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_4" data-id="C22_4">For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be made sorry, but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_5" data-id="C22_5">But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I not press too heavily) to you all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_6" data-id="C22_6">This punishment which was inflicted by the many is sufficient for such a one;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_7" data-id="C22_7">so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_8" data-id="C22_8">Therefore I beg you to confirm your love toward him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_9" data-id="C22_9">For to this end I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_10" data-id="C22_10">Now I also forgive whomever you forgive anything. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ, </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_11" data-id="C22_11">that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_12" data-id="C22_12">Now when I came to Troas for the Good News of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_13" data-id="C22_13">I had no relief for my spirit, because I didn’t find Titus, my brother, but taking my leave of them, I went out into Macedonia. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_14" data-id="C22_14">Now thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_15" data-id="C22_15">For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God, in those who are saved, and in those who perish;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_16" data-id="C22_16">to the one a stench from death to death; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things? </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_17" data-id="C22_17">For we are not as so many, peddling the word of God. But as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ. </span>
