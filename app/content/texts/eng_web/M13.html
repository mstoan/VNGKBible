<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v M13_3" data-id="M13_3">And he got his people great glory, and put on a breastplate as a giant, and girded his warlike harness about him, and set battles in array, protecting the army with his sword. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v M13_4" data-id="M13_4">And he was like a lion in his deeds, and as a lion’s whelp roaring for prey.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v M13_5" data-id="M13_5">And he pursued the lawless, seeking them out, and he burned up those that troubled his people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v M13_6" data-id="M13_6">And the lawless shrunk for fear of him, and all the workers of lawlessness were sore troubled, and salvation prospered in his hand. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v M13_7" data-id="M13_7">And he angered many kings, and made Jacob glad with his acts, and his memorial is blessed for ever.</span>
