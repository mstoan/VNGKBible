<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v M13_2" data-id="M13_2">And all his brethren helped him, and so did all they that clave to his father, and they fought with gladness the battle of Israel. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v M13_3" data-id="M13_3">And he got his people great glory, and put on a breastplate as a giant, and girded his warlike harness about him, and set battles in array, protecting the army with his sword. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v M13_4" data-id="M13_4">And he was like a lion in his deeds, and as a lion’s whelp roaring for prey.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v M13_5" data-id="M13_5">And he pursued the lawless, seeking them out, and he burned up those that troubled his people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v M13_6" data-id="M13_6">And the lawless shrunk for fear of him, and all the workers of lawlessness were sore troubled, and salvation prospered in his hand. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v M13_7" data-id="M13_7">And he angered many kings, and made Jacob glad with his acts, and his memorial is blessed for ever.</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v M13_9" data-id="M13_9">and he was renowned to the utmost part of the earth, and he gathered together such as were ready to perish.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v M13_10" data-id="M13_10">And Apollonius gathered the Gentiles together, and a great host from Samaria, to fight against Israel.</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v M13_12" data-id="M13_12">And they took their spoils, and Judas took the sword of Apollonius, and therewith he fought all his days.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v M13_15" data-id="M13_15">And there went up with him also a mighty army of the ungodly to help him, to take vengeance on the children of Israel.</span>

<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v M13_28" data-id="M13_28">And he opened his treasury, and gave his forces pay for a year, and commanded them to be ready for every need.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v M13_29" data-id="M13_29">And he saw that the money failed from his treasures, and that the tributes of the country were small, because of the dissension and plague which he had brought upon the land, to the end that he might take away the laws which had been from the first days; </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v M13_30" data-id="M13_30">and he feared that he should not have enough as at other times for the charges and the gifts which he gave aforetime with a liberal hand, and he abounded above the kings that were before him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v M13_31" data-id="M13_31">And he was exceedingly perplexed in his mind, and he determined to go into Persia, and to take the tributes of the countries, and to gather much money. </span>

<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v M13_43" data-id="M13_43">and they said each man to his neighbor, Let us raise up the ruin of our people, and let us fight for our people and the holy place. </span>

<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v M13_45" data-id="M13_45">And Jerusalem was without inhabitant as a wilderness, there was none of her offspring that went in or went out; and the sanctuary was trodden down, and the sons of strangers were in the citadel, the Gentiles lodged therein; and joy was taken away from Jacob, and the pipe and the harp ceased. </span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v M13_46" data-id="M13_46">And they gathered themselves together, and came to Mizpeh, over against Jerusalem; for in Mizpeh was there a place of prayer aforetime for Israel. </span>

<span class="v-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span><span class="v M13_58" data-id="M13_58">And Judas said, Gird yourselves, and be valiant men, and be in readiness against the morning, that you⌃ may fight with these Gentiles, that are assembled together against us to destroy us, and our holy place:</span>
<span class="v-num v-59">59&nbsp;</span><span class="v M13_59" data-id="M13_59">for it is better for us to die in battle, than to look upon the evils of our nation and the holy place.</span>
