<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R234_4" data-id="R234_4">They broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence; and he cut down the incense altars that were on high above them.

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v R234_13" data-id="R234_13">Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and directed all who did the work in every kind of service. Of the Levites, there were scribes, officials, and porters. </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v R234_19" data-id="R234_19">When the king had heard the words of the law, he tore his clothes.</span>

<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v R234_21" data-id="R234_21">“Go inquire of Yahweh for me, and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is Yahweh’s wrath that is poured out on us, because our fathers have not kept Yahweh’s word, to do according to all that is written in this book.” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v R234_22" data-id="R234_22">So Hilkiah, and they whom the king had commanded, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter), and they spoke to her to that effect. </span>

<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v R234_23" data-id="R234_23">She said to them, “Yahweh, the God of Israel says: ‘Tell the man who sent you to me,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v R234_24" data-id="R234_24">“Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on its inhabitants, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v R234_25" data-id="R234_25">Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath is poured out on this place, and it will not be quenched.’”’</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v R234_26" data-id="R234_26">But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Yahweh, you shall tell him this, ‘Yahweh, the God of Israel says: “About the words which you have heard, </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v R234_27" data-id="R234_27">because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before God, when you heard his words against this place, and against its inhabitants, and have humbled yourself before me, and have torn your clothes, and wept before me, I also have heard you,” says Yahweh. </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v R234_28" data-id="R234_28">“Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace. Your eyes won’t see all the evil that I will bring on this place and on its inhabitants.”’” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v R234_28" data-id="R234_28">They brought back word to the king.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v R234_29" data-id="R234_29">Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v R234_30" data-id="R234_30">The king went up to Yahweh’s house, with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests, the Levites, and all the people, both great and small; and he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in Yahweh’s house. </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v R234_31" data-id="R234_31">The king stood in his place, and made a covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book. </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v R234_32" data-id="R234_32">He caused all who were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand. The inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers. </span>
