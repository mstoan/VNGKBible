<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_2" data-id="JN7_2">Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_3" data-id="JN7_3">His brothers therefore said to him, “Depart from here, and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_4" data-id="JN7_4">For no one does anything in secret, and himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world.” </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_5" data-id="JN7_5">For even his brothers didn’t believe in him.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_6" data-id="JN7_6">Jesus therefore said to them, <span class="wj woj">“My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready. </span> </span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_11" data-id="JN7_11">The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, “Where is he?”</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_12" data-id="JN7_12">There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, “He is a good man.” Others said, “Not so, but he leads the multitude astray.” </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_13" data-id="JN7_13">Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.</span>

<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_26" data-id="JN7_26">Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ? </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_27" data-id="JN7_27">However we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.”</span>

<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_31" data-id="JN7_31">But of the multitude, many believed in him. They said, “When the Christ comes, he won’t do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?” </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_32" data-id="JN7_32">The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him. </span>

<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_35" data-id="JN7_35">The Jews therefore said among themselves, “Where will this man go that we won’t find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? </span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_36" data-id="JN7_36">What is this word that he said, <span class="wj woj">‘You will seek me, and won’t find me; and where I am, you can’t come’</span>?” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_37" data-id="JN7_37">Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, <span class="wj woj">“If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink! </span> </span>

<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_39" data-id="JN7_39">But he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn’t yet glorified. </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_40" data-id="JN7_40">Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, “This is truly the prophet.”</span>
