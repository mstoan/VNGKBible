<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v E27_1" data-id="E27_1">And when I had made an end of speaking these words, there was sent to me the angel which had been sent to me the nights before: </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v E27_2" data-id="E27_2">and he said to me, Up, Esdras, and hear the words that I am come to tell you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v E27_3" data-id="E27_3">And I said, Speak on, my Lord. Then he said to me, There is a sea set in a wide place, that it might be <span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2"></a></span><span class="note" id="note-3"><a class="key" href="#footnote-3">So</a></span><span class="note" id="note-4"><a class="key" href="#footnote-4"></a></span> broad and vast. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v E27_4" data-id="E27_4">But the entrance thereof shall be set in a narrow place so as to be like a river;</span>

<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v E27_6" data-id="E27_6">Another thing also: There is a city builded and set in a plain country, and full of all good things;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v E27_7" data-id="E27_7">but the entrance thereof is narrow, and is set in a dangerous place to fall, having a fire on the right hand, and on the left a deep water: </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v E27_8" data-id="E27_8">and there is one only path between them both, even between the fire and the water, <span class="add">so small </span> that there could but one man go there at once.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v E27_9" data-id="E27_9">If this city now be given to a man for an inheritance, if the heir pass not the danger before him, how shall he receive his inheritance? </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v E27_10" data-id="E27_10">And I said, It is so, Lord. Then said he to me, Even so also is Israel’s portion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v E27_11" data-id="E27_11">Because for their sakes I made the world: and when Adam transgressed my statutes, then was decreed that now is done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v E27_12" data-id="E27_12">Then were the entrances of this world made narrow, and sorrowful and toilsome: they are but few and evil, full of perils, and charged with great toils. </span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v E27_22" data-id="E27_22">Nevertheless they were not obedient to him; but spoke against him, and imagined for themselves vain things;</span>
