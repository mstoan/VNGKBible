<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_4" data-id="JN13_4">arose from supper, and laid aside his outer garments. He took a towel, and wrapped a towel around his waist.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_5" data-id="JN13_5">Then he poured water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_6" data-id="JN13_6">Then he came to Simon Peter. He said to him, “Lord, do you wash my feet?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN13_7" data-id="JN13_7">Jesus answered him, <span class="wj woj">“You don’t know what I am doing now, but you will understand later.”</span> </span>
