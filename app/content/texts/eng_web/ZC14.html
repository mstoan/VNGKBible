<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC14_5" data-id="ZC14_5">You shall flee by the valley of my mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azel; yes, you shall flee, just like you fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah.

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC14_12" data-id="ZC14_12">This will be the plague with which Yahweh will strike all the peoples who have fought against Jerusalem: their flesh will consume away while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will consume away in their sockets, and their tongue will consume away in their mouth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC14_13" data-id="ZC14_13">It will happen in that day, that a great panic from Yahweh will be among them; and they will lay hold everyone on the hand of his neighbor, and his hand will rise up against the hand of his neighbor.</span>
