<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_2" data-id="TT3_2">to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_3" data-id="TT3_3">For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_4" data-id="TT3_4">But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_5" data-id="TT3_5">not by works of righteousness which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit, </span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_9" data-id="TT3_9">but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</span>
