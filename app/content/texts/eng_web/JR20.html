<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR20_1" data-id="JR20_1">Now Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in Yahweh’s house, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR20_2" data-id="JR20_2">Then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in Yahweh’s house. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR20_3" data-id="JR20_3">On the next day, Pashhur released Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him, “Yahweh has not called your name Pashhur, but Magormissabib. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR20_4" data-id="JR20_4">For Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself, and to all your friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes shall see it; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall kill them with the sword.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR20_5" data-id="JR20_5">Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all its gains, and all the precious things of it, yes, all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies; and they shall make them captives, and take them, and carry them to Babylon. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR20_6" data-id="JR20_6">You, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house shall go into captivity; and you shall come to Babylon, and there you shall die, and there you shall be buried, you, and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied falsely.’”</span>
