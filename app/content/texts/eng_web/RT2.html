<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT2_1" data-id="RT2_1">Naomi had a relative of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT2_2" data-id="RT2_2">Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I find favor.” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v RT2_2" data-id="RT2_2">She said to her, “Go, my daughter.”</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT2_3" data-id="RT2_3">She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT2_4" data-id="RT2_4">Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, “May Yahweh be with you.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v RT2_4" data-id="RT2_4">They answered him, “May Yahweh bless you.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT2_5" data-id="RT2_5">Then Boaz said to his servant who was set over the reapers, “Whose young lady is this?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT2_6" data-id="RT2_6">The servant who was set over the reapers answered, “It is the Moabite lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT2_7" data-id="RT2_7">She said, ‘Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.’ So she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she rested a little in the house.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT2_8" data-id="RT2_8">Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Don’t go to glean in another field, and don’t go from here, but stay here close to my maidens. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT2_9" data-id="RT2_9">Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them. Haven’t I commanded the young men not to touch you? When you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink from that which the young men have drawn.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT2_10" data-id="RT2_10">Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, since I am a foreigner?” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT2_11" data-id="RT2_11">Boaz answered her, “I have been fully told about all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you have left your father and your mother, and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you didn’t know before. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT2_12" data-id="RT2_12">May Yahweh repay your work, and a full reward be given to you from Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT2_13" data-id="RT2_13">Then she said, “Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly to your servant, though I am not as one of your servants.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT2_14" data-id="RT2_14">At meal time Boaz said to her, “Come here, and eat some bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v RT2_14" data-id="RT2_14">She sat beside the reapers, and they passed her parched grain, and she ate, and was satisfied, and left some of it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT2_15" data-id="RT2_15">When she had risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and don’t reproach her. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT2_16" data-id="RT2_16">Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it. Let her glean, and don’t rebuke her.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT2_17" data-id="RT2_17">So she gleaned in the field until evening; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah<span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> of barley.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT2_18" data-id="RT2_18">She took it up, and went into the city. Then her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned; and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she had enough. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT2_19" data-id="RT2_19">Her mother-in-law said to her, “Where have you gleaned today? Where have you worked? Blessed be he who noticed you.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v RT2_19" data-id="RT2_19">She told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, “The man’s name with whom I worked today is Boaz.”</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT2_20" data-id="RT2_20">Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be blessed by Yahweh, who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead.” Naomi said to her, “The man is a close relative to us, one of our near kinsmen.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT2_21" data-id="RT2_21">Ruth the Moabitess said, “Yes, he said to me, ‘You shall stay close to my young men, until they have finished all my harvest.’” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT2_22" data-id="RT2_22">Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you in any other field.” </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT2_23" data-id="RT2_23">So she stayed close to the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived with her mother-in-law. </span>
