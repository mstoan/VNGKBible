<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_1" data-id="EC5_1">Guard your steps when you go to God’s house; for to draw near to listen is better than to give the sacrifice of fools, for they don’t know that they do evil. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_2" data-id="EC5_2">Don’t be rash with your mouth, and don’t let your heart be hasty to utter anything before God; for God is in heaven, and you on earth. Therefore let your words be few. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_3" data-id="EC5_3">For as a dream comes with a multitude of cares, so a fool’s speech with a multitude of words.</span>

<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_6" data-id="EC5_6">Don’t allow your mouth to lead you into sin. Don’t protest before the messenger that this was a mistake. Why should God be angry at your voice, and destroy the work of your hands? </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_7" data-id="EC5_7">For in the multitude of dreams there are vanities, as well as in many words: but you must fear God.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_14" data-id="EC5_14">Those riches perish by misfortune, and if he has fathered a son, there is nothing in his hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_15" data-id="EC5_15">As he came out of his mother’s womb, naked shall he go again as he came, and shall take nothing for his labor, which he may carry away in his hand. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_16" data-id="EC5_16">This also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go. And what profit does he have who labors for the wind? </span>
