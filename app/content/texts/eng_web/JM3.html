<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_1" data-id="JM3_1">Let not many of you be teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier judgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_2" data-id="JM3_2">For in many things we all stumble. If anyone doesn’t stumble in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_3" data-id="JM3_3">Indeed, we put bits into the horses’ mouths so that they may obey us, and we guide their whole body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_4" data-id="JM3_4">Behold,<span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> the ships also, though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds, are yet guided by a very small rudder, wherever the pilot desires. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_5" data-id="JM3_5">So the tongue is also a little member, and boasts great things. See how a small fire can spread to a large forest!</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_6" data-id="JM3_6">And the tongue is a fire. The world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by Gehenna.<span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_7" data-id="JM3_7">For every kind of animal, bird, creeping thing, and sea creature, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_8" data-id="JM3_8">but nobody can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_9" data-id="JM3_9">With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who are made in the image of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_10" data-id="JM3_10">Out of the same mouth comes blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_11" data-id="JM3_11">Does a spring send out from the same opening fresh and bitter water?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_12" data-id="JM3_12">Can a fig tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh water.</span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_13" data-id="JM3_13">Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_14" data-id="JM3_14">But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, don’t boast and don’t lie against the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_15" data-id="JM3_15">This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and demonic.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_16" data-id="JM3_16">For where jealousy and selfish ambition are, there is confusion and every evil deed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_17" data-id="JM3_17">But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_18" data-id="JM3_18">Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.</span>
