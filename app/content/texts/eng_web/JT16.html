<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT16_18" data-id="JT16_18">Now when they came to Jerusalem, they worshipped God; and when the people were purified, they offered their whole burnt offerings, and their free will offerings, and their gifts. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT16_19" data-id="JT16_19">And Judith dedicated all the stuff of Holofernes, which the people had given her, and gave the canopy, which she had taken for herself out of his bedchamber, for a gift to the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT16_20" data-id="JT16_20">And the people continued feasting in Jerusalem before the sanctuary for the space of three months, and Judith remained with them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT16_21" data-id="JT16_21">But after these days every one departed to his own inheritance, and Judith went away to Bethulia, and remained in her own possession, and was honorable in her time in all the land. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT16_22" data-id="JT16_22">And many desired her, and no man knew her all the days of her life, from the day that Manasses her husband died and was gathered to his people. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT16_23" data-id="JT16_23">And she increased in greatness exceedingly; and she waxed old in her husband’s house, to a hundred and five years, and let her maid go free: and she died in Bethulia; and they buried her in the cave of her husband Manasses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT16_24" data-id="JT16_24">And the house of Israel mourned for her seven days: and she distributed her goods before she died to all them that were nearest of kin to Manasses her husband, and to them that were nearest of her own kindred.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT16_25" data-id="JT16_25">And there was none that made the children of Israel any more afraid in the days of Judith, nor a long time after her death. </span>
