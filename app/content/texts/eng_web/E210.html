<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v E210_3" data-id="E210_3">And it came to pass, when they had all left off to comfort me, to the end I might be quiet, then rose I up by night, and fled, and came hither into this field, as you see. </span>

<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v E210_21" data-id="E210_21">For you see that our sanctuary is laid waste, our altar broken down, our temple destroyed;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v E210_22" data-id="E210_22">our lute is brought low, our song is put to silence, our rejoicing is at an end; the light of our candlestick is put out, the ark of our covenant is spoiled, our holy things are defiled, and the name that is called upon us is profaned; our freemen are despitefully treated, our priests are burned, our Levites are gone into captivity, our virgins are defiled, and our wives ravished; our righteous men carried away, our little ones betrayed, our young men are brought into bondage, and our strong men are become weak; </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v E210_23" data-id="E210_23">and, what is more than all, the seal of Sion—for she has now lost the seal of her honor, and is delivered into the hands of them that hate us. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v E210_24" data-id="E210_24">You therefore shake off your great heaviness, and put away from you the multitude of sorrows, that the Mighty may be merciful to you again, and the Most High may give you rest, even ease from your travails.</span>

<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v E210_48" data-id="E210_48">And whereas she said to you, My son coming into his marriage chamber died, and that misfortune befell her: this was the destruction that came to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v E210_49" data-id="E210_49">And, behold, you saw her likeness, how she mourned for her son, and you began to comfort her for what has befallen her; <span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2"></a></span><span class="note" id="note-3"><a class="key" href="#footnote-3">Omitted</a></span> these were the things to be opened to you.</span>

<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v E210_51" data-id="E210_51">and therefore I bade you remain in the field where no house was builded:</span>

<span class="v-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v E210_56" data-id="E210_56">and then shall you hear as much as your ears may comprehend.</span>
<span class="v-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v E210_57" data-id="E210_57">For you are blessed above many, and with the Most High are called by name, like as but few.</span>
