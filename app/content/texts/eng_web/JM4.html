<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_1" data-id="JM4_1">Where do wars and fightings among you come from? Don’t they come from your pleasures that war in your members?</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_2" data-id="JM4_2">You lust, and don’t have. You murder and covet, and can’t obtain. You fight and make war. You don’t have, because you don’t ask. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_3" data-id="JM4_3">You ask, and don’t receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it for your pleasures.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_4" data-id="JM4_4">You adulterers and adulteresses, don’t you know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_5" data-id="JM4_5">Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, “The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously”?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_6" data-id="JM4_6">But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Proverbs 3:34</span></span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_7" data-id="JM4_7">Be subject therefore to God. But resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_8" data-id="JM4_8">Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_9" data-id="JM4_9">Lament, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to gloom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_10" data-id="JM4_10">Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_11" data-id="JM4_11">Don’t speak against one another, brothers. He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_12" data-id="JM4_12">Only one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge another?</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_14" data-id="JM4_14">Whereas you don’t know what your life will be like tomorrow. For what is your life? For you are a vapor, that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_15" data-id="JM4_15">For you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will both live, and do this or that.”</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_16" data-id="JM4_16">But now you glory in your boasting. All such boasting is evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_17" data-id="JM4_17">To him therefore who knows to do good, and doesn’t do it, to him it is sin.</span>
