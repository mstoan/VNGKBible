<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v K21_4" data-id="K21_4">Now therefore Yahweh says, “You will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.”’” Then Elijah departed. </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v K21_13" data-id="K21_13">Again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty.

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v K21_14" data-id="K21_14">Behold, fire came down from the sky, and consumed the last two captains of fifty with their fifties. But now let my life be precious in your sight.” </span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v K21_16" data-id="K21_16">He said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word?
