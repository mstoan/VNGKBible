<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_1" data-id="JR11_1">The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_2" data-id="JR11_2">“Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_3" data-id="JR11_3">and say to them, Yahweh, the God of Israel says: ‘Cursed is the man who doesn’t hear the words of this covenant,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_4" data-id="JR11_4">which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace,’ saying, ‘Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so you shall be my people, and I will be your God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_5" data-id="JR11_5">that I may establish the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey,’ as it is today.” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v JR11_5" data-id="JR11_5">Then answered I, and said, “Amen, Yahweh.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_6" data-id="JR11_6">Yahweh said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Hear the words of this covenant, and do them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_7" data-id="JR11_7">For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising early and protesting, saying, “Obey my voice.” </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_8" data-id="JR11_8">Yet they didn’t obey, nor turn their ear, but walked everyone in the stubbornness of their evil heart: therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they didn’t do them.’”</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_9" data-id="JR11_9">Yahweh said to me, “A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_11" data-id="JR11_11">Therefore Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will bring evil on them, which they shall not be able to escape; and they shall cry to me, but I will not listen to them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_12" data-id="JR11_12">Then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense: but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR11_13" data-id="JR11_13">For according to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.’</span>
