<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX32_5" data-id="EX32_5">When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation, and said, “Tomorrow shall be a feast to Yahweh.” </span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX32_12" data-id="EX32_12">Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, ‘He brought them out for evil, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the surface of the earth?’ Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX32_13" data-id="EX32_13">Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, ‘I will multiply your offspring<span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> as the stars of the sky, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your offspring,<span class="note" id="note-3"><a class="key" href="#footnote-3">+</a></span> and they shall inherit it forever.’” </span>
