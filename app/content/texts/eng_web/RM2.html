<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_1" data-id="RM2_1">Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are who judge. For in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge practice the same things. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_2" data-id="RM2_2">We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_3" data-id="RM2_3">Do you think this, O man who judges those who practice such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God? </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_4" data-id="RM2_4">Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance? </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_5" data-id="RM2_5">But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God; </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_6" data-id="RM2_6">who “will pay back to everyone according to their works:”<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Psalm 62:12; Proverbs 24:12</span></span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_7" data-id="RM2_7">to those who by perseverance in well-doing seek for glory, honor, and incorruptibility, eternal life;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_8" data-id="RM2_8">but to those who are self-seeking, and don’t obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath and indignation,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_9" data-id="RM2_9">oppression and anguish, on every soul of man who does evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_10" data-id="RM2_10">But glory, honor, and peace go to every man who does good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_11" data-id="RM2_11">For there is no partiality with God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_12" data-id="RM2_12">For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without the law. As many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_13" data-id="RM2_13">For it isn’t the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_14" data-id="RM2_14">(for when Gentiles who don’t have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law to themselves, </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_15" data-id="RM2_15">in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them) </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_16" data-id="RM2_16">in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my Good News, by Jesus Christ.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_17" data-id="RM2_17">Indeed you bear the name of a Jew, and rest on the law, and glory in God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_18" data-id="RM2_18">and know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_19" data-id="RM2_19">and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_20" data-id="RM2_20">a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_21" data-id="RM2_21">You therefore who teach another, don’t you teach yourself? You who preach that a man shouldn’t steal, do you steal?</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_22" data-id="RM2_22">You who say a man shouldn’t commit adultery. Do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_23" data-id="RM2_23">You who glory in the law, through your disobedience of the law do you dishonor God?</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_24" data-id="RM2_24">For “the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,” <span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Isaiah 52:5; Ezekiel 36:22</span></span> just as it is written. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_25" data-id="RM2_25">For circumcision indeed profits, if you are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_26" data-id="RM2_26">If therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law, won’t his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision?</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_27" data-id="RM2_27">Won’t the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law? </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_28" data-id="RM2_28">For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh;</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_29" data-id="RM2_29">but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God. </span>
