<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS23_2" data-id="IS23_2">Be still, you inhabitants of the coast, you whom the merchants of Sidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS23_3" data-id="IS23_3">On great waters, the seed of the Shihor, the harvest of the Nile, was her revenue. She was the market of nations.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS23_4" data-id="IS23_4">Be ashamed, Sidon; for the sea has spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying, “I have not travailed, nor given birth, neither have I nourished young men, nor brought up virgins.” </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS23_5" data-id="IS23_5">When the report comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish at the report of Tyre.</span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS23_13" data-id="IS23_13">Behold, the land of the Chaldeans. This people was not. The Assyrians founded it for those who dwell in the wilderness. They set up their towers. They overthrew its palaces. They made it a ruin.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS23_16" data-id="IS23_16">Take a harp; go about the city, you prostitute that has been forgotten. Make sweet melody. Sing many songs, that you may be remembered. </span>
