<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS22_2" data-id="IS22_2">You that are full of shouting, a tumultuous city, a joyous town; your slain are not slain with the sword, neither are they dead in battle. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS22_3" data-id="IS22_3">All your rulers fled away together. They were bound by the archers. All who were found by you were bound together. They fled far away. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS22_4" data-id="IS22_4">Therefore I said, “Look away from me. I will weep bitterly. Don’t labor to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS22_5" data-id="IS22_5">For it is a day of confusion, and of treading down, and of perplexity, from the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, in the valley of vision; a breaking down of the walls, and a crying to the mountains.”</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS22_6" data-id="IS22_6">Elam carried his quiver, with chariots of men and horsemen; and Kir uncovered the shield.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS22_7" data-id="IS22_7">Your choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS22_8" data-id="IS22_8">He took away the covering of Judah; and you looked in that day to the armor in the house of the forest.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS22_11" data-id="IS22_11">You also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you didn’t look to him who had done this, neither did you have respect for him who purposed it long ago.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS22_12" data-id="IS22_12">In that day, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, called to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to dressing in sackcloth: </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS22_13" data-id="IS22_13">and behold, joy and gladness, killing cattle and killing sheep, eating meat and drinking wine: “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die.” </span>
