<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S121_2" data-id="S121_2">David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has commanded me to do something, and has said to me, ‘Let no one know anything about the business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you. I have sent the young men to a certain place.’ </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S121_3" data-id="S121_3">Now therefore what is under your hand? Please give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever is available.”</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S121_4" data-id="S121_4">The priest answered David, and said, “I have no common bread, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.” </span>

<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S121_5" data-id="S121_5">David answered the priest, and said to him, “Truly, women have been kept from us as usual these three days. When I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was only a common journey. How much more then today shall their vessels be holy?” </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S121_6" data-id="S121_6">So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the show bread that was taken from before Yahweh, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away. </span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S121_7" data-id="S121_7">Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Yahweh; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S121_8" data-id="S121_8">David said to Ahimelech, “Isn’t there here under your hand spear or sword? For I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S121_9" data-id="S121_9">The priest said, “Behold, the sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod.

<div class="p">
<span class="v S121_9" data-id="S121_9">David said, “There is none like that. Give it to me.”</span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S121_10" data-id="S121_10">David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S121_11" data-id="S121_11">The servants of Achish said to him, “Isn’t this David the king of the land? Didn’t they sing to one another about him in dances, saying, </span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S121_14" data-id="S121_14">Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, you see the man is insane. Why then have you brought him to me?</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v S121_15" data-id="S121_15">Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Should this fellow come into my house?” </span>
