<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R128_2" data-id="R128_2">Then David the king stood up on his feet, and said, “Hear me, my brothers, and my people!

<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R128_3" data-id="R128_3">But God said to me, ‘You shall not build a house for my name, because you are a man of war, and have shed blood.’</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R128_4" data-id="R128_4">However Yahweh, the God of Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever.

<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R128_5" data-id="R128_5">Of all my sons (for Yahweh has given me many sons), he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of Yahweh’s kingdom over Israel. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R128_6" data-id="R128_6">He said to me, ‘Solomon, your son, shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R128_7" data-id="R128_7">I will establish his kingdom forever if he continues to do my commandments and my ordinances, as it is today.’</span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R128_8" data-id="R128_8">Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, Yahweh’s assembly, and in the audience of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of Yahweh your God; that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you forever. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v R128_9" data-id="R128_9">You, Solomon my son, know the God of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for Yahweh searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever. </span>
