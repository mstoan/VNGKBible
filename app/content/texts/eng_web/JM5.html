<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_3" data-id="JM5_3">Your gold and your silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be for a testimony against you, and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up your treasure in the last days. </span>

<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_5" data-id="JM5_5">You have lived delicately on the earth, and taken your pleasure. You have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_15" data-id="JM5_15">and the prayer of faith will heal him who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. If he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM5_16" data-id="JM5_16">Confess your offenses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The insistent prayer of a righteous person is powerfully effective. </span>
