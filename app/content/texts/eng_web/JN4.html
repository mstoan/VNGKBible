<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_4" data-id="JN4_4">He needed to pass through Samaria.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_5" data-id="JN4_5">So he came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son, Joseph.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_6" data-id="JN4_6">Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.<span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_7" data-id="JN4_7">A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, <span class="wj woj">“Give me a drink.”</span> </span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_9" data-id="JN4_9">The Samaritan woman therefore said to him, “How is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.) </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_10" data-id="JN4_10">Jesus answered her, <span class="wj woj">“If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”</span> </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_11" data-id="JN4_11">The woman said to him, “Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. So where do you get that living water?</span>

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_21" data-id="JN4_21">Jesus said to her, <span class="wj woj">“Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father. </span> </span>

<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_26" data-id="JN4_26">Jesus said to her, <span class="wj woj">“I am he, the one who speaks to you.”</span></span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_27" data-id="JN4_27">At this, his disciples came. They marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, “What are you looking for?” or, “Why do you speak with her?” </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_28" data-id="JN4_28">So the woman left her water pot, and went away into the city, and said to the people,</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_29" data-id="JN4_29">“Come, see a man who told me everything that I did. Can this be the Christ?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_30" data-id="JN4_30">They went out of the city, and were coming to him.</span>

<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_34" data-id="JN4_34">Jesus said to them, <span class="wj woj">“My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work. </span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_35" data-id="JN4_35"> <span class="wj woj">Don’t you say, ‘There are yet four months until the harvest?’ Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already. </span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_36" data-id="JN4_36"> <span class="wj woj">He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life; that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together. </span> </span>

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_39" data-id="JN4_39">From that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman, who testified, “He told me everything that I did.” </span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_40" data-id="JN4_40">So when the Samaritans came to him, they begged him to stay with them. He stayed there two days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_41" data-id="JN4_41">Many more believed because of his word.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_42" data-id="JN4_42">They said to the woman, “Now we believe, not because of your speaking; for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_43" data-id="JN4_43">After the two days he went out from there and went into Galilee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_44" data-id="JN4_44">For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_45" data-id="JN4_45">So when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast. </span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_46" data-id="JN4_46">Jesus came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water into wine. There was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum. </span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_47" data-id="JN4_47">When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and begged him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. </span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_48" data-id="JN4_48">Jesus therefore said to him, <span class="wj woj">“Unless you see signs and wonders, you will in no way believe.”</span> </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_49" data-id="JN4_49">The nobleman said to him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.”</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_50" data-id="JN4_50">Jesus said to him, <span class="wj woj">“Go your way. Your son lives.”</span> The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way. </span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_51" data-id="JN4_51">As he was now going down, his servants met him and reported, saying “Your child lives!”</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_52" data-id="JN4_52">So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. They said therefore to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour,<span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> the fever left him.” </span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_53" data-id="JN4_53">So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, <span class="wj woj">“Your son lives.”</span> He believed, as did his whole house. </span>
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_54" data-id="JN4_54">This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.</span>
