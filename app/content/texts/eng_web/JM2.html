<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_1" data-id="JM2_1">My brothers, don’t hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with partiality.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_2" data-id="JM2_2">For if a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, comes into your synagogue,<span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> and a poor man in filthy clothing also comes in;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_3" data-id="JM2_3">and you pay special attention to him who wears the fine clothing, and say, “Sit here in a good place”; and you tell the poor man, “Stand there,” or “Sit by my footstool”; </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_4" data-id="JM2_4">haven’t you shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_5" data-id="JM2_5">Listen, my beloved brothers. Didn’t God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him? </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_6" data-id="JM2_6">But you have dishonored the poor man. Don’t the rich oppress you, and personally drag you before the courts?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_7" data-id="JM2_7">Don’t they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_8" data-id="JM2_8">However, if you fulfill the royal law, according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,”<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Leviticus 19:18</span></span> you do well. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_9" data-id="JM2_9">But if you show partiality, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_10" data-id="JM2_10">For whoever keeps the whole law, and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_11" data-id="JM2_11">For he who said, “Do not commit adultery,”<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Exodus 20:14; Deuteronomy 5:18</span></span> also said, “Do not commit murder.”<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Exodus 10:13; Deuteronomy 5:17</span></span> Now if you do not commit adultery, but murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_12" data-id="JM2_12">So speak, and so do, as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_13" data-id="JM2_13">For judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_14" data-id="JM2_14">What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but has no works? Can faith save him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_15" data-id="JM2_15">And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_16" data-id="JM2_16">and one of you tells them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled”; and yet you didn’t give them the things the body needs, what good is it? </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_17" data-id="JM2_17">Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_18" data-id="JM2_18">Yes, a man will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without works, and I by my works will show you my faith. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_19" data-id="JM2_19">You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also believe, and shudder.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_20" data-id="JM2_20">But do you want to know, vain man, that faith apart from works is dead?</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_21" data-id="JM2_21">Wasn’t Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_22" data-id="JM2_22">You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was perfected;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_23" data-id="JM2_23">and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness”;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Genesis 15:6</span></span> and he was called the friend of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_24" data-id="JM2_24">You see then that by works, a man is justified, and not only by faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_25" data-id="JM2_25">In the same way, wasn’t Rahab the prostitute also justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way? </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_26" data-id="JM2_26">For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.</span>
