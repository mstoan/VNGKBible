<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB42_7" data-id="JB42_7">It was so, that after Yahweh had spoken these words to Job, Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two friends; for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.
</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB42_8" data-id="JB42_8">Now therefore, take to yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept him, that I not deal with you according to your folly.
 For you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.”

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB42_10" data-id="JB42_10">Yahweh turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends. Yahweh gave Job twice as much as he had before.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB42_11" data-id="JB42_11">Then came there to him all his brothers, and all his sisters, and all those who had been of his acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house. They comforted him, and consoled him concerning all the evil that Yahweh had brought on him.
 Everyone also gave him a piece of money,<span class="note" id="note-1"><a class="key" href="#footnote-1">+</a></span> and everyone a ring of gold. 
</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB42_12" data-id="JB42_12">So Yahweh blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand female donkeys. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB42_13" data-id="JB42_13">He had also seven sons and three daughters.</span>
