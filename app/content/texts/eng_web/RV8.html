<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_3" data-id="RV8_3">Another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer. Much incense was given to him, that he should add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_4" data-id="RV8_4">The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel’s hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_5" data-id="RV8_5">The angel took the censer, and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it on the earth. There followed thunders, sounds, lightnings, and an earthquake. </span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_8" data-id="RV8_8">The second angel sounded, and something like a great burning mountain was thrown into the sea. One third of the sea became blood, </span>
