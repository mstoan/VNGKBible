<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_35" data-id="MK1_35">Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a deserted place, and prayed there. </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_40" data-id="MK1_40">A leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, “If you want to, you can make me clean.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_41" data-id="MK1_41">Being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, <span class="wj woj">“I want to. Be made clean.”</span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_42" data-id="MK1_42">When he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_43" data-id="MK1_43">He strictly warned him, and immediately sent him out,</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_44" data-id="MK1_44">and said to him, <span class="wj woj">“See you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”</span> </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_45" data-id="MK1_45">But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places: and they came to him from everywhere.</span>
