<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_41" data-id="MK1_41">Being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, <span class="wj woj">“I want to. Be made clean.”</span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_42" data-id="MK1_42">When he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.</span>
