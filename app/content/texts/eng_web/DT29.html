<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_24" data-id="DT29_24">even all the nations will say, “Why has Yahweh done thus to this land? What does the heat of this great anger mean?”</span>

<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_25" data-id="DT29_25">Then men will say, “Because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt, </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_26" data-id="DT29_26">and went and served other gods, and worshiped them, gods that they didn’t know, and that he had not given to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_27" data-id="DT29_27">Therefore Yahweh’s anger burned against this land, to bring on it all the curses that are written in this book.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_28" data-id="DT29_28">Yahweh rooted them out of their land in anger, in wrath, and in great indignation, and thrust them into another land, as it is today.” </span>
