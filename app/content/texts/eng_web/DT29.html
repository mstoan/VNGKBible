<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_4" data-id="DT29_4">But Yahweh has not given you a heart to know, eyes to see, and ears to hear, to this day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_5" data-id="DT29_5">I have led you forty years in the wilderness. Your clothes have not grown old on you, and your shoes have not grown old on your feet. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_6" data-id="DT29_6">You have not eaten bread, neither have you drunk wine or strong drink; that you may know that I am Yahweh your God.</span>

<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_20" data-id="DT29_20">Yahweh will not pardon him, but then Yahweh’s anger and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book will fall on him, and Yahweh will blot out his name from under the sky.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_21" data-id="DT29_21">Yahweh will set him apart for evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this book of the law. </span>

<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_23" data-id="DT29_23">and that all of its land is sulfur, salt, and burning, that it is not sown, doesn’t produce, nor does any grass grow in it, like the overthrow of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, which Yahweh overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath;</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_24" data-id="DT29_24">even all the nations will say, “Why has Yahweh done thus to this land? What does the heat of this great anger mean?”</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_25" data-id="DT29_25">Then men will say, “Because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt, </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_26" data-id="DT29_26">and went and served other gods, and worshiped them, gods that they didn’t know, and that he had not given to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_27" data-id="DT29_27">Therefore Yahweh’s anger burned against this land, to bring on it all the curses that are written in this book.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_28" data-id="DT29_28">Yahweh rooted them out of their land in anger, in wrath, and in great indignation, and thrust them into another land, as it is today.” </span>
