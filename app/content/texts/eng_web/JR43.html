<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR43_1" data-id="JR43_1">When Jeremiah had finished speaking to all the people all the words of Yahweh their God, with which Yahweh their God had sent him to them, even all these words, </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR43_2" data-id="JR43_2">then Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men spoke, saying to Jeremiah, “You speak falsely.

<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR43_3" data-id="JR43_3">but Baruch the son of Neriah has turned you against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captive to Babylon.” </span>

<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR43_4" data-id="JR43_4">So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, didn’t obey Yahweh’s voice, to dwell in the land of Judah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR43_5" data-id="JR43_5">But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, who had returned from all the nations where they had been driven, to live in the land of Judah;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR43_6" data-id="JR43_6">the men, and the women, and the children, and the king’s daughters, and every person who Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR43_7" data-id="JR43_7">and they came into the land of Egypt; for they didn’t obey Yahweh’s voice: and they came to Tahpanhes.</span>
