<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v S218_1" data-id="S218_1">David counted the people who were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S218_2" data-id="S218_2">David sent the people out, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the people, “I will also surely go out with you myself.” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S218_3" data-id="S218_3">But the people said, “You shall not go out; for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore now it is better that you are ready to help us out of the city.” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S218_4" data-id="S218_4">The king said to them, “I will do what seems best to you.”</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v S218_4" data-id="S218_4">The king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S218_5" data-id="S218_5">The king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, “Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.” All the people heard when the king commanded all the captains concerning Absalom.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S218_6" data-id="S218_6">So the people went out into the field against Israel; and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S218_7" data-id="S218_7">The people of Israel were struck there before David’s servants, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S218_8" data-id="S218_8">For the battle was there spread over the surface of all the country, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S218_9" data-id="S218_9">Absalom happened to meet David’s servants. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the sky and earth; and the mule that was under him went on. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S218_10" data-id="S218_10">A certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, “Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S218_11" data-id="S218_11">Joab said to the man who told him, “Behold, you saw it, and why didn’t you strike him there to the ground? I would have given you ten pieces of silver, and a sash.” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v S218_12" data-id="S218_12">The man said to Joab, “Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, I still wouldn’t stretch out my hand against the king’s son; for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, ‘Beware that no one touch the young man Absalom.’ </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S218_13" data-id="S218_13">Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there is no matter hidden from the king), then you yourself would have set yourself against me.” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S218_14" data-id="S218_14">Then Joab said, “I’m not going to wait like this with you.” He took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the middle of the oak.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v S218_15" data-id="S218_15">Ten young men who bore Joab’s armor surrounded and struck Absalom, and killed him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v S218_16" data-id="S218_16">Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held the people back.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S218_17" data-id="S218_17">They took Absalom and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones. Then all Israel fled, each to his own tent. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v S218_18" data-id="S218_18">Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar which is in the king’s valley, for he said, “I have no son to keep my name in memory.” He called the pillar after his own name. It is called Absalom’s monument, to this day.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v S218_19" data-id="S218_19">Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, “Let me now run, and carry the king news, how Yahweh has avenged him of his enemies.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v S218_20" data-id="S218_20">Joab said to him, “You must not be the bearer of news today, but you must carry news another day. But today you must carry no news, because the king’s son is dead.” </span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v S218_22" data-id="S218_22">Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said yet again to Joab, “But come what may, please let me also run after the Cushite.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v S218_22" data-id="S218_22">Joab said, “Why do you want to run, my son, since that you will have no reward for the news?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v S218_23" data-id="S218_23">“But come what may,” he said, “I will run.”</span>
