<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT1_4" data-id="JT1_4">and made the gates thereof, even gates that were raised to the height of seventy cubits, and the breadth of them forty cubits, for the going forth of his mighty hosts, and the setting in array of his footmen:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT1_5" data-id="JT1_5">even in those days king Nebuchadnezzar made war with king Arphaxad in the great plain: this plain is in the borders of Ragau. </span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT1_7" data-id="JT1_7">And Nebuchadnezzar king of the Assyrians sent to all that lived in Persia, and to all that lived westward, to those that lived in Cilicia and Damascus and Libanus and Antilibanus, and to all that lived over against the sea coast,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT1_8" data-id="JT1_8">and to those among the nations that were of Carmel and Gilead, and to the higher Galilee and the great plain of Esdraelon,</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT1_12" data-id="JT1_12">And Nebuchadnezzar was exceeding angry with all this land, and he sware by his throne and kingdom, that he would surely be avenged upon all the coasts of Cilicia and Damascus and Syria, that he would kill with his sword all the inhabitants of the land of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and all Judaea, and all that were in Egypt, until you come to the borders of the two seas. </span>
