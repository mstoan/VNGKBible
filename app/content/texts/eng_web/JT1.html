<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT1_2" data-id="JT1_2">and built at Ecbatana and round about it walls of hewn stones three cubits broad and six cubits long, and made the height of the wall seventy cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT1_3" data-id="JT1_3">and set the towers thereof at the gates thereof, a hundred cubits <span class="add">high, </span> and the breadth thereof in the foundation threescore cubits;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT1_4" data-id="JT1_4">and made the gates thereof, even gates that were raised to the height of seventy cubits, and the breadth of them forty cubits, for the going forth of his mighty hosts, and the setting in array of his footmen:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT1_5" data-id="JT1_5">even in those days king Nebuchadnezzar made war with king Arphaxad in the great plain: this plain is in the borders of Ragau. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT1_6" data-id="JT1_6">And there came to meet him all that lived in the hill country, and all that lived by Euphrates, and Tigris, and Hydaspes, and in the plain of Arioch the king of the Elymaeans; and many nations of the sons of Chelod assembled themselves to the battle. </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT1_7" data-id="JT1_7">And Nebuchadnezzar king of the Assyrians sent to all that lived in Persia, and to all that lived westward, to those that lived in Cilicia and Damascus and Libanus and Antilibanus, and to all that lived over against the sea coast,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT1_8" data-id="JT1_8">and to those among the nations that were of Carmel and Gilead, and to the higher Galilee and the great plain of Esdraelon,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT1_9" data-id="JT1_9">and to all that were in Samaria and the cities thereof, and beyond Jordan to Jerusalem, and Betane, and Chellus, and Kadesh, and the river of Egypt, and Tahpanhes, and Rameses, and all the land of Goshen,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT1_10" data-id="JT1_10">until you come above Tanis and Memphis, and to all that lived in Egypt, until you come to the borders of Ethiopia.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT1_11" data-id="JT1_11">And all they that lived in all the land made light of the commandment of Nebuchadnezzar king of the Assyrians, and went not with him to the war; for they were not afraid of him, but he was before them as one man; and they turned away his messengers from their presence without effect, and with disgrace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT1_12" data-id="JT1_12">And Nebuchadnezzar was exceeding angry with all this land, and he sware by his throne and kingdom, that he would surely be avenged upon all the coasts of Cilicia and Damascus and Syria, that he would kill with his sword all the inhabitants of the land of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and all Judaea, and all that were in Egypt, until you come to the borders of the two seas. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT1_13" data-id="JT1_13">And he set the battle in array with his host against king Arphaxad in the seventeenth year; and he prevailed in his battle, and turned to flight all the host of Arphaxad, and all his horse, and all his chariots;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT1_14" data-id="JT1_14">and he became master of his cities, and he came even to Ecbatana, and took the towers, and spoiled the streets thereof, and turned the beauty thereof into shame. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT1_15" data-id="JT1_15">And he took Arphaxad in the mountains of Ragau, and struck him through with his darts, and destroyed him utterly, to this day. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT1_16" data-id="JT1_16">And he returned with them to Nineveh, he and all his company of sundry nations, an exceeding great multitude of men of war, and there he took his ease and banqueted, he and his host, a hundred and twenty days.</span>
