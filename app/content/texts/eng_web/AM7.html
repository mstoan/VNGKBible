<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_4" data-id="AM7_4">Thus the Lord Yahweh showed me and behold, the Lord Yahweh called for judgment by fire; and it dried up the great deep, and would have devoured the land. </span>

<span class="v AM7_8" data-id="AM7_8">Then the Lord said, “Behold, I will set a plumb line in the middle of my people Israel. I will not again pass by them any more. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_9" data-id="AM7_9">The high places of Isaac will be desolate, the sanctuaries of Israel will be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.” </span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_10" data-id="AM7_10">Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, “Amos has conspired against you in the middle of the house of Israel. The land is not able to bear all his words.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_11" data-id="AM7_11">For Amos says, ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.’”</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_14" data-id="AM7_14">Then Amos answered Amaziah, “I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was a herdsman, and a farmer of sycamore figs; </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_15" data-id="AM7_15">and Yahweh took me from following the flock, and Yahweh said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_16" data-id="AM7_16">Now therefore listen to Yahweh’s word: ‘You say, Don’t prophesy against Israel, and don’t preach against the house of Isaac.’ </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_17" data-id="AM7_17">Therefore Yahweh says: ‘Your wife shall be a prostitute in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be divided by line; and you yourself shall die in a land that is unclean, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.’” </span>
