<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_2" data-id="ZP3_2">She didn’t obey the voice. She didn’t receive correction. She didn’t trust in Yahweh. She didn’t draw near to her God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_3" data-id="ZP3_3">Her princes within her are roaring lions. Her judges are evening wolves. They leave nothing until the next day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_4" data-id="ZP3_4">Her prophets are arrogant and treacherous people. Her priests have profaned the sanctuary. They have done violence to the law. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_5" data-id="ZP3_5">Yahweh, within her, is righteous. He will do no wrong. Every morning he brings his justice to light. He doesn’t fail, but the unjust know no shame. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_6" data-id="ZP3_6">I have cut off nations. Their battlements are desolate. I have made their streets waste, so that no one passes by. Their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_7" data-id="ZP3_7">I said, “Just fear me. Receive correction, so that her dwelling won’t be cut off, according to all that I have appointed concerning her.” But they rose early and corrupted all their doings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_8" data-id="ZP3_8">“Therefore wait for me”, says Yahweh, “until the day that I rise up to the prey, for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour on them my indignation, even all my fierce anger, for all the earth will be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_9" data-id="ZP3_9">For then I will purify the lips of the peoples, that they may all call on Yahweh’s name, to serve him shoulder to shoulder. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_10" data-id="ZP3_10">From beyond the rivers of Cush, my worshipers, even the daughter of my dispersed people, will bring my offering.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_11" data-id="ZP3_11">In that day you will not be disappointed for all your doings, in which you have transgressed against me; for then I will take away out from among you your proudly exulting ones, and you will no more be haughty in my holy mountain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_12" data-id="ZP3_12">But I will leave among you an afflicted and poor people, and they will take refuge in Yahweh’s name.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_15" data-id="ZP3_15">Yahweh has taken away your judgments. He has thrown out your enemy. The King of Israel, Yahweh, is among you. You will not be afraid of evil any more. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_16" data-id="ZP3_16">In that day, it will be said to Jerusalem, “Don’t be afraid, Zion. Don’t let your hands be weak.”</span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP3_18" data-id="ZP3_18">I will remove those who grieve about the appointed feasts from you. They are a burden and a reproach to you.</span>
