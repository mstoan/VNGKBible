<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EG13_2" data-id="EG13_2">After that I became lord over many nations, and had dominion over the whole world, not lifted up with presumption of my authority, but carrying myself always with equity and mildness, I purposed to settle my subjects continually in a quiet life, and making my kingdom peaceful, and open for passage to the utmost coasts, to renew peace, which is desired of all men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EG13_3" data-id="EG13_3">Now when I asked my counselors how this might be brought to pass, Aman, that excelled in wisdom among us, and was approved for his constant good will and stedfast fidelity, and had the honor of the second place in the kingdom,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EG13_4" data-id="EG13_4">declared to us, that in all nations throughout the world there was scattered a certain malignant people, that had laws contrary to all nations, and continually set aside the commandments of kings, so as the uniting of our kingdoms, honorably intended by us, canâ€™t go forward. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EG13_5" data-id="EG13_5">Seeing then we understand that this nation is alone continually in opposition to all men, following perversely a life which is strange to <span class="add">our </span> laws, and evil affected to our state, working all the mischief they can, that our kingdom may not be firmly established: </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EG13_6" data-id="EG13_6">therefore have we commanded, that they that are signified in writing to you by Aman, who is ordained over the affairs, and is a second father to us, shall all, with their wives and children, be utterly destroyed by the sword of their enemies, without all mercy and pity, the fourteenth day of the twelfth month Adar of this present year:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EG13_7" data-id="EG13_7">that they, who of old and now also are malicious, may in one day with violence go down to <span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2"></a></span><span class="note" id="note-3"><a class="key" href="#footnote-3"></a></span><span class="note" id="note-4"><a class="key" href="#footnote-4"></a></span> the grave, and so ever hereafter cause our affairs to be well settled, and without trouble.</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EG13_9" data-id="EG13_9">and said, O Lord, Lord, you King Almighty: for the whole world is in your power, and if it be your will to save Israel, there is no man that can gainsay you: </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EG13_10" data-id="EG13_10">for you have made heaven and earth, and all the wondrous things that are beneath the heaven;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EG13_11" data-id="EG13_11">and you are Lord of all, and there is no man that can resist you, which are the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EG13_12" data-id="EG13_12">You know all things, and you know, Lord, that it was neither in contempt nor pride, nor for any desire of glory, that I did not bow down to proud Aman. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EG13_13" data-id="EG13_13">For I could have been content with good will for the salvation of Israel to kiss the soles of his feet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EG13_14" data-id="EG13_14">But I did this, that I might not prefer the glory of man above the glory of God: neither will I bow down to any but to you, which are my Lord, neither will I do it in pride. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EG13_15" data-id="EG13_15">And now, O Lord, you God <span class="add">and </span> King, the God of Abraham, spare your people: for their eyes are upon us to bring us to nothing, and they desire to destroy the heritage, that has been your from the beginning.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EG13_16" data-id="EG13_16">Despise not your portion, which you did redeem out of the land of Egypt for your own self.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EG13_17" data-id="EG13_17">Hear my prayer, and be merciful to your inheritance: and turn our mourning into feasting, that we may live, O Lord, and sing praises to your name: and destroy not the mouth of them that praise you, O Lord.</span>
