<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S116_7" data-id="S116_7">But Yahweh said to Samuel, “Don’t look on his face, or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for I don’t see as man sees.

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S116_13" data-id="S116_13">Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the middle of his brothers. Then Yahweh’s Spirit came mightily on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S116_14" data-id="S116_14">Now Yahweh’s Spirit departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Yahweh troubled him.</span>

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S116_17" data-id="S116_17">Saul said to his servants, “Provide me now a man who can play well, and bring him to me.”</span>
