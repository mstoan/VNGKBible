<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT14_3" data-id="JT14_3">And these shall take up their panoplies, and shall go into their camp, and rouse up the captains of the host of Asshur, and they shall run together to the tent of Holofernes, and they shall not find him: and fear shall fall upon them, and they shall flee before your face. </span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT14_8" data-id="JT14_8">And now tell me all the things that you have done in these days.

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT14_16" data-id="JT14_16">And he cried with a loud voice, with weeping and groaning and a mighty cry, and tore his garments.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT14_17" data-id="JT14_17">And he entered into the tent where Judith lodged: and he found her not, and he leaped out to the people, and cried aloud,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT14_18" data-id="JT14_18">The slaves have dealt treacherously: one woman of the Hebrews has brought shame upon the house of king Nebuchadnezzar; for, behold, Holofernes <span class="add">lies </span> upon the ground, and his head is not on him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT14_19" data-id="JT14_19">But when the rulers of the host of Asshur heard the words, they tore their coats, and their soul was troubled exceedingly, and there was a cry and an exceeding great noise in the midst of the camp.</span>
