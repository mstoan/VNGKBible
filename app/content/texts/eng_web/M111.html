<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_20" data-id="M111_20">In those days Jonathan gathered together them of Judaea, to take the citadel that was at Jerusalem: and he made many engines of war against it. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_21" data-id="M111_21">And certain that hated their own nation, men that transgressed the law, went to the king, and reported to him that Jonathan was besieging the citadel. </span>

<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_23" data-id="M111_23">But when Jonathan heard this, he commanded to besiege it <span class="add">still: </span> and he chose certain of the elders of Israel and of the priests, and put himself in peril,</span>

<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_26" data-id="M111_26">and the king did to him even as his predecessors had done to him, and exalted him in the sight of all his <span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2"></a></span><span class="note" id="note-3"><a class="key" href="#footnote-3">See</a></span> Friends, </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_27" data-id="M111_27">and confirmed to him the high priesthood, and all the other honors that he had before, and gave him preeminence among his <span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2"></a></span><span class="note" id="note-3"><a class="key" href="#footnote-3">See</a></span> Chief Friends. </span>

<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_29" data-id="M111_29">And the king consented, and wrote letters to Jonathan concerning all these things after this manner:</span>

<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_32" data-id="M111_32">King Demetrius to Lasthenes his father, greeting:</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_33" data-id="M111_33">We have determined to do good to the nation of the Jews, who are our friends, and observe what is just toward us, because of their good will toward us. </span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_34" data-id="M111_34">We have confirmed therefore to them the borders of Judaea, and also the three governments of Aphaerema and Lydda and Ramathaim (<span class="add">these </span> were added to Judaea from the country of Samaria), and all things appertaining to them, for all such as do sacrifice in Jerusalem, instead of the king’s dues which the king received of them yearly aforetime from the produce of the earth and the fruits of trees. </span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_35" data-id="M111_35">And as for the other things that pertain to us from henceforth, of the tenths and the tolls that pertain to us, and the saltpits, and the crowns that pertain to us, all these we will bestow upon them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_36" data-id="M111_36">And not one of these things shall be annulled from this time forth and for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_37" data-id="M111_37">Now therefore be careful to make a copy of these things, and let it be given to Jonathan, and let it be set up on the holy mount in a meet and conspicuous place. </span>

<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_38" data-id="M111_38">And king Demetrius saw that the land was quiet before him, and that no resistance was made to him, and he sent away all his forces, each man to his own place, except the foreign forces, which he had raised from the isles of the Gentiles: and all the forces of his fathers hated him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_39" data-id="M111_39">Now Tryphon was of those who aforetime had been of Alexander’s part, and he saw that all the forces murmured against Demetrius, and he went to Imalcue the Arabian, who was nourishing up Antiochus the young child of Alexander,</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_40" data-id="M111_40">and pressed sore upon him that he should deliver him to him, that he might reign in his father’s stead: and he told him all that Demetrius had done, and the hatred wherewith his forces hated him; and he abode there many days.</span>

<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_49" data-id="M111_49">And they of the city saw that the Jews had made themselves masters of the city as they would, and they waxed faint in their hearts, and they cried out to the king with supplication, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_50" data-id="M111_50">Give us your right hand, and let the Jews cease from fighting against us and the city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_51" data-id="M111_51">And they cast away their arms, and made peace; and the Jews were glorified in the sight of the king, and before all that were in his kingdom; and they returned to Jerusalem, having many spoils.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_52" data-id="M111_52">And king Demetrius sat on the throne of his kingdom, and the land was quiet before him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_53" data-id="M111_53">And he lied in all that he spoke, and estranged himself from Jonathan, and recompensed him not according to the benefits with which he had recompensed him, and afflicted him exceedingly.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_54" data-id="M111_54">Now after this Tryphon returned, and with him the young child Antiochus; and he reigned, and put on a diadem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_55" data-id="M111_55">And there were gathered to him all the forces which Demetrius had sent away with disgrace, and they fought against him, and he fled and was put to the rout. </span>
<span class="v-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_56" data-id="M111_56">And Tryphon took the elephants, and became master of Antioch.</span>
<span class="v-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_57" data-id="M111_57">And the young Antiochus wrote to Jonathan, saying, I confirm to you the high priesthood, and appoint you over the four governments, and to be one of the king’s <span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2"></a></span><span class="note" id="note-3"><a class="key" href="#footnote-3">See</a></span> Friends. </span>
<span class="v-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_58" data-id="M111_58">And he sent to him golden vessels and furniture for the table, and gave him leave to drink in golden vessels, and to be clothed in purple, and to have a golden buckle. </span>
<span class="v-num v-59">59&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_59" data-id="M111_59">And his brother Simon he made captain from the Ladder of Tyre to the borders of Egypt.</span>

<span class="v-num v-61">61&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_61" data-id="M111_61">And he departed thence to Gaza, and they of Gaza shut him out; and he laid siege to it, and burned the suburbs thereof with fire, and spoiled them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-62">62&nbsp;</span><span class="v M111_62" data-id="M111_62">And they of Gaza made request to Jonathan, and he gave them his right hand, and took the sons of their princes for hostages, and sent them away to Jerusalem; and he passed through the country as far as Damascus.</span>
