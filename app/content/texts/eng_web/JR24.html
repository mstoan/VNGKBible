<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR24_2" data-id="JR24_2">One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first-ripe; and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad. </span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR24_7" data-id="JR24_7">I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Yahweh: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God; for they shall return to me with their whole heart. </span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR24_8" data-id="JR24_8">“‘As the bad figs, which can’t be eaten, they are so bad,’ surely Yahweh says, ‘So I will give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the remnant of Jerusalem, who remain in this land, and those who dwell in the land of Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR24_9" data-id="JR24_9">I will even give them up to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places where I shall drive them.</span>
