<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_2" data-id="RM11_2">God didn’t reject his people, which he foreknew. Or don’t you know what the Scripture says about Elijah? How he pleads with God against Israel: </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_3" data-id="RM11_3">“Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken down your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.”<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">1 Kings 19:10,14</span></span> </span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_12" data-id="RM11_12">Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_15" data-id="RM11_15">For if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world, what would their acceptance be, but life from the dead?</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_16" data-id="RM11_16">If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump. If the root is holy, so are the branches.</span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_18" data-id="RM11_18">don’t boast over the branches. But if you boast, it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you.</span>

<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_21" data-id="RM11_21">for if God didn’t spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_22" data-id="RM11_22">See then the goodness and severity of God. Toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_23" data-id="RM11_23">They also, if they don’t continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_24" data-id="RM11_24">For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_25" data-id="RM11_25">For I don’t desire you to be ignorant, brothers,<span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> of this mystery, so that you won’t be wise in your own conceits, that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in,</span>
