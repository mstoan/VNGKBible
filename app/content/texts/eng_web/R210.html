<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R210_8" data-id="R210_8">But he abandoned the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v R210_9" data-id="R210_9">He said to them, “What counsel do you give, that we may give an answer to these people, who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter?’” </span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v R210_10" data-id="R210_10">The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, “Thus you shall tell the people who spoke to you, saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but make it lighter on us;’ thus you shall say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v R210_11" data-id="R210_11">Now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.’” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v R210_12" data-id="R210_12">So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king asked, saying, “Come to me again the third day.” </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v R210_15" data-id="R210_15">So the king didn’t listen to the people; for it was brought about by God, that Yahweh might establish his word, which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v R210_16" data-id="R210_16">When all Israel saw that the king didn’t listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, “What portion have we in David?

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v R210_17" data-id="R210_17">But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v R210_18" data-id="R210_18">Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to forced labor; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones.
