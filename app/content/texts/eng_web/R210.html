<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v R210_15" data-id="R210_15">So the king didn’t listen to the people; for it was brought about by God, that Yahweh might establish his word, which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v R210_16" data-id="R210_16">When all Israel saw that the king didn’t listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, “What portion have we in David?
