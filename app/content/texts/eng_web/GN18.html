<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_2" data-id="GN18_2">He lifted up his eyes and looked, and saw that three men stood opposite him. When he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth, </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_3" data-id="GN18_3">and said, “My lord, if now I have found favor in your sight, please don’t go away from your servant.</span>

<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_19" data-id="GN18_19">For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Yahweh, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Yahweh may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him.”</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_20" data-id="GN18_20">Yahweh said, “Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous,</span>
