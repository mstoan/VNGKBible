<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_19" data-id="GN18_19">For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Yahweh, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Yahweh may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him.”</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_20" data-id="GN18_20">Yahweh said, “Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous,</span>
