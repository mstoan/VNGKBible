<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_3" data-id="R213_3">Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men; and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_4" data-id="R213_4">Abijah stood up on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, “Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_5" data-id="R213_5">Ought you not to know that Yahweh, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt? </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_6" data-id="R213_6">Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_7" data-id="R213_7">Worthless men were gathered to him, base fellows who strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender hearted, and could not withstand them.</span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_8" data-id="R213_8">“Now you intend to withstand the kingdom of Yahweh in the hand of the sons of David. You are a great multitude, and the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods are with you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_9" data-id="R213_9">Haven’t you driven out the priests of Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made priests for yourselves according to the ways of the peoples of other lands? Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may be a priest of those who are no gods. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_10" data-id="R213_10">“But as for us, Yahweh is our God, and we have not forsaken him. We have priests serving Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work; </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_11" data-id="R213_11">and they burn to Yahweh every morning and every evening burnt offerings and sweet incense. They also set the show bread in order on the pure table; and the lamp stand of gold with its lamps, to burn every evening; for we keep the instruction of Yahweh our God, but you have forsaken him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_12" data-id="R213_12">Behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. Children of Israel, don’t fight against Yahweh, the God of your fathers; for you will not prosper.”</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_15" data-id="R213_15">Then the men of Judah gave a shout. As the men of Judah shouted, God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_16" data-id="R213_16">The children of Israel fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hand.</span>
