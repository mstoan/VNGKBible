<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_1" data-id="K111_1">Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites; </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_2" data-id="K111_2">of the nations concerning which Yahweh said to the children of Israel, “You shall not go among them, neither shall they come among you; for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods.” Solomon joined to these in love.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_3" data-id="K111_3">He had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_4" data-id="K111_4">When Solomon was old, his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with Yahweh his God, as the heart of David his father was. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_5" data-id="K111_5">For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_6" data-id="K111_6">Solomon did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and didn’t go fully after Yahweh, as David his father did.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_7" data-id="K111_7">Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, on the mountain that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_8" data-id="K111_8">So he did for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_9" data-id="K111_9">Yahweh was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away from Yahweh, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice, </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_10" data-id="K111_10">and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods; but he didn’t keep that which Yahweh commanded. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_11" data-id="K111_11">Therefore Yahweh said to Solomon, “Because this is done by you, and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you, and will give it to your servant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_12" data-id="K111_12">Nevertheless, I will not do it in your days, for David your father’s sake; but I will tear it out of your son’s hand.</span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_18" data-id="K111_18">They arose out of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him food, and gave him land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_19" data-id="K111_19">Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_20" data-id="K111_20">The sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s house among the sons of Pharaoh. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_21" data-id="K111_21">When Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, “Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_22" data-id="K111_22">Then Pharaoh said to him, “But what have you lacked with me, that behold, you seek to go to your own country?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v K111_22" data-id="K111_22">He answered, “Nothing, however only let me depart.”</span>

<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_23" data-id="K111_23">God raised up an adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_24" data-id="K111_24">He gathered men to himself, and became captain over a troop, when David killed them of Zobah. They went to Damascus, and lived there, and reigned in Damascus. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_25" data-id="K111_25">He was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief of Hadad. He abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_26" data-id="K111_26">Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow, also lifted up his hand against the king. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_27" data-id="K111_27">This was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of his father David’s city. </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_28" data-id="K111_28">The man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he put him in charge of all the labor of the house of Joseph. </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_29" data-id="K111_29">At that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the way; now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_30" data-id="K111_30">Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it in twelve pieces.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_31" data-id="K111_31">He said to Jeroboam, “Take ten pieces; for Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to you </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_32" data-id="K111_32">(but he shall have one tribe, for my servant David’s sake and for Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel); </span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_33" data-id="K111_33">because that they have forsaken me, and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon.

<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_35" data-id="K111_35">but I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give it to you, even ten tribes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_36" data-id="K111_36">To his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there. </span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_37" data-id="K111_37">I will take you, and you shall reign according to all that your soul desires, and shall be king over Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_38" data-id="K111_38">It shall be, if you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do that which is right in my eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with you, and will build you a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_39" data-id="K111_39">I will afflict the offspring<span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> of David for this, but not forever.’”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_40" data-id="K111_40">Therefore Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon. </span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_41" data-id="K111_41">Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, aren’t they written in the book of the acts of Solomon? </span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v K111_42" data-id="K111_42">The time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.</span>
