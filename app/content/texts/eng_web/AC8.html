<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_1" data-id="AC8_1">Saul was consenting to his death. A great persecution arose against the assembly which was in Jerusalem in that day. They were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except for the apostles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_2" data-id="AC8_2">Devout men buried Stephen, and lamented greatly over him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_3" data-id="AC8_3">But Saul ravaged the assembly, entering into every house, and dragged both men and women off to prison.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_4" data-id="AC8_4">Therefore those who were scattered abroad went around preaching the word.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_5" data-id="AC8_5">Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed to them the Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_6" data-id="AC8_6">The multitudes listened with one accord to the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard and saw the signs which he did. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_7" data-id="AC8_7">For unclean spirits came out of many of those who had them. They came out, crying with a loud voice. Many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_8" data-id="AC8_8">There was great joy in that city.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_9" data-id="AC8_9">But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who used to practice sorcery in the city, and amazed the people of Samaria, making himself out to be some great one, </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_10" data-id="AC8_10">to whom they all listened, from the least to the greatest, saying, “This man is that great power of God.”</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_11" data-id="AC8_11">They listened to him, because for a long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_12" data-id="AC8_12">But when they believed Philip preaching good news concerning God’s Kingdom and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_13" data-id="AC8_13">Simon himself also believed. Being baptized, he continued with Philip. Seeing signs and great miracles occurring, he was amazed. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_14" data-id="AC8_14">Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them, </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_15" data-id="AC8_15">who, when they had come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_16" data-id="AC8_16">for as yet he had fallen on none of them. They had only been baptized in the name of Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_17" data-id="AC8_17">Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_18" data-id="AC8_18">Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_19" data-id="AC8_19">saying, “Give me also this power, that whomever I lay my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit.”</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_20" data-id="AC8_20">But Peter said to him, “May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_21" data-id="AC8_21">You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart isn’t right before God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_22" data-id="AC8_22">Repent therefore of this, your wickedness, and ask God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_23" data-id="AC8_23">For I see that you are in the poison of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_24" data-id="AC8_24">Simon answered, “Pray for me to the Lord, that none of the things which you have spoken happen to me.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_25" data-id="AC8_25">They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the Good News to many villages of the Samaritans. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_26" data-id="AC8_26">But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, “Arise, and go toward the south to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desert.” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_27" data-id="AC8_27">He arose and went; and behold, there was a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_28" data-id="AC8_28">He was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_29" data-id="AC8_29">The Spirit said to Philip, “Go near, and join yourself to this chariot.”</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_30" data-id="AC8_30">Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, “Do you understand what you are reading?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_31" data-id="AC8_31">He said, “How can I, unless someone explains it to me?” He begged Philip to come up and sit with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_32" data-id="AC8_32">Now the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this,</span>

<div class="q">
<span class="v AC8_32" data-id="AC8_32">“He was led as a sheep to the slaughter.</span>

<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_34" data-id="AC8_34">The eunuch answered Philip, “Who is the prophet talking about? About himself, or about someone else?”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_35" data-id="AC8_35">Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, preached to him about Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_36" data-id="AC8_36">As they went on the way, they came to some water, and the eunuch said, “Behold, here is water. What is keeping me from being baptized?” </span>
