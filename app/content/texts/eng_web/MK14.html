<span class="v-num v-61">61&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_61" data-id="MK14_61">But he stayed quiet, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?”</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-62">62&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_62" data-id="MK14_62">Jesus said, <span class="wj woj">“I am. You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky.”</span> </span>

<span class="v-num v-65">65&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_65" data-id="MK14_65">Some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him, “Prophesy!” The officers struck him with the palms of their hands. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-66">66&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_66" data-id="MK14_66">As Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the maids of the high priest came,</span>
<span class="v-num v-67">67&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_67" data-id="MK14_67">and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, “You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus!”</span>

<span class="v-num v-68">68&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_68" data-id="MK14_68">But he denied it, saying, “I neither know, nor understand what you are saying.” He went out on the porch, and the rooster crowed. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-69">69&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_69" data-id="MK14_69">The maid saw him, and began again to tell those who stood by, “This is one of them.”</span>
<span class="v-num v-70">70&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_70" data-id="MK14_70">But he again denied it. After a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, “You truly are one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it.” </span>
<span class="v-num v-71">71&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_71" data-id="MK14_71">But he began to curse, and to swear, “I don’t know this man of whom you speak!”</span>
<span class="v-num v-72">72&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK14_72" data-id="MK14_72">The rooster crowed the second time.
