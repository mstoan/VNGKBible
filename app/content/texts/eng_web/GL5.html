<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_1" data-id="GL5_1">Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and don’t be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_2" data-id="GL5_2">Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_3" data-id="GL5_3">Yes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_4" data-id="GL5_4">You are alienated from Christ, you who desire to be justified by the law. You have fallen away from grace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_5" data-id="GL5_5">For we, through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_6" data-id="GL5_6">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision amounts to anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_7" data-id="GL5_7">You were running well! Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_8" data-id="GL5_8">This persuasion is not from him who calls you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_9" data-id="GL5_9">A little yeast grows through the whole lump.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_10" data-id="GL5_10">I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he is. </span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_11" data-id="GL5_11">But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_12" data-id="GL5_12">I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_13" data-id="GL5_13">For you, brothers, were called for freedom. Only don’t use your freedom for gain to the flesh, but through love be servants to one another. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_14" data-id="GL5_14">For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Leviticus 19:18</span></span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_15" data-id="GL5_15">But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you don’t consume one another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_16" data-id="GL5_16">But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won’t fulfill the lust of the flesh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_17" data-id="GL5_17">For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, that you may not do the things that you desire. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_18" data-id="GL5_18">But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_19" data-id="GL5_19">Now the deeds of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_20" data-id="GL5_20">idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_21" data-id="GL5_21">envy, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom. </span>

<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_23" data-id="GL5_23">gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_24" data-id="GL5_24">Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_25" data-id="GL5_25">If we live by the Spirit, let’s also walk by the Spirit.</span>
