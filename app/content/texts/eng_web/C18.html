<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_1" data-id="C18_1">Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_2" data-id="C18_2">But if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he doesn’t yet know as he ought to know.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_3" data-id="C18_3">But if anyone loves God, the same is known by him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_4" data-id="C18_4">Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no other God but one. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_5" data-id="C18_5">For though there are things that are called “gods”, whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are many “gods” and many “lords”; </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_6" data-id="C18_6">yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we live through him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_7" data-id="C18_7">However, that knowledge isn’t in all men. But some, with consciousness of the idol until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_8" data-id="C18_8">But food will not commend us to God. For neither, if we don’t eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_9" data-id="C18_9">But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_10" data-id="C18_10">For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol’s temple, won’t his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols? </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_11" data-id="C18_11">And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_12" data-id="C18_12">Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_13" data-id="C18_13">Therefore if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forever more, that I don’t cause my brother to stumble. </span>
