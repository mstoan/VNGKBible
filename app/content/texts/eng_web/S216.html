<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_9" data-id="S216_9">Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please let me go over and take off his head.” </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_10" data-id="S216_10">The king said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Because he curses, and because Yahweh has said to him, ‘Curse David;’ who then shall say, ‘Why have you done so?’” </span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_16" data-id="S216_16">When Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, had come to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, “Long live the king! Long live the king!” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_17" data-id="S216_17">Absalom said to Hushai, “Is this your kindness to your friend? Why didn’t you go with your friend?”</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_18" data-id="S216_18">Hushai said to Absalom, “No; but whomever Yahweh, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him I will stay. </span>

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_20" data-id="S216_20">Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give your counsel what we shall do.”</span>

<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_21" data-id="S216_21">Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go in to your father’s concubines that he has left to keep the house. Then all Israel will hear that you are abhorred by your father. Then the hands of all who are with you will be strong.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_22" data-id="S216_22">So they spread a tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_23" data-id="S216_23">The counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the inner sanctuary of God. So was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom. </span>
