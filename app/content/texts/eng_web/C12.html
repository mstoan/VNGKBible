<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_2" data-id="C12_2">For I determined not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_3" data-id="C12_3">I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_4" data-id="C12_4">My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_5" data-id="C12_5">that your faith wouldn’t stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_6" data-id="C12_6">We speak wisdom, however, among those who are full grown; yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nothing. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_7" data-id="C12_7">But we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds for our glory, </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_8" data-id="C12_8">which none of the rulers of this world has known. For had they known it, they wouldn’t have crucified the Lord of glory.</span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_10" data-id="C12_10">But to us, God revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_11" data-id="C12_11">For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man, which is in him? Even so, no one knows the things of God, except God’s Spirit. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_12" data-id="C12_12">But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_13" data-id="C12_13">Which things also we speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_14" data-id="C12_14">Now the natural man doesn’t receive the things of God’s Spirit, for they are foolishness to him, and he can’t know them, because they are spiritually discerned. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_15" data-id="C12_15">But he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he himself is judged by no one.</span>
