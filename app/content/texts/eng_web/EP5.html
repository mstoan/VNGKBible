<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_2" data-id="EP5_2">Walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling fragrance. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_3" data-id="EP5_3">But sexual immorality, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be mentioned among you, as becomes saints;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_4" data-id="EP5_4">nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not appropriate; but rather giving of thanks.</span>

<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_5" data-id="EP5_5">Know this for sure, that no sexually immoral person, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_6" data-id="EP5_6">Let no one deceive you with empty words. For because of these things, the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_7" data-id="EP5_7">Therefore don’t be partakers with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_8" data-id="EP5_8">For you were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_9" data-id="EP5_9">for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_10" data-id="EP5_10">proving what is well pleasing to the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_11" data-id="EP5_11">Have no fellowship with the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but rather even reprove them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_12" data-id="EP5_12">For the things which are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_13" data-id="EP5_13">But all things, when they are reproved, are revealed by the light, for everything that reveals is light.</span>

<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_23" data-id="EP5_23">For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the assembly, being himself the savior of the body. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_24" data-id="EP5_24">But as the assembly is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their own husbands in everything.</span>

<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_25" data-id="EP5_25">Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the assembly, and gave himself up for it;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_26" data-id="EP5_26">that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_27" data-id="EP5_27">that he might present the assembly to himself gloriously, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without defect. </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_28" data-id="EP5_28">Even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_29" data-id="EP5_29">For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord also does the assembly;</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_30" data-id="EP5_30">because we are members of his body, of his flesh and bones.</span>
