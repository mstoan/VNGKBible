<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_1" data-id="K11_1">Now king David was old and advanced in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he couldn’t keep warm.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_2" data-id="K11_2">Therefore his servants said to him, “Let a young virgin be sought for my lord the king. Let her stand before the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may keep warm.”</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_3" data-id="K11_3">So they sought for a beautiful young lady throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_4" data-id="K11_4">The young lady was very beautiful; and she cherished the king, and served him; but the king didn’t know her intimately.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_5" data-id="K11_5">Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, “I will be king.” Then he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_6" data-id="K11_6">His father had not displeased him at any time in saying, “Why have you done so?” and he was also a very handsome man; and he was born after Absalom. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_7" data-id="K11_7">He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest; and they followed Adonijah and helped him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_8" data-id="K11_8">But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_9" data-id="K11_9">Adonijah killed sheep, cattle, and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En Rogel; and he called all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah, the king’s servants;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_10" data-id="K11_10">but he didn’t call Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_11" data-id="K11_11">Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, “Haven’t you heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns, and David our lord doesn’t know it? </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_12" data-id="K11_12">Now therefore come, please let me give you counsel, that you may save your own life, and your son Solomon’s life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_13" data-id="K11_13">Go in to king David, and tell him, ‘Didn’t you, my lord, king, swear to your servant, saying, “Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?” Why then does Adonijah reign?’</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_14" data-id="K11_14">Behold,<span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> while you are still talking there with the king, I will also come in after you and confirm your words.”</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_15" data-id="K11_15">Bathsheba went in to the king in his room. The king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was serving the king.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_16" data-id="K11_16">Bathsheba bowed, and showed respect to the king. The king said, “What would you like?”</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_17" data-id="K11_17">She said to him, “My lord, you swore by Yahweh<span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> your God<span class="note" id="note-3"><a class="key" href="#footnote-3">+</a></span> to your servant, ‘Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.’</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_18" data-id="K11_18">Now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and you, my lord the king, don’t know it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_19" data-id="K11_19">He has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the army; but he hasn’t called Solomon your servant.</span>

<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_25" data-id="K11_25">For he has gone down today, and has slain cattle, fatlings, and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king’s sons, the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest. Behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and saying, ‘Long live king Adonijah!’ </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_26" data-id="K11_26">But he hasn’t called me, even me your servant, Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_27" data-id="K11_27">Was this thing done by my lord the king, and you haven’t shown to your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?” </span>

<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_30" data-id="K11_30">most certainly as I swore to you by Yahweh, the God of Israel, saying, ‘Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place;’ I will most certainly do this today.”</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_31" data-id="K11_31">Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and showed respect to the king, and said, “Let my lord king David live forever!” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_32" data-id="K11_32">King David said, “Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.” They came before the king. </span>

<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_34" data-id="K11_34">Let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel. Blow the trumpet, and say, ‘Long live king Solomon!’ </span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_35" data-id="K11_35">Then come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne; for he shall be king in my place. I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.” </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_36" data-id="K11_36">Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, “Amen. May Yahweh, the God of my lord the king, say so.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v K11_37" data-id="K11_37">As Yahweh has been with my lord the king, even so may he be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.” </span>
