</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN3_8" data-id="DN3_8">Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and brought accusation against the Jews.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN3_13" data-id="DN3_13">Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king. </span>

<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN3_24" data-id="DN3_24">Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste: he spoke and said to his counselors, Didn’t we cast three men bound into the middle of the fire? </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v DN3_24" data-id="DN3_24">They answered the king, True, O king.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN3_26" data-id="DN3_26">Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace: he spoke and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the Most High God, come out, and come here.</span>

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN3_28" data-id="DN3_28">Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel, and delivered his servants who trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN3_29" data-id="DN3_29">Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak anything evil against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill; because there is no other god who is able to deliver after this sort. </span>
