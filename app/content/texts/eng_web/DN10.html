</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN10_2" data-id="DN10_2">In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three whole weeks.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN10_3" data-id="DN10_3">I ate no pleasant bread, neither came meat nor wine into my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, until three whole weeks were fulfilled. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN10_4" data-id="DN10_4">In the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN10_5" data-id="DN10_5">I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold, a man clothed in linen, whose thighs were adorned with pure gold of Uphaz:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN10_6" data-id="DN10_6">his body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as flaming torches, and his arms and his feet like burnished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN10_7" data-id="DN10_7">I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; for the men who were with me didn’t see the vision; but a great quaking fell on them, and they fled to hide themselves. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN10_8" data-id="DN10_8">So I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me; for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN10_9" data-id="DN10_9">Yet heard I the voice of his words; and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I fallen into a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground. </span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN10_10" data-id="DN10_10">Behold, a hand touched me, which set me on my knees and on the palms of my hands.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN10_12" data-id="DN10_12">Then he said to me, Don’t be afraid, Daniel; for from the first day that you set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard: and I have come for your words’ sake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN10_13" data-id="DN10_13">But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days; but, behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me: and I remained there with the kings of Persia. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN10_14" data-id="DN10_14">Now I have come to make you understand what shall happen to your people in the latter days; for the vision is yet for many days: </span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN10_16" data-id="DN10_16">Behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spoke and said to him who stood before me, my lord, by reason of the vision my sorrows are turned on me, and I retain no strength.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN10_17" data-id="DN10_17">For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, immediately there remained no strength in me, neither was there breath left in me. </span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN10_18" data-id="DN10_18">Then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN10_19" data-id="DN10_19">He said, “Greatly beloved man, don’t be afraid: peace be to you, be strong, yes, be strong.”</span>
