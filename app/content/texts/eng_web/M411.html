<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_1" data-id="M411_1">And when he had died, disfigured in his torments, the fifth leaped forward, and said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_2" data-id="M411_2">I intend not, O tyrant, to get excused from the torment which is in behalf of virtue.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_3" data-id="M411_3">But I have come of mine own accord, that by the death of me, you may owe heavenly vengeance a punishment for more crimes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_4" data-id="M411_4">O you hater of virtue and of men, what have we done that you thus revel in our blood?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_5" data-id="M411_5">Does it seem evil to you that we worship the Founder of all things, and live according to his surpassing law?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_6" data-id="M411_6">But this is worthy of honors, not torments;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_7" data-id="M411_7">had you been capable of the higher feelings of men, and possessed the hope of salvation from God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_8" data-id="M411_8">Behold now, being alien from God, you make war against those who are religious toward God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_9" data-id="M411_9">As he said this, the spearbearers bound him, and drew him to the catapelt:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_10" data-id="M411_10">to which binding him at his knees, and fastening them with iron fetters, they bent down his loins upon the wedge of the wheel; and his body was then dismembered, scorpion-fashion. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_11" data-id="M411_11">With his breath thus confined, and his body strangled, he said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_12" data-id="M411_12">A great favor you bestow upon us, O tyrant, by enabling us to manifest our adherence to the law by means of nobler sufferings. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_13" data-id="M411_13">He also being dead, the sixth, quite a youth, was brought out; and on the tyrant asking him whether he would eat and be delivered, he said, </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_14" data-id="M411_14">I am indeed younger than my brothers, but in understanding I am as old;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_15" data-id="M411_15">for having been born and reared to the same end, we are bound to die also in behalf of the same cause.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_16" data-id="M411_16">So that if youâŒƒ think proper to torment us for not eating the unclean, then torment!</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_17" data-id="M411_17">As he said this, they brought him to the wheel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_18" data-id="M411_18">Extended upon which, with limbs racked and dislocated, he was gradually roasted from beneath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_19" data-id="M411_19">And having heated sharp spits, they approached them to his back; and having transfixed his sides, they burned away his entrails. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_20" data-id="M411_20">And he, while tormented, said, O period good and holy, in which, for the sake of religion, we brethren have been called to the contest of pain, and have not been conquered. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_21" data-id="M411_21">For religious understanding, O tyrant, is unconquered.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_22" data-id="M411_22">Armed with upright virtue, I also shall depart with my brethren.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_23" data-id="M411_23">I, too, bearing with me a great avenger, O deviser of tortures, and enemy of the truly pious.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_24" data-id="M411_24">We six youths have destroyed your tyranny.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_25" data-id="M411_25">For is not your inability to overrule our reasoning, and to compel us to eat the unclean, your destruction?</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_26" data-id="M411_26">Your fire is cold to us, your catapelts are painless, and your violence harmless.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v M411_27" data-id="M411_27">For the guards not of a tyrant but of a divine law are our defenders: through this we keep our reasoning unconquered.</span>
