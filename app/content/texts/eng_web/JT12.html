<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT12_12" data-id="JT12_12">For, behold, it is a shame for our person, if we shall let such a woman go, not having had her company; for if we draw her not to us, she shall laugh us to scorn. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT12_13" data-id="JT12_13">And Bagoas went from the presence of Holofernes, and came in to her, and said, Let not this fair damsel fear to come to my lord, and to be honored in his presence, and to drink wine and be merry with us, and to be made this day as one of the daughters of the children of Asshur, which wait in the house of Nebuchadnezzar.</span>
