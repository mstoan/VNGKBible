<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_1" data-id="SN1_1">THERE lived a man in Babylon, and his name was Joakim:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_2" data-id="SN1_2">and he took a wife, whose name was Susanna, the daughter of Helkias, a very fair woman, and one that feared the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_3" data-id="SN1_3">Her parents also were righteous, and taught their daughter according to the law of Moses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_4" data-id="SN1_4">Now Joakim was a great rich man, and had a fair garden joining to his house: and to him resorted the Jews; because he was more honorable than all others. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_5" data-id="SN1_5">And the same year there were appointed two of the ancients of the people to be judges, such as the Lord spoke of, that wickedness came from Babylon from ancient judges, who were accounted to govern the people.
</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_6" data-id="SN1_6">These kept much at Joakim’s house: and all that had any suits in law came to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_7" data-id="SN1_7">Now when the people departed away at noon, Susanna went into her husband’s garden to walk.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_8" data-id="SN1_8">And the two elders saw her going in every day, and walking; and they were inflamed with love for her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_9" data-id="SN1_9">And they perverted their own mind, and turned away their eyes, that they might not look to heaven, nor remember just judgements. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_10" data-id="SN1_10">And albeit they both were wounded with her love, yet dared not one show another his grief.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_11" data-id="SN1_11">For they were ashamed to declare their lust, that they desired to have to do with her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_12" data-id="SN1_12">Yet they watched jealously from day to day to see her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_13" data-id="SN1_13">And the one said to the other, Let us now go home: for it is dinner time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_14" data-id="SN1_14">So when they were gone out, they parted the one from the other, and turning back again they came to the same place; and after that they had asked one another the cause, they acknowledged their lust: and then appointed they a time both together,
 when they might find her alone. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_15" data-id="SN1_15">And it fell out, as they watched a fit day, she went in as aforetime with two maids only, and she was desirous to wash herself in the garden: for it was hot. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_16" data-id="SN1_16">And there was nobody there save the two elders, that had hid themselves, and watched her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_17" data-id="SN1_17">Then she said to her maids, Bring me oil and washing balls, and shut the garden doors, that I may wash me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_18" data-id="SN1_18">And they did as she bade them, and shut the garden doors, and went out themselves at the side doors to fetch the things that she had commanded them: and they saw not the elders, because they were hid.
</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_19" data-id="SN1_19">Now when the maids were gone forth, the two elders rose up, and ran to her, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_20" data-id="SN1_20">Behold, the garden doors are shut, that no man can see us, and we are in love with you; therefore consent to us, and lie with us. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_21" data-id="SN1_21">If you will not, we will bear witness against you, that a young man was with you: and therefore you did send away your maids from you. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_22" data-id="SN1_22">Then Susanna sighed, and said, I am straitened on every side: for if I do this thing, it is death to me: and if I do it not, I can’t escape your hands. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_23" data-id="SN1_23">It is better for me to fall into your hands, and not do it, than to sin in the sight of the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_24" data-id="SN1_24">With that Susanna cried with a loud voice: and the two elders cried out against her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_25" data-id="SN1_25">Then ran the one, and opened the garden doors.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_26" data-id="SN1_26">So when the servants of the house heard the cry in the garden, they rushed in at the side door, to see what had befallen her. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_27" data-id="SN1_27">But when the elders had told their tale, the servants were greatly ashamed: for there was never such a report made of Susanna. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_28" data-id="SN1_28">And it came to pass on the morrow, when the people assembled to her husband Joakim, the two elders came full of their wicked intent against Susanna to put her to death; 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_29" data-id="SN1_29">and said before the people, Send for Susanna, the daughter of Helkias, Joakim’s wife. So they sent;</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_30" data-id="SN1_30">and she came with her father and mother, her children, and all her kindred.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_31" data-id="SN1_31">Now Susanna was a very delicate woman, and beauteous to behold.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_32" data-id="SN1_32">And these wicked men commanded her to be unveiled, (for she was veiled) that they might be filled with her beauty.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_33" data-id="SN1_33">Therefore her friends and all that saw her wept.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_34" data-id="SN1_34">Then the two elders stood up in the midst of the people, and laid their hands upon her head.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_35" data-id="SN1_35">And she weeping looked up toward heaven: for her heart trusted in the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_36" data-id="SN1_36">And the elders said, As we walked in the garden alone, this <span class="add">woman </span> came in with two maids, and shut the garden doors, and sent the maids away.
</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_37" data-id="SN1_37">Then a young man, who there was hid, came to her, and lay with her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_38" data-id="SN1_38">And we, being in a corner of the garden, saw this wickedness, and ran to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_39" data-id="SN1_39">And when we saw them together, the man we could not hold: for he was stronger than we, and opened the doors, and leaped out. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_40" data-id="SN1_40">But having taken this <span class="add">woman</span>, we asked who the young man was, but she would not tell us: these things do we testify. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_41" data-id="SN1_41">Then the assembly believed them, as those that were elders of the people and judges: so they condemned her to death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_42" data-id="SN1_42">Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice, and said, O everlasting God, that know the secrets, that know all things before they be: 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_43" data-id="SN1_43">you know that they have borne false witness against me, and, behold, I must die; whereas I never did such things as these men have maliciously invented against me. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_44" data-id="SN1_44">And the Lord heard her voice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_45" data-id="SN1_45">Therefore when she was led away to be put to death, God raised up the holy spirit of a young youth, whose name was Daniel: 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_46" data-id="SN1_46">and he cried with a loud voice, I am clear from the blood of this woman.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_47" data-id="SN1_47">Then all the people turned them toward him, and said, What mean these words that you have spoken?</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_48" data-id="SN1_48">So he standing in the midst of them said, Are you⌃ such fools, you⌃ sons of Israel, that without examination or knowledge of the truth you⌃ have condemned a daughter of Israel? 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_49" data-id="SN1_49">Return again to the place of judgement: for these have borne false witness against her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_50" data-id="SN1_50">Wherefore all the people turned again in haste, and the elders said to him, Come, sit down among us, and show it us, seeing God has given you the honor of an elder. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_51" data-id="SN1_51">Then said Daniel to them, Put them asunder one far from another, and I will examine them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_52" data-id="SN1_52">So when they were put asunder one from another, he called one of them, and said to him, O you that have become old in wickedness, now are your sins come <span class="add">home to you </span> which you have committed aforetime,
</span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_53" data-id="SN1_53">in pronouncing unjust judgement, and condemning the innocent, and letting the guilty go free; albeit the Lord says, The innocent and righteous shall you not kill. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_54" data-id="SN1_54">Now then, if you saw her, tell me, Under what tree saw you them companying together? Who answered, Under a mastick tree.</span>
<span class="v-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_55" data-id="SN1_55">And Daniel said, Right well have you lied against your own head; for even now the angel of God has received the sentence of God and shall cut you in two. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_56" data-id="SN1_56">So he put him aside, and commanded to bring the other, and said to him, O you seed of Canaan, and not of Judah, beauty has deceived you, and lust has perverted your heart. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_57" data-id="SN1_57">Thus have you⌃ dealt with the daughters of Israel, and they for fear companied with you: but the daughter of Judah would not abide your wickedness. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_58" data-id="SN1_58">Now therefore tell me, Under what tree did you take them companying together? Who answered, Under a holm tree.</span>
<span class="v-num v-59">59&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_59" data-id="SN1_59">Then said Daniel to him, Right well have you also lied against your own head: for the angel of God waits with the sword to cut you in two, that he may destroy you. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-60">60&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_60" data-id="SN1_60">With that all the assembly cried out with a loud voice, and blessed God, who saves them that hope in him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-61">61&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_61" data-id="SN1_61">And they arose against the two elders, for Daniel had convicted them of false witness out of their own mouth:</span>
<span class="v-num v-62">62&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_62" data-id="SN1_62">and according to the law of Moses they did to them in such sort as they maliciously intended to do to their neighbor: and they put them to death, and the innocent blood was saved the same day.
</span>
<span class="v-num v-63">63&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_63" data-id="SN1_63">Therefore Helkias and his wife praised God for their daughter Susanna, with Joakim her husband, and all the kindred, because there was no dishonesty found in her. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-64">64&nbsp;</span><span class="v SN1_64" data-id="SN1_64">And from that day forth was Daniel had in great reputation in the sight of the people. </span>
