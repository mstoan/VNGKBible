<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS24_2" data-id="IS24_2">It will be as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the creditor, so with the debtor; as with the taker of interest, so with the giver of interest. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS24_3" data-id="IS24_3">The earth will be utterly emptied and utterly laid waste; for Yahweh has spoken this word.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS24_4" data-id="IS24_4">The earth mourns and fades away. The world languishes and fades away. The lofty people of the earth languish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS24_5" data-id="IS24_5">The earth also is polluted under its inhabitants, because they have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS24_6" data-id="IS24_6">Therefore the curse has devoured the earth, and those who dwell therein are found guilty. Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS24_7" data-id="IS24_7">The new wine mourns. The vine languishes. All the merry-hearted sigh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS24_8" data-id="IS24_8">The mirth of tambourines ceases. The sound of those who rejoice ends. The joy of the harp ceases.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS24_9" data-id="IS24_9">They will not drink wine with a song. Strong drink will be bitter to those who drink it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS24_10" data-id="IS24_10">The confused city is broken down. Every house is shut up, that no man may come in.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS24_11" data-id="IS24_11">There is a crying in the streets because of the wine. All joy is darkened. The mirth of the land is gone.</span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS24_13" data-id="IS24_13">For it will be so within the earth among the peoples, as the shaking of an olive tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is done. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS24_14" data-id="IS24_14">These shall lift up their voice. They will shout for the majesty of Yahweh. They cry aloud from the sea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS24_15" data-id="IS24_15">Therefore glorify Yahweh in the east, even the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, in the islands of the sea!</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS24_16" data-id="IS24_16">From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs. Glory to the righteous! But I said, “I pine away!

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS24_17" data-id="IS24_17">Fear, the pit, and the snare, are on you who inhabitant the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS24_18" data-id="IS24_18">It will happen that he who flees from the noise of the fear will fall into the pit; and he who comes up out of the middle of the pit will be taken in the snare; for the windows on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS24_19" data-id="IS24_19">The earth is utterly broken. The earth is torn apart. The earth is shaken violently.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS24_20" data-id="IS24_20">The earth will stagger like a drunken man, and will sway back and forth like a hammock. Its disobedience will be heavy on it, and it will fall and not rise again. </span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS24_22" data-id="IS24_22">They shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison; and after many days shall they be visited. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS24_23" data-id="IS24_23">Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for Yahweh of Armies will reign on Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem; and before his elders will be glory. </span>
