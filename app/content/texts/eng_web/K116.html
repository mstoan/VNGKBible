<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v K116_25" data-id="K116_25">Omri did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and dealt wickedly above all who were before him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v K116_26" data-id="K116_26">For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins with which he made Israel to sin, to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v K116_27" data-id="K116_27">Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v K116_28" data-id="K116_28">So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son reigned in his place.</span>

<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v K116_31" data-id="K116_31">As if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshiped him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v K116_32" data-id="K116_32">He raised up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v K116_33" data-id="K116_33">Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did more yet to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v K116_34" data-id="K116_34">In his days Hiel the Bethelite built Jericho.
