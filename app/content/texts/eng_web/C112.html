<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_1" data-id="C112_1">Now concerning spiritual things, brothers, I don’t want you to be ignorant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_2" data-id="C112_2">You know that when you were heathen,<span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> you were led away to those mute idols, however you might be led.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_3" data-id="C112_3">Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God’s Spirit says, “Jesus is accursed.” No one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” but by the Holy Spirit. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_4" data-id="C112_4">Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_5" data-id="C112_5">There are various kinds of service, and the same Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_6" data-id="C112_6">There are various kinds of workings, but the same God, who works all things in all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_7" data-id="C112_7">But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_8" data-id="C112_8">For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit; </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_9" data-id="C112_9">to another faith, by the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, by the same Spirit;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_10" data-id="C112_10">and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; to another different kinds of languages; and to another the interpretation of languages.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_11" data-id="C112_11">But the one and the same Spirit produces all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_12" data-id="C112_12">For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_13" data-id="C112_13">For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all given to drink into one Spirit. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_14" data-id="C112_14">For the body is not one member, but many.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_15" data-id="C112_15">If the foot would say, “Because I’m not the hand, I’m not part of the body,” it is not therefore not part of the body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_16" data-id="C112_16">If the ear would say, “Because I’m not the eye, I’m not part of the body,” it’s not therefore not part of the body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_17" data-id="C112_17">If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_18" data-id="C112_18">But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_19" data-id="C112_19">If they were all one member, where would the body be?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_20" data-id="C112_20">But now they are many members, but one body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_21" data-id="C112_21">The eye can’t tell the hand, “I have no need for you,” or again the head to the feet, “I have no need for you.”</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_22" data-id="C112_22">No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_23" data-id="C112_23">Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety; </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_24" data-id="C112_24">whereas our presentable parts have no such need. But God composed the body together, giving more abundant honor to the inferior part, </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_25" data-id="C112_25">that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_26" data-id="C112_26">When one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. Or when one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_27" data-id="C112_27">Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_28" data-id="C112_28">God has set some in the assembly: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various kinds of languages. </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_29" data-id="C112_29">Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all miracle workers?</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_30" data-id="C112_30">Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with various languages? Do all interpret?</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_31" data-id="C112_31">But earnestly desire the best gifts. Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you.</span>
