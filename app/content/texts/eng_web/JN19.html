<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_19" data-id="JN19_19">Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. There was written, “JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.”</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_20" data-id="JN19_20">Therefore many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_21" data-id="JN19_21">The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, “Don’t write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but, ‘he said, “I am King of the Jews.”’” </span>

<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_26" data-id="JN19_26">Therefore when Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, <span class="wj woj">“Woman, behold, your son!” </span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_27" data-id="JN19_27">Then he said to the disciple, <span class="wj woj">“Behold, your mother!”</span> From that hour, the disciple took her to his own home.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_28" data-id="JN19_28">After this, Jesus, seeing<span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> that all things were now finished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, <span class="wj woj">“I am thirsty.”</span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_29" data-id="JN19_29">Now a vessel full of vinegar was set there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his mouth.</span>

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_31" data-id="JN19_31">Therefore the Jews, because it was the Preparation Day, so that the bodies wouldn’t remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a special one), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_32" data-id="JN19_32">Therefore the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_33" data-id="JN19_33">but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they didn’t break his legs.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_34" data-id="JN19_34">However one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_35" data-id="JN19_35">He who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, that you may believe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_36" data-id="JN19_36">For these things happened, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, “A bone of him will not be broken.”<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Exodus 12:46; Numbers 9:12; Psalm 34:20</span></span> </span>

<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_38" data-id="JN19_38">After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away Jesus’ body. Pilate gave him permission. He came therefore and took away his body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_39" data-id="JN19_39">Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred Roman pounds.<span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_40" data-id="JN19_40">So they took Jesus’ body, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_41" data-id="JN19_41">Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden. In the garden was a new tomb in which no man had ever yet been laid. </span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_42" data-id="JN19_42">Then because of the Jews’ Preparation Day (for the tomb was near at hand) they laid Jesus there.</span>
