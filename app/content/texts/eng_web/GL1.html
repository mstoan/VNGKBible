<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_1" data-id="GL1_1">Paul, an apostle (not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead), </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_2" data-id="GL1_2">and all the brothers<span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> who are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_3" data-id="GL1_3">Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_4" data-id="GL1_4">who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father— </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_5" data-id="GL1_5">to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</span>

<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_6" data-id="GL1_6">I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different “good news”;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_7" data-id="GL1_7">and there isn’t another “good news.” Only there are some who trouble you, and want to pervert the Good News of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_8" data-id="GL1_8">But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any “good news” other than that which we preached to you, let him be cursed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_9" data-id="GL1_9">As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to you any “good news” other than that which you received, let him be cursed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_10" data-id="GL1_10">For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn’t be a servant of Christ. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_11" data-id="GL1_11">But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which was preached by me, that it is not according to man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_12" data-id="GL1_12">For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_13" data-id="GL1_13">For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God, and ravaged it. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_14" data-id="GL1_14">I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_15" data-id="GL1_15">But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me through his grace,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_16" data-id="GL1_16">to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn’t immediately confer with flesh and blood,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_17" data-id="GL1_17">nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to Damascus. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_18" data-id="GL1_18">Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_19" data-id="GL1_19">But of the other apostles I saw no one, except James, the Lord’s brother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_20" data-id="GL1_20">Now about the things which I write to you, behold,<span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span> before God, I’m not lying.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_21" data-id="GL1_21">Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_22" data-id="GL1_22">I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_23" data-id="GL1_23">but they only heard: “He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy.”</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_24" data-id="GL1_24">And they glorified God in me.</span>
