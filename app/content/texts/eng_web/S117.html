<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_42" data-id="S117_42">When the Philistine looked around, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and had a good looking face. </span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_43" data-id="S117_43">The Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?” The Philistine cursed David by his gods.</span>

<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_50" data-id="S117_50">So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine, and killed him; but there was no sword in the hand of David. </span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_51" data-id="S117_51">Then David ran, stood over the Philistine, took his sword, drew it out of its sheath, killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_52" data-id="S117_52">The men of Israel and of Judah arose and shouted, and pursued the Philistines as far as Gai and to the gates of Ekron.
