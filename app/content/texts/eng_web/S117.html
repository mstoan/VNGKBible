</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_27" data-id="S117_27">The people answered him in this way, saying, “So shall it be done to the man who kills him.”</span>

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_29" data-id="S117_29">David said, “What have I now done? Is there not a cause?”</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_30" data-id="S117_30">He turned away from him toward another, and spoke like that again; and the people answered him again the same way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_31" data-id="S117_31">When the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_32" data-id="S117_32">David said to Saul, “Let no man’s heart fail because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.”</span>

<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_35" data-id="S117_35">I went out after him, and struck him, and rescued it out of his mouth. When he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and struck him, and killed him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_36" data-id="S117_36">Your servant struck both the lion and the bear. This uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, since he has defied the armies of the living God.” </span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_37" data-id="S117_37">David said, “Yahweh who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.” </span>

<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_38" data-id="S117_38">Saul dressed David with his clothing. He put a helmet of brass on his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_39" data-id="S117_39">David strapped his sword on his clothing, and he tried to move; for he had not tested it. David said to Saul, “I can’t go with these; for I have not tested them.” Then David took them off.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_40" data-id="S117_40">He took his staff in his hand, and chose for himself five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the pouch of his shepherd’s bag which he had.

<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_41" data-id="S117_41">The Philistine walked and came near to David; and the man who bore the shield went before him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_42" data-id="S117_42">When the Philistine looked around, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and had a good looking face. </span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_43" data-id="S117_43">The Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?” The Philistine cursed David by his gods.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_44" data-id="S117_44">The Philistine said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky, and to the animals of the field.” </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_45" data-id="S117_45">Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin; but I come to you in the name of Yahweh of Armies, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_46" data-id="S117_46">Today, Yahweh will deliver you into my hand. I will strike you, and take your head from off you. I will give the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines today to the birds of the sky, and to the wild animals of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, </span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_47" data-id="S117_47">and that all this assembly may know that Yahweh doesn’t save with sword and spear; for the battle is Yahweh’s, and he will give you into our hand.” </span>

<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_48" data-id="S117_48">When the Philistine arose, and walked and came near to meet David, David hurried, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. </span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_49" data-id="S117_49">David put his hand in his bag, took a stone, and slung it, and struck the Philistine in his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_50" data-id="S117_50">So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine, and killed him; but there was no sword in the hand of David. </span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_51" data-id="S117_51">Then David ran, stood over the Philistine, took his sword, drew it out of its sheath, killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_52" data-id="S117_52">The men of Israel and of Judah arose and shouted, and pursued the Philistines as far as Gai and to the gates of Ekron. The wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath and to Ekron.</span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v S117_53" data-id="S117_53">The children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines and they plundered their camp.</span>
