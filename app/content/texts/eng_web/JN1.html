<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN1_7" data-id="JN1_7">The same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all might believe through him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN1_8" data-id="JN1_8">He was not the light, but was sent that he might testify about the light.</span>
