<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR16_5" data-id="JR16_5">For Yahweh says, “Don’t enter into the house of mourning, neither go to lament, neither bemoan them; for I have taken away my peace from this people,” says Yahweh, “even loving kindness and tender mercies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR16_6" data-id="JR16_6">Both great and small shall die in this land; they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them; </span>
