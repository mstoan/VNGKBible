<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_1" data-id="JT8_1">And in those days Judith heard thereof, the daughter of Merari, the son of Ox, the son of Joseph, the son of Oziel, the son of Elkiah, the son of Ananias, the son of Gideon, the son of Raphaim, the son of Ahitub, the son of Elihu, the son of Eliab, the son of Nathanael, the son of Salamiel, the son of Salasadai, the son of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_2" data-id="JT8_2">And her husband was Manasses, of her tribe and of her family, and he died in the days of barley harvest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_3" data-id="JT8_3">For he stood over them that bound sheaves in the field, and the heat came upon his head, and he fell on his bed, and died in his city Bethulia: and they buried him with his fathers in the field which is between Dothaim and Balamon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_4" data-id="JT8_4">And Judith was a widow in her house three years and four months.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_5" data-id="JT8_5">And she made her a tent upon the roof of her house, and put on sackcloth upon her loins; and the garments of her widowhood were upon her. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_6" data-id="JT8_6">And she fasted all the days of her widowhood, save the eves of the Sabbaths, and the Sabbaths, and the eves of the new moons, and the new moons, and the feasts and joyful days of the house of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_7" data-id="JT8_7">And she was of a goodly countenance, and exceeding beautiful to behold: and her husband Manasses had left her gold, and silver, and menservants, and maidservants, and cattle, and lands; and she remained upon them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_8" data-id="JT8_8">And there was none that gave her an evil word; for she feared God exceedingly.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_9" data-id="JT8_9">And she heard the evil words of the people against the governor, because they fainted for lack of water; and Judith heard all the words that Ozias spoke to them, how he sware to them that he would deliver the city to the Assyrians after five days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_10" data-id="JT8_10">And she sent her maid, that was over all things that she had, to call Ozias and Chabris and Charmis, the elders of her city. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_11" data-id="JT8_11">And they came to her, and she said to them,</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v JT8_11" data-id="JT8_11">Hear me now, O you⌃ rulers of the inhabitants of Bethulia: for your word that you⌃ have spoken before the people this day is not right, and you⌃ have set the oath which you⌃ have pronounced between God and you, and have promised to deliver the city to our enemies, unless within these days the Lord turn to help you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_12" data-id="JT8_12">And now who are you⌃ that have tempted God this day, and stand instead of God among the children of men?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_13" data-id="JT8_13">And now try the Lord Almighty, and you⌃ shall never know anything.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_14" data-id="JT8_14">For you⌃ shall not find the depth of the heart of man, and you⌃ shall not perceive the things that he thinks: and how shall you⌃ search out God, which has made all these things, and know his mind, and comprehend his purpose? Nay, my brethren, provoke not the Lord our God to anger. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_15" data-id="JT8_15">For if he be not minded to help us within these five days, he has power to defend us in such time as he will, or to destroy us before the face of our enemies. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_16" data-id="JT8_16">But do not you⌃ pledge the counsels of the Lord our God: for God is not as man, that he should be threatened; neither as the son of man, that he should be turned by entreaty. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_17" data-id="JT8_17">Wherefore let us wait for the salvation that comes from him, and call upon him to help us, and he will hear our voice, if it please him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_18" data-id="JT8_18">For there arose none in our age, neither is there any of us today, tribe, or kindred, or family, or city, which worship gods made with hands, as it was in the former days; </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_19" data-id="JT8_19">for the which cause our fathers were given to the sword, and for a spoil, and fell with a great fall before our enemies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_20" data-id="JT8_20">But we know none other god beside him, wherefore we hope that he will not despise us, nor any of our race.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_21" data-id="JT8_21">For if we be taken so, all Judaea shall sit upon the ground, and our sanctuary shall be spoiled; and of our blood shall he require the profanation thereof. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_22" data-id="JT8_22">And the slaughter of our brethren, and the captivity of the land, and the desolation of our inheritance, shall he turn upon our heads among the Gentiles, wherever we shall be in bondage; and we shall be an offence and a reproach before them that take us for a possession. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_23" data-id="JT8_23">For our bondage shall not be ordered to favor: but the Lord our God shall turn it to dishonor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_24" data-id="JT8_24">And now, brethren, let us show an example to our brethren, because their soul hangs upon us, and the sanctuary and the house and the altar rest upon us. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_25" data-id="JT8_25">Besides all this let us give thanks to the Lord our God, which tries us, even as he did our fathers also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_26" data-id="JT8_26">Remember all the things which he did to Abraham, and all the things in which he tried Isaac, and all the things which happened to Jacob in Mesopotamia of Syria, when he kept the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_27" data-id="JT8_27">For he has not tried us in the fire, as he did them, to search out their hearts, neither has he taken vengeance on us; but the Lord does scourge them that come near to him, to admonish them.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_28" data-id="JT8_28">And Ozias said to her, All that you have spoken have you spoken with a good heart, and there is none that shall gainsay your words. </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_29" data-id="JT8_29">For this is not the first day wherein your wisdom is manifested; but from the beginning of your days all the people have known your understanding, because the disposition of your heart is good.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_30" data-id="JT8_30">But the people were exceeding thirsty, and compelled us to do as we spoke to them, and to bring an oath upon ourselves, which we will not break. </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_31" data-id="JT8_31">And now pray you for us, because you are a godly woman, and the Lord shall send us rain to fill our cisterns, and we shall faint no more. </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_32" data-id="JT8_32">And Judith said to them, Hear me, and I will do a thing, which shall go down to all generations among the children of our race. </span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_33" data-id="JT8_33">You⌃ shall stand at the gate this night, and I will go forth with my maid: and, within the days after which you⌃ said that you⌃ would deliver the city to our enemies, the Lord shall visit Israel by my hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_34" data-id="JT8_34">But you⌃ shall not inquire of mine act: for I will not declare it to you, till the things be finished that I do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_35" data-id="JT8_35">And Ozias and the rulers said to her, Go in peace, and the Lord God be before you, to take vengeance on our enemies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JT8_36" data-id="JT8_36">And they returned from the tent, and went to their stations.</span>
