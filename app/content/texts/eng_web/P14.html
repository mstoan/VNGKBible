<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v P14_3" data-id="P14_3">For we have spent enough of our past time doing the desire of the Gentiles, and having walked in lewdness, lusts, drunken binges, orgies, carousings, and abominable idolatries. </span>

<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v P14_6" data-id="P14_6">For to this end the Good News was preached even to the dead, that they might be judged indeed as men in the flesh, but live as to God in the spirit. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v P14_7" data-id="P14_7">But the end of all things is near. Therefore be of sound mind, self-controlled, and sober in prayer.</span>
