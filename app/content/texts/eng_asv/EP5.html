<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_1" data-id="EP5_1">Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_2" data-id="EP5_2">and walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odor of a sweet smell. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_3" data-id="EP5_3">But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_4" data-id="EP5_4">nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not befitting: but rather giving of thanks.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_5" data-id="EP5_5">For this ye know of a surety, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_6" data-id="EP5_6">Let no man deceive you with empty words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_7" data-id="EP5_7">Be not ye therefore partakers with them;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_8" data-id="EP5_8">For ye were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord: walk as children of light</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_9" data-id="EP5_9">(for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth),</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_10" data-id="EP5_10">proving what is well-pleasing unto the Lord;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_11" data-id="EP5_11">and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_12" data-id="EP5_12">for the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_13" data-id="EP5_13">But all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light: for everything that is made manifest is light.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_14" data-id="EP5_14">Wherefore <span class="add">he</span> saith, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_15" data-id="EP5_15">Look therefore carefully how ye walk, not as unwise, but as wise;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_16" data-id="EP5_16">redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_17" data-id="EP5_17">Wherefore be ye not foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_18" data-id="EP5_18">And be not drunken with wine, wherein is riot, but be filled with the Spirit;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_19" data-id="EP5_19">speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_20" data-id="EP5_20">giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_21" data-id="EP5_21">subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_22" data-id="EP5_22">Wives, <span class="add">be in subjection</span> unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_23" data-id="EP5_23">For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, <span class="add">being</span> himself the saviour of the body. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_24" data-id="EP5_24">But as the church is subject to Christ, so <span class="add">let</span> the wives also <span class="add">be</span> to their husbands in everything. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_25" data-id="EP5_25">Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_26" data-id="EP5_26">that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_27" data-id="EP5_27">that he might present the church to himself a glorious <span class="add">church</span>, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_28" data-id="EP5_28">Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his own wife loveth himself:</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_29" data-id="EP5_29">for no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ also the church;</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_30" data-id="EP5_30">because we are members of his body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_31" data-id="EP5_31">For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_32" data-id="EP5_32">This mystery is great: but I speak in regard of Christ and of the church.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP5_33" data-id="EP5_33">Nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own wife even as himself; and <span class="add">let</span> the wife <span class="add">see</span> that she fear her husband. </span>
