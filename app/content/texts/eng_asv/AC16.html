<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_1" data-id="AC16_1">And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess that believed; but his father was a Greek. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_2" data-id="AC16_2">The same was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_3" data-id="AC16_3">Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those parts: for they all knew that his father was a Greek. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_4" data-id="AC16_4">And as they went on their way through the cities, they delivered them the decrees to keep which had been ordained of the apostles and elders that were at Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_5" data-id="AC16_5">So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_6" data-id="AC16_6">And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden of the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia; </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_7" data-id="AC16_7">and when they were come over against Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia; and the Spirit of Jesus suffered them not;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_8" data-id="AC16_8">and passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_9" data-id="AC16_9">And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: There was a man of Macedonia standing, beseeching him, and saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_10" data-id="AC16_10">And when he had seen the vision, straightway we sought to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_11" data-id="AC16_11">Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_12" data-id="AC16_12">and from thence to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the first of the district, a <span class="add">Roman</span> colony: and we were in this city tarrying certain days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_13" data-id="AC16_13">And on the sabbath day we went forth without the gate by a river side, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down, and spake unto the women that were come together. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_14" data-id="AC16_14">And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one that worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened to give heed unto the things which were spoken by Paul.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_15" data-id="AC16_15">And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide <span class="add">there</span>. And she constrained us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_16" data-id="AC16_16">And it came to pass, as we were going to the place of prayer, that a certain maid having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_17" data-id="AC16_17">The same following after Paul and us cried out, saying, These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim unto you the way of salvation. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_18" data-id="AC16_18">And this she did for many days. But Paul, being sore troubled, turned and said to the spirit, I charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that very hour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_19" data-id="AC16_19">But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they laid hold on Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers, </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_20" data-id="AC16_20">and when they had brought them unto the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_21" data-id="AC16_21">and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to receive, or to observe, being Romans.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_22" data-id="AC16_22">And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent their garments off them, and commanded to beat them with rods. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_23" data-id="AC16_23">And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_24" data-id="AC16_24">who, having received such a charge, cast them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_25" data-id="AC16_25">But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns unto God, and the prisoners were listening to them;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_26" data-id="AC16_26">and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison-house were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened; and every oneâ€™s bands were loosed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_27" data-id="AC16_27">And the jailor, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped. </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_28" data-id="AC16_28">But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_29" data-id="AC16_29">And he called for lights and sprang in, and, trembling for fear, fell down before Paul and Silas,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_30" data-id="AC16_30">and brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_31" data-id="AC16_31">And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_32" data-id="AC16_32">And they spake the word of the Lord unto him, with all that were in his house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_33" data-id="AC16_33">And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, immediately.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_34" data-id="AC16_34">And he brought them up into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his house, having believed in God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_35" data-id="AC16_35">But when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_36" data-id="AC16_36">And the jailor reported the words to Paul, <span class="add">saying</span>, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore come forth, and go in peace. </span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_37" data-id="AC16_37">But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Romans, and have cast us into prison; and do they now cast us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and bring us out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_38" data-id="AC16_38">And the serjeants reported these words unto the magistrates: and they feared when they heard that they were Romans;</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_39" data-id="AC16_39">and they came and besought them; and when they had brought them out, they asked them to go away from the city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC16_40" data-id="AC16_40">And they went out of the prison, and entered into <span class="add">the house of</span> Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.</span>
