<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_1" data-id="RM15_1">Now we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_2" data-id="RM15_2">Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, unto edifying.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_3" data-id="RM15_3">For Christ also pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_4" data-id="RM15_4">For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that through patience and through comfort of the scriptures we might have hope. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_5" data-id="RM15_5">Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_6" data-id="RM15_6">that with one accord ye may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_7" data-id="RM15_7">Wherefore receive ye one another, even as Christ also received you, to the glory of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_8" data-id="RM15_8">For I say that Christ hath been made a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises <span class="add">given</span> unto the fathers, </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_9" data-id="RM15_9">and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM15_9" data-id="RM15_9">Therefore will I give praise unto thee among the Gentiles,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM15_9" data-id="RM15_9">And sing unto thy name.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_10" data-id="RM15_10">And again he saith,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM15_10" data-id="RM15_10">Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_11" data-id="RM15_11">And again,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM15_11" data-id="RM15_11">Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles;</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM15_11" data-id="RM15_11">And let all the peoples praise him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_12" data-id="RM15_12">And again, Isaiah saith,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM15_12" data-id="RM15_12">There shall be the root of Jesse,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM15_12" data-id="RM15_12">And he that ariseth to rule over the Gentiles;</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM15_12" data-id="RM15_12">On him shall the Gentiles hope.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_13" data-id="RM15_13">Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_14" data-id="RM15_14">And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_15" data-id="RM15_15">But I write the more boldly unto you in some measure, as putting you again in remembrance, because of the grace that was given me of God, </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_16" data-id="RM15_16">that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus unto the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_17" data-id="RM15_17">I have therefore my glorying in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_18" data-id="RM15_18">For I will not dare to speak of any things save those which Christ wrought through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed, </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_19" data-id="RM15_19">in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and round about even unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ; </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_20" data-id="RM15_20">yea, making it my aim so to preach the gospel, not where Christ was <span class="add">already</span> named, that I might not build upon another man’s foundation;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_21" data-id="RM15_21">but, as it is written,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM15_21" data-id="RM15_21">They shall see, to whom no tidings of him came,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM15_21" data-id="RM15_21">And they who have not heard shall understand.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_22" data-id="RM15_22">Wherefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you:</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_23" data-id="RM15_23">but now, having no more any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come unto you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_24" data-id="RM15_24">whensoever I go unto Spain (for I hope to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first in some measure I shall have been satisfied with your company)— </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_25" data-id="RM15_25">but now, <span class="add">I say</span>, I go unto Jerusalem, ministering unto the saints.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_26" data-id="RM15_26">For it hath been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints that are at Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_27" data-id="RM15_27">Yea, it hath been their good pleasure; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it <span class="add">to them</span> also to minister unto them in carnal things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_28" data-id="RM15_28">When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by you unto Spain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_29" data-id="RM15_29">And I know that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_30" data-id="RM15_30">Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me; </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_31" data-id="RM15_31">that I may be delivered from them that are disobedient in Judæa, and <span class="add">that</span> my ministration which <span class="add">I have</span> for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_32" data-id="RM15_32">that I may come unto you in joy through the will of God, and together with you find rest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_33" data-id="RM15_33">Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</span>
