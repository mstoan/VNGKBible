<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS47_1" data-id="IS47_1">Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS47_2" data-id="IS47_2">Take the millstones, and grind meal; remove thy veil, strip off the train, uncover the leg, pass through the rivers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS47_3" data-id="IS47_3">Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and will spare no man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS47_4" data-id="IS47_4">Our Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS47_5" data-id="IS47_5">Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for thou shalt no more be called The mistress of kingdoms. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS47_6" data-id="IS47_6">I was wroth with my people, I profaned mine inheritance, and gave them into thy hand: thou didst show them no mercy; upon the aged hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS47_7" data-id="IS47_7">And thou saidst, I shall be mistress for ever; so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end thereof. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS47_8" data-id="IS47_8">Now therefore hear this, thou that art given to pleasures, that sittest securely, that sayest in thy heart, I am, and there is none else besides me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS47_9" data-id="IS47_9">but these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood; in their full measure shall they come upon thee, in the multitude of thy sorceries, and the great abundance of thine enchantments.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS47_10" data-id="IS47_10">For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness; thou hast said, None seeth me; thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee, and thou hast said in thy heart, I am, and there is none else besides me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS47_11" data-id="IS47_11">Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know the dawning thereof: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it away: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou knowest not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS47_12" data-id="IS47_12">Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast labored from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS47_13" data-id="IS47_13">Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels: let now the astrologers, the star-gazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from the things that shall come upon thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS47_14" data-id="IS47_14">Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: it shall not be a coal to warm at, nor a fire to sit before.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS47_15" data-id="IS47_15">Thus shall the things be unto thee wherein thou hast labored: they that have trafficked with thee from thy youth shall wander every one to his quarter; there shall be none to save thee.</span>
