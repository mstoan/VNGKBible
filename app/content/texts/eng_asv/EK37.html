<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_1" data-id="EK37_1">The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of Jehovah, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_2" data-id="EK37_2">And he caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_3" data-id="EK37_3">And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord Jehovah, thou knowest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_4" data-id="EK37_4">Again he said unto me, Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_5" data-id="EK37_5">Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_6" data-id="EK37_6">And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_7" data-id="EK37_7">So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and, behold, an earthquake; and the bones came together, bone to its bone. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_8" data-id="EK37_8">And I beheld, and, lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_9" data-id="EK37_9">Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_10" data-id="EK37_10">So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_11" data-id="EK37_11">Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_12" data-id="EK37_12">Therefore prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_13" data-id="EK37_13">And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, O my people. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_14" data-id="EK37_14">And I will put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I will place you in your own land: and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it and performed it, saith Jehovah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_15" data-id="EK37_15">The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_17" data-id="EK37_17">and join them for thee one to another into one stick, that they may become one in thy hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_18" data-id="EK37_18">And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not show us what thou meanest by these?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_19" data-id="EK37_19">say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them with it, <span class="add">even</span> with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_20" data-id="EK37_20">And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_21" data-id="EK37_21">And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, whither they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_22" data-id="EK37_22">and I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all; and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_23" data-id="EK37_23">neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling-places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_24" data-id="EK37_24">And my servant David shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in mine ordinances, and observe my statutes, and do them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_25" data-id="EK37_25">And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children’s children, for ever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_26" data-id="EK37_26">Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK37_27" data-id="EK37_27">My tabernacle also shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</span>
