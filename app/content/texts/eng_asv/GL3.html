<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_1" data-id="GL3_1">O foolish Galatians, who did bewitch you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth crucified?</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_2" data-id="GL3_2">This only would I learn from you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_3" data-id="GL3_3">Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now perfected in the flesh?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_4" data-id="GL3_4">Did ye suffer so many things in vain? if it be indeed in vain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_5" data-id="GL3_5">He therefore that supplieth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, <span class="add">doeth he it</span> by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_6" data-id="GL3_6">Even as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_7" data-id="GL3_7">Know therefore that they that are of faith, the same are sons of Abraham.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_8" data-id="GL3_8">And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand unto Abraham, <span class="add">saying,</span> In thee shall all the nations be blessed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_9" data-id="GL3_9">So then they that are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_10" data-id="GL3_10">For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one who continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_11" data-id="GL3_11">Now that no man is justified by the law before God, is evident: for, The righteous shall live by faith;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_12" data-id="GL3_12">and the law is not of faith; but, He that doeth them shall live in them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_13" data-id="GL3_13">Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_14" data-id="GL3_14">that upon the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_15" data-id="GL3_15">Brethren, I speak after the manner of men: Though it be but a man’s covenant, yet when it hath been confirmed, no one maketh it void, or addeth thereto. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_16" data-id="GL3_16">Now to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_17" data-id="GL3_17">Now this I say: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of none effect. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_18" data-id="GL3_18">For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but God hath granted it to Abraham by promise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_19" data-id="GL3_19">What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise hath been made; <span class="add">and it was </span> ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_20" data-id="GL3_20">Now a mediator is not <span class="add">a mediator</span> of one; but God is one.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_21" data-id="GL3_21">Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could make alive, verily righteousness would have been of the law. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_22" data-id="GL3_22">But the scriptures shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_23" data-id="GL3_23">But before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_24" data-id="GL3_24">So that the law is become our tutor <span class="add">to bring us</span> unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_25" data-id="GL3_25">But now that faith is come, we are no longer under a tutor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_26" data-id="GL3_26">For ye are all sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_27" data-id="GL3_27">For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_28" data-id="GL3_28">There can be neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female; for ye all are one <span class="add">man</span> in Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_29" data-id="GL3_29">And if ye are Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, heirs according to promise.</span>
