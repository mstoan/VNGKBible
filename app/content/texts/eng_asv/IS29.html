<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS29_2" data-id="IS29_2">then will I distress Ariel, and there shall be mourning and lamentation; and she shall be unto me as Ariel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS29_3" data-id="IS29_3">And I will encamp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with posted troops, and I will raise siege works against thee. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS29_4" data-id="IS29_4">And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust; and thy voice shall be as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS29_5" data-id="IS29_5">But the multitude of thy foes shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones as chaff that passeth away: yea, it shall be in an instant suddenly. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS29_6" data-id="IS29_6">She shall be visited of Jehovah of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS29_7" data-id="IS29_7">And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her stronghold, and that distress her, shall be as a dream, a vision of the night. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS29_8" data-id="IS29_8">And it shall be as when a hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS29_9" data-id="IS29_9">Tarry ye and wonder; take your pleasure and be blind: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS29_10" data-id="IS29_10">For Jehovah hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes, the prophets; and your heads, the seers, hath he covered. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS29_11" data-id="IS29_11">And all vision is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I cannot, for it is sealed:</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS29_12" data-id="IS29_12">and the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I am not learned.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS29_13" data-id="IS29_13">And the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw nigh <span class="add">unto me</span>, and with their mouth and with their lips to honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment of men which hath been taught <span class="add">them</span>; </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS29_14" data-id="IS29_14">therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS29_15" data-id="IS29_15">Woe unto them that hide deep their counsel from Jehovah, and whose works are in the dark, and that say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us? </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS29_16" data-id="IS29_16">Ye turn things upside down! Shall the potter be esteemed as clay; that the thing made should say of him that made it, He made me not; or the thing formed say of him that formed it, He hath no understanding?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS29_17" data-id="IS29_17">Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest? </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS29_18" data-id="IS29_18">And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS29_19" data-id="IS29_19">The meek also shall increase their joy in Jehovah, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS29_20" data-id="IS29_20">For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scoffer ceaseth, and all they that watch for iniquity are cut off;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS29_21" data-id="IS29_21">that make a man an offender in <span class="add">his</span> cause, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just with a thing of nought. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS29_22" data-id="IS29_22">Therefore thus saith Jehovah, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS29_23" data-id="IS29_23">But when he seeth his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name; yea, they shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall stand in awe of the God of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS29_24" data-id="IS29_24">They also that err in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmur shall receive instruction.</span>
