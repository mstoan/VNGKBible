<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v K213_18" data-id="K213_18">And he said, Take the arrows; and he took them. And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground; and he smote thrice, and stayed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v K213_19" data-id="K213_19">And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times: then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it; whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.</span>
