<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C116_2" data-id="C116_2">Upon the first day of the week let each one of you lay by him in store, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come.

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C116_7" data-id="C116_7">For I do not wish to see you now by the way; for I hope to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C116_8" data-id="C116_8">But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C116_9" data-id="C116_9">for a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C116_11" data-id="C116_11">let no man therefore despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come unto me: for I expect him with the brethren. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C116_12" data-id="C116_12">But as touching Apollos the brother, I besought him much to come unto you with the brethren: and it was not at all <span class="add">his</span> will to come now; but he will come when he shall have opportunity.

</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C116_16" data-id="C116_16">that ye also be in subjection unto such, and to every one that helpeth in the work and laboreth.</span>
