<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT8_1" data-id="DT8_1">All the commandment which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which Jehovah sware unto your fathers. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT8_2" data-id="DT8_2">And thou shalt remember all the way which Jehovah thy God hath led thee these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble thee, to prove thee, to know what was in thy heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT8_3" data-id="DT8_3">And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by everything that proceedeth out of the mouth of Jehovah doth man live. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT8_4" data-id="DT8_4">Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT8_5" data-id="DT8_5">And thou shalt consider in thy heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so Jehovah thy God chasteneth thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT8_6" data-id="DT8_6">And thou shalt keep the commandments of Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT8_7" data-id="DT8_7">For Jehovah thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, flowing forth in valleys and hills; </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT8_8" data-id="DT8_8">a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig-trees and pomegranates; a land of olive-trees and honey;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT8_9" data-id="DT8_9">a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig copper. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT8_10" data-id="DT8_10">And thou shalt eat and be full, and thou shalt bless Jehovah thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT8_14" data-id="DT8_14">then thy heart be lifted up, and thou forget Jehovah thy God, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT8_15" data-id="DT8_15">who led thee through the great and terrible wilderness, <span class="add">wherein were</span> fiery serpents and scorpions, and thirsty ground where was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint; </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT8_16" data-id="DT8_16">who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not; that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end: </span>
