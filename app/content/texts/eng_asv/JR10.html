<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_1" data-id="JR10_1">Hear ye the word which Jehovah speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_2" data-id="JR10_2">thus saith Jehovah, Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the nations are dismayed at them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_3" data-id="JR10_3">For the customs of the peoples are vanity; for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with the axe. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_4" data-id="JR10_4">They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_5" data-id="JR10_5">They are like a palm-tree, of turned work, and speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither is it in them to do good.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_6" data-id="JR10_6">There is none like unto thee, O Jehovah; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_7" data-id="JR10_7">Who should not fear thee, O King of the nations? for to thee doth it appertain; forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royal estate, there is none like unto thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_8" data-id="JR10_8">But they are together brutish and foolish: the instruction of idols! it is but a stock.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_9" data-id="JR10_9">There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith; blue and purple for their clothing; they are all the work of skilful men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_10" data-id="JR10_10">But Jehovah is the true God; he is the living God, and an everlasting King: at his wrath the earth trembleth, and the nations are not able to abide his indignation. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_11" data-id="JR10_11">Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_12" data-id="JR10_12">He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding hath he stretched out the heavens: </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_13" data-id="JR10_13">when he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_14" data-id="JR10_14">Every man is become brutish <span class="add">and is</span> without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his graven image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_15" data-id="JR10_15">They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_16" data-id="JR10_16">The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance: Jehovah of hosts is his name. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_17" data-id="JR10_17">Gather up thy wares out of the land, O thou that abidest in the siege.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_18" data-id="JR10_18">For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they may feel <span class="add">it</span>. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_19" data-id="JR10_19">Woe is me because of my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is <span class="add">my</span> grief, and I must bear it. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_20" data-id="JR10_20">My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth from me, and they are not: there is none to spread my tent any more, and to set up my curtains. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_21" data-id="JR10_21">For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not inquired of Jehovah: therefore they have not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_22" data-id="JR10_22">The voice of tidings, behold, it cometh, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling-place of jackals. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_23" data-id="JR10_23">O Jehovah, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_24" data-id="JR10_24">O Jehovah, correct me, but in measure: not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR10_25" data-id="JR10_25">Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have devoured Jacob, yea, they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation.</span>
