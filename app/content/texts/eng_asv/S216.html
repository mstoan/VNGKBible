<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_1" data-id="S216_1">And when David was a little past the top <span class="add">of the ascent</span>, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_2" data-id="S216_2">And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses are for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_3" data-id="S216_3">And the king said, And where is thy master’s son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem; for he said, To-day will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_4" data-id="S216_4">Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine is all that pertaineth unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I do obeisance; let me find favor in thy sight, my lord, O king. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_5" data-id="S216_5">And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and cursed still as he came.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_6" data-id="S216_6">And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_7" data-id="S216_7">And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_8" data-id="S216_8">Jehovah hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and Jehovah hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and, behold, thou art <span class="add">taken</span> in thine own mischief, because thou art a man of blood.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_9" data-id="S216_9">Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_10" data-id="S216_10">And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? Because he curseth, and because Jehovah hath said unto him, Curse David; who then shall say, Wherefore hast thou done so?</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_11" data-id="S216_11">And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more <span class="add">may</span> this Benjamite now <span class="add">do it</span>? let him alone, and let him curse; for Jehovah hath bidden him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_12" data-id="S216_12">It may be that Jehovah will look on the wrong done unto me, and that Jehovah will requite me good for <span class="add">his</span> cursing of me this day. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_13" data-id="S216_13">So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill-side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_14" data-id="S216_14">And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_15" data-id="S216_15">And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_16" data-id="S216_16">And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, <span class="add">Long</span> live the king, <span class="add">Long</span> live the king. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_17" data-id="S216_17">And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_18" data-id="S216_18">And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom Jehovah, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I abide. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_19" data-id="S216_19">And again, whom should I serve? <span class="add">should I</span> not <span class="add">serve </span> in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father’s presence, so will I be in thy presence.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_20" data-id="S216_20">Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what we shall do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_21" data-id="S216_21">And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father’s concubines, that he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then will the hands of all that are with thee be strong.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_22" data-id="S216_22">So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v S216_23" data-id="S216_23">And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom. </span>
