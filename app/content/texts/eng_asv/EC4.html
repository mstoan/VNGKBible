<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_1" data-id="EC4_1">Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and, behold, the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_2" data-id="EC4_2">Wherefore I praised the dead that have been long dead more than the living that are yet alive;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_3" data-id="EC4_3">yea, better than them both <span class="add">did I esteem</span> him that hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_4" data-id="EC4_4">Then I saw all labor and every skilful work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_5" data-id="EC4_5">The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_6" data-id="EC4_6">Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labor and striving after wind.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_7" data-id="EC4_7">Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_8" data-id="EC4_8">There is one that is alone, and he hath not a second; yea, he hath neither son nor brother; yet is there no end of all his labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with riches. For whom then, <span class="add">saith he</span>, do I labor, and deprive my soul of good? This also is vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_9" data-id="EC4_9">Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_10" data-id="EC4_10">For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and hath not another to lift him up. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_11" data-id="EC4_11">Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one be warm <span class="add">alone</span>? </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_12" data-id="EC4_12">And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_13" data-id="EC4_13">Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king, who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_14" data-id="EC4_14">For out of prison he came forth to be king; yea, even in his kingdom he was born poor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_15" data-id="EC4_15">I saw all the living that walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the second, that stood up in his stead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_16" data-id="EC4_16">There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was: yet they that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind. </span>
