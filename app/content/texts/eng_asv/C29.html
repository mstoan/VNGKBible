<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_1" data-id="C29_1">For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_2" data-id="C29_2">for I know your readiness, of which I glory on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia hath been prepared for a year past; and your zeal hath stirred up very many of them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_3" data-id="C29_3">But I have sent the brethren, that our glorying on your behalf may not be made void in this respect; that, even as I said, ye may be prepared: </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_4" data-id="C29_4">lest by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be put to shame in this confidence. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_5" data-id="C29_5">I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your aforepromised bounty, that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty, and not of extortion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_6" data-id="C29_6">But this <span class="add">I say,</span> He that soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_7" data-id="C29_7"> <span class="add">Let</span> each man <span class="add">do</span> according as he hath purposed in his heart: not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_8" data-id="C29_8">And God is able to make all grace abound unto you; that ye, having always all sufficiency in everything, may abound unto every good work: </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_9" data-id="C29_9">as it is written,</span>

<span class="v C29_9" data-id="C29_9">He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the poor;</span>

<div class="q">
<span class="v C29_9" data-id="C29_9">His righteousness abideth for ever.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_10" data-id="C29_10">And he that supplieth seed to the sower and bread for food, shall supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness: </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_11" data-id="C29_11">ye being enriched in everything unto all liberality, which worketh through us thanksgiving to God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_12" data-id="C29_12">For the ministration of this service not only filleth up the measure of the wants of the saints, but aboundeth also through many thanksgivings unto God; </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_13" data-id="C29_13">seeing that through the proving <span class="add">of you</span> by this ministration they glorify God for the obedience of your confession unto the gospel of Christ, and for the liberality of <span class="add">your</span> contribution unto them and unto all;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C29_14" data-id="C29_14">while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, long after you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you. </span>
