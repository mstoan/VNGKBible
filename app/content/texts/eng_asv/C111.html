<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_1" data-id="C111_1">Be ye imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_2" data-id="C111_2">Now I praise you that ye remember me in all things, and hold fast the traditions, even as I delivered them to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_3" data-id="C111_3">But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_4" data-id="C111_4">Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoreth his head.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_5" data-id="C111_5">But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoreth her head; for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaven. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_6" data-id="C111_6">For if a woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn: but if it is a shame to a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_7" data-id="C111_7">For a man indeed ought not to have his head veiled, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_8" data-id="C111_8">For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_9" data-id="C111_9">for neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_10" data-id="C111_10">for this cause ought the woman to have <span class="add">a sign of</span> authority on her head, because of the angels.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_11" data-id="C111_11">Nevertheless, neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_12" data-id="C111_12">For as the woman is of the man, so is the man also by the woman; but all things are of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_13" data-id="C111_13">Judge ye in yourselves: is it seemly that a woman pray unto God unveiled?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_14" data-id="C111_14">Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a dishonor to him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_15" data-id="C111_15">But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_16" data-id="C111_16">But if any man seemeth to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_17" data-id="C111_17">But in giving you this charge, I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better but for the worse.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_18" data-id="C111_18">For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and I partly believe it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_19" data-id="C111_19">For there must be also factions among you, that they that are approved may be made manifest among you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_20" data-id="C111_20">When therefore ye assemble yourselves together, it is not possible to eat the Lord’s supper:</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_21" data-id="C111_21">for in your eating each one taketh before <span class="add">other</span> his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_22" data-id="C111_22">What, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this I praise you not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_23" data-id="C111_23">For I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread; </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_24" data-id="C111_24">and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_25" data-id="C111_25">In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye drink <span class="add">it</span>, in remembrance of me. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_26" data-id="C111_26">For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord’s death till he come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_27" data-id="C111_27">Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_28" data-id="C111_28">But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_29" data-id="C111_29">For he that eateth and drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_30" data-id="C111_30">For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_31" data-id="C111_31">But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_32" data-id="C111_32">But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_33" data-id="C111_33">Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait one for another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_34" data-id="C111_34">If any man is hungry, let him eat at home; that your coming together be not unto judgment. And the rest will I set in order whensoever I come. </span>
