<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_22" data-id="NU22_22">And God’s anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of Jehovah placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_23" data-id="NU22_23">And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_24" data-id="NU22_24">Then the angel of Jehovah stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_25" data-id="NU22_25">And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah, and she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall: and he smote her again. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_26" data-id="NU22_26">And the angel of Jehovah went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_27" data-id="NU22_27">And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah, and she lay down under Balaam: and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with his staff. </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_28" data-id="NU22_28">And Jehovah opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times? </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_29" data-id="NU22_29">And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in my hand, for now I had killed thee. </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_30" data-id="NU22_30">And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden all thy life long unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? and he said, Nay. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_31" data-id="NU22_31">Then Jehovah opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of Jehovah standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face. </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_32" data-id="NU22_32">And the angel of Jehovah said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I am come forth for an adversary, because thy way is perverse before me: </span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_33" data-id="NU22_33">and the ass saw me, and turned aside before me these three times: unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I had even slain thee, and saved her alive. </span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_34" data-id="NU22_34">And Balaam said unto the angel of Jehovah, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again. </span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_35" data-id="NU22_35">And the angel of Jehovah said unto Balaam, Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_36" data-id="NU22_36">And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border. </span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_37" data-id="NU22_37">And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honor? </span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_38" data-id="NU22_38">And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to speak anything? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak. </span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_39" data-id="NU22_39">And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kiriath-huzoth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_40" data-id="NU22_40">And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU22_41" data-id="NU22_41">And it came to pass in the morning, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from thence the utmost part of the people. </span>
