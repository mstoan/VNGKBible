<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS53_1" data-id="IS53_1">Who hath believed our message? and to whom hath the arm of Jehovah been revealed?</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS53_2" data-id="IS53_2">For he grew up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS53_3" data-id="IS53_3">He was despised, and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and as one from whom men hide their face he was despised; and we esteemed him not. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS53_4" data-id="IS53_4">Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS53_5" data-id="IS53_5">But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS53_6" data-id="IS53_6">All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and Jehovah hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS53_7" data-id="IS53_7">He was oppressed, yet when he was afflicted he opened not his mouth; as a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that before its shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS53_8" data-id="IS53_8">By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who <span class="add">among them</span> considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people to whom the stroke <span class="add">was due</span>? </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS53_9" data-id="IS53_9">And they made his grave with the wicked, and with a rich man in his death; although he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS53_10" data-id="IS53_10">Yet it pleased Jehovah to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see <span class="add">his </span> seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS53_11" data-id="IS53_11">He shall see of the travail of his soul, <span class="add">and</span> shall be satisfied: by the knowledge of himself shall my righteous servant justify many; and he shall bear their iniquities. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS53_12" data-id="IS53_12">Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he poured out his soul unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors: yet he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors. </span>
