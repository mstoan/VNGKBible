<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_2" data-id="ZP1_2">I will utterly consume all things from off the face of the ground, saith Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_3" data-id="ZP1_3">I will consume man and beast; I will consume the birds of the heavens, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the face of the ground, saith Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_4" data-id="ZP1_4">And I will stretch out my hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, <span class="add">and</span> the name of the Chemarim with the priests;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_5" data-id="ZP1_5">and them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship, that swear to Jehovah and swear by Malcam; </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_6" data-id="ZP1_6">and them that are turned back from following Jehovah; and those that have not sought Jehovah, nor inquired after him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_7" data-id="ZP1_7">Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord Jehovah; for the day of Jehovah is at hand: for Jehovah hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath consecrated his guests. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_8" data-id="ZP1_8">And it shall come to pass in the day of Jehovah’s sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king’s sons, and all such as are clothed with foreign apparel. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_9" data-id="ZP1_9">And in that day I will punish all those that leap over the threshold, that fill their master’s house with violence and deceit. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_10" data-id="ZP1_10">And in that day, saith Jehovah, there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and a wailing from the second quarter, and a great crashing from the hills. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_11" data-id="ZP1_11">Wail, ye inhabitants of Maktesh; for all the people of Canaan are undone; all they that were laden with silver are cut off. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_12" data-id="ZP1_12">And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lamps; and I will punish the men that are settled on their lees, that say in their heart, Jehovah will not do good, neither will he do evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_13" data-id="ZP1_13">And their wealth shall become a spoil, and their houses a desolation: yea, they shall build houses, but shall not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but shall not drink the wine thereof.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_14" data-id="ZP1_14">The great day of Jehovah is near, it is near and hasteth greatly, <span class="add">even</span> the voice of the day of Jehovah; the mighty man crieth there bitterly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_15" data-id="ZP1_15">That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_16" data-id="ZP1_16">a day of the trumpet and alarm, against the fortified cities, and against the high battlements.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_17" data-id="ZP1_17">And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against Jehovah; and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as dung.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP1_18" data-id="ZP1_18">Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of Jehovah’s wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he will make an end, yea, a terrible end, of all them that dwell in the land.</span>
