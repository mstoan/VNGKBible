<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_39" data-id="LK4_39">And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she rose up and ministered unto them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_40" data-id="LK4_40">And when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_41" data-id="LK4_41">And demons also came out from many, crying out, and saying, Thou art the Son of God. And rebuking them, he suffered them not to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ. </span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK4_42" data-id="LK4_42">And when it was day, he came out and went into a desert place: and the multitudes sought after him, and came unto him, and would have stayed him, that he should not go from them. </span>
