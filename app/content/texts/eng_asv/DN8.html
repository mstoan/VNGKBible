<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_1" data-id="DN8_1">In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me, Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_2" data-id="DN8_2">And I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_3" data-id="DN8_3">Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_4" data-id="DN8_4">I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_5" data-id="DN8_5">And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_6" data-id="DN8_6">And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_7" data-id="DN8_7">And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_8" data-id="DN8_8">And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable <span class="add">horns</span> toward the four winds of heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_9" data-id="DN8_9">And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious <span class="add">land</span>. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_10" data-id="DN8_10">And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_11" data-id="DN8_11">Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and it took away from him the continual <span class="add">burnt-offering</span>, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_12" data-id="DN8_12">And the host was given over <span class="add">to it</span> together with the continual <span class="add">burnt-offering</span> through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it did <span class="add">its pleasure</span> and prospered. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_13" data-id="DN8_13">Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said unto that certain one who spake, How long shall be the vision <span class="add">concerning </span> the continual <span class="add">burnt-offering</span>, and the transgression that maketh desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_14" data-id="DN8_14">And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings <span class="add">and</span> mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_15" data-id="DN8_15">And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_16" data-id="DN8_16">And I heard a man’s voice between <span class="add">the banks of</span> the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_17" data-id="DN8_17">So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was affrighted, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_18" data-id="DN8_18">Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_19" data-id="DN8_19">And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_20" data-id="DN8_20">The ram which thou sawest, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_21" data-id="DN8_21">And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_22" data-id="DN8_22">And as for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_23" data-id="DN8_23">And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_24" data-id="DN8_24">And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do <span class="add">his pleasure</span>; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_25" data-id="DN8_25">And through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in <span class="add">their</span> security shall he destroy many: he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_26" data-id="DN8_26">And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true: but shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days <span class="add">to come</span>. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN8_27" data-id="DN8_27">And I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king’s business: and I wondered at the vision, but none understood it. </span>
