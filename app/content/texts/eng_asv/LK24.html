<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_1" data-id="LK24_1">But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came unto the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_2" data-id="LK24_2">And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_3" data-id="LK24_3">And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_4" data-id="LK24_4">And it came to pass, while they were perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_5" data-id="LK24_5">and as they were affrighted and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_6" data-id="LK24_6">He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_7" data-id="LK24_7">saying that the Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_8" data-id="LK24_8">And they remembered his words,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_9" data-id="LK24_9">and returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_10" data-id="LK24_10">Now they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the <span class="add">mother </span> of James: and the other women with them told these things unto the apostles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_11" data-id="LK24_11">And these words appeared in their sight as idle talk; and they disbelieved them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_12" data-id="LK24_12">But Peter arose, and ran unto the tomb; and stooping and looking in, he seeth the linen cloths by themselves; and he departed to his home, wondering at that which was come to pass. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_13" data-id="LK24_13">And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was threescore furlongs from Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_14" data-id="LK24_14">And they communed with each other of all these things which had happened.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_15" data-id="LK24_15">And it came to pass, while they communed and questioned together, that Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_16" data-id="LK24_16">But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_17" data-id="LK24_17">And he said unto them, What communications are these that ye have one with another, as ye walk? And they stood still, looking sad. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_18" data-id="LK24_18">And one of them, named Cleopas, answering said unto him, Dost thou alone sojourn in Jerusalem and not know the things which are come to pass there in these days? </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_19" data-id="LK24_19">And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_20" data-id="LK24_20">and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_21" data-id="LK24_21">But we hoped that it was he who should redeem Israel. Yea and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things came to pass. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_22" data-id="LK24_22">Moreover certain women of our company amazed us, having been early at the tomb;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_23" data-id="LK24_23">and when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_24" data-id="LK24_24">And certain of them that were with us went to the tomb, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_25" data-id="LK24_25">And he said unto them, O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_26" data-id="LK24_26">Behooved it not the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_27" data-id="LK24_27">And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_28" data-id="LK24_28">And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go further.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_29" data-id="LK24_29">And they constrained him, saying, Abide with us; for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in to abide with them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_30" data-id="LK24_30">And it came to pass, when he had sat down with them to meat, he took the bread and blessed; and breaking <span class="add">it</span> he gave to them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_31" data-id="LK24_31">And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_32" data-id="LK24_32">And they said one to another, Was not our heart burning within us, while he spake to us in the way, while he opened to us the scriptures? </span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_33" data-id="LK24_33">And they rose up that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, </span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_34" data-id="LK24_34">saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_35" data-id="LK24_35">And they rehearsed the things <span class="add">that happened</span> in the way, and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread. </span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_36" data-id="LK24_36">And as they spake these things, he himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace <span class="add">be</span> unto you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_37" data-id="LK24_37">But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_38" data-id="LK24_38">And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do questionings arise in your heart?</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_39" data-id="LK24_39">See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold me having. </span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_40" data-id="LK24_40">And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_41" data-id="LK24_41">And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here anything to eat?</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_42" data-id="LK24_42">And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_43" data-id="LK24_43">And he took it, and ate before them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_44" data-id="LK24_44">And he said unto them, These are my words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_45" data-id="LK24_45">Then opened he their mind, that they might understand the scriptures;</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_46" data-id="LK24_46">and he said unto them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day;</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_47" data-id="LK24_47">and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_48" data-id="LK24_48">Ye are witnesses of these things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_49" data-id="LK24_49">And behold, I send forth the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city, until ye be clothed with power from on high. </span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_50" data-id="LK24_50">And he led them out until <span class="add">they were</span> over against Bethany: and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_51" data-id="LK24_51">And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_52" data-id="LK24_52">And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK24_53" data-id="LK24_53">and were continually in the temple, blessing God.</span>
