<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_4" data-id="LK13_4">Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them, think ye that they were offenders above all the men that dwell in Jerusalem? </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_5" data-id="LK13_5">I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_6" data-id="LK13_6">And he spake this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came seeking fruit thereon, and found none. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_7" data-id="LK13_7">And he said unto the vinedresser, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why doth it also cumber the ground? </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_8" data-id="LK13_8">And he answering saith unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_9" data-id="LK13_9">and if it bear fruit thenceforth, <span class="add">well</span>; but if not, thou shalt cut it down.</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_12" data-id="LK13_12">And when Jesus saw her, he called her, and said to her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_15" data-id="LK13_15">But the Lord answered him, and said, Ye hypocrites, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering? </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_16" data-id="LK13_16">And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound, lo, <span class="add">these</span> eighteen years, to have been loosed from this bond on the day of the sabbath?</span>

<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_19" data-id="LK13_19">It is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his own garden; and it grew, and became a tree; and the birds of the heaven lodged in the branches thereof. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_20" data-id="LK13_20">And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_21" data-id="LK13_21">It is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_22" data-id="LK13_22">And he went on his way through cities and villages, teaching, and journeying on unto Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_23" data-id="LK13_23">And one said unto him, Lord, are they few that are saved? And he said unto them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_24" data-id="LK13_24">Strive to enter in by the narrow door: for many, I say unto you, shall seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_25" data-id="LK13_25">When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open to us; and he shall answer and say to you, I know you not whence ye are;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_26" data-id="LK13_26">then shall ye begin to say, We did eat and drink in thy presence, and thou didst teach in our streets;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_27" data-id="LK13_27">and he shall say, I tell you, I know not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_28" data-id="LK13_28">There shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and yourselves cast forth without.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_29" data-id="LK13_29">And they shall come from the east and west, and from the north and south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_30" data-id="LK13_30">And behold, there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be last.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_31" data-id="LK13_31">In that very hour there came certain Pharisees, saying to him, Get thee out, and go hence: for Herod would fain kill thee. </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_32" data-id="LK13_32">And he said unto them, Go and say to that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third <span class="add">day</span> I am perfected. </span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_33" data-id="LK13_33">Nevertheless I must go on my way to-day and to-morrow and the <span class="add">day</span> following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_34" data-id="LK13_34">O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killeth the prophets, and stoneth them that are sent unto her! how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen <span class="add">gathereth</span> her own brood under her wings, and ye would not!</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK13_35" data-id="LK13_35">Behold, your house is left unto you <span class="add">desolate</span>: and I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until ye shall say, Blessed <span class="add">is</span> he that cometh in the name of the Lord. </span>
