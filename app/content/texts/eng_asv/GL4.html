<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_1" data-id="GL4_1">But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a bondservant though he is lord of all;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_2" data-id="GL4_2">but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed of the father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_3" data-id="GL4_3">So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the rudiments of the world:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_4" data-id="GL4_4">but when the fulness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_5" data-id="GL4_5">that he might redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_6" data-id="GL4_6">And because ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_7" data-id="GL4_7">So that thou art no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_8" data-id="GL4_8">Howbeit at that time, not knowing God, ye were in bondage to them that by nature are no gods:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_9" data-id="GL4_9">but now that ye have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how turn ye back again to the weak and beggarly rudiments, whereunto ye desire to be in bondage over again? </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_10" data-id="GL4_10">Ye observe days, and months, and seasons, and years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_11" data-id="GL4_11">I am afraid of you, lest by any means I have bestowed labor upon you in vain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_12" data-id="GL4_12">I beseech you, brethren, become as I <span class="add">am</span>, for I also <span class="add">am become</span> as ye <span class="add">are</span>. Ye did me no wrong: </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_13" data-id="GL4_13">but ye know that because of an infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you the first time:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_14" data-id="GL4_14">and that which was a temptation to you in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but ye received me as an angel of God, <span class="add">even</span> as Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_15" data-id="GL4_15">Where then is that gratulation of yourselves? for I bear you witness, that, if possible, ye would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_16" data-id="GL4_16">So then am I become your enemy, by telling you the truth?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_17" data-id="GL4_17">They zealously seek you in no good way; nay, they desire to shut you out, that ye may seek them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_18" data-id="GL4_18">But it is good to be zealously sought in a good matter at all times, and not only when I am present with you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_19" data-id="GL4_19">My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in youâ€”</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_20" data-id="GL4_20">but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone; for I am perplexed about you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_21" data-id="GL4_21">Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_22" data-id="GL4_22">For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the freewoman.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_23" data-id="GL4_23">Howbeit the <span class="add">son</span> by the handmaid is born after the flesh; but the <span class="add">son</span> by the freewoman <span class="add">is born</span> through promise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_24" data-id="GL4_24">Which things contain an allegory: for these <span class="add">women</span> are two covenants; one from mount Sinai, bearing children unto bondage, which is Hagar. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_25" data-id="GL4_25">Now this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia and answereth to the Jerusalem that now is: for she is in bondage with her children. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_26" data-id="GL4_26">But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is our mother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_27" data-id="GL4_27">For it is written,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v GL4_27" data-id="GL4_27">Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not;</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v GL4_27" data-id="GL4_27">Break forth and cry, thou that travailest not:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v GL4_27" data-id="GL4_27">For more are the children of the desolate than of her that hath the husband.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_28" data-id="GL4_28">Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_29" data-id="GL4_29">But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him <span class="add">that was born</span> after the Spirit, so also it is now. </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_30" data-id="GL4_30">Howbeit what saith the scripture? Cast out the handmaid and her son: for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with the son of the freewoman. </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL4_31" data-id="GL4_31">Wherefore, brethren, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the freewoman.</span>
