<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_1" data-id="AC8_1">And Saul was consenting unto his death. And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church which was in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judæa and Samaria, except the apostles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_2" data-id="AC8_2">And devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_3" data-id="AC8_3">But Saul laid waste the church, entering into every house, and dragging men and women committed them to prison.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_4" data-id="AC8_4">They therefore that were scattered abroad went about preaching the word.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_5" data-id="AC8_5">And Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed unto them the Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_6" data-id="AC8_6">And the multitudes gave heed with one accord unto the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard, and saw the signs which he did. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_7" data-id="AC8_7">For <span class="add">from</span> many of those that had unclean spirits, they came out, crying with a loud voice: and many that were palsied, and that were lame, were healed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_8" data-id="AC8_8">And there was much joy in that city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_9" data-id="AC8_9">But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who beforetime in the city used sorcery, and amazed the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one: </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_10" data-id="AC8_10">to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that power of God which is called Great.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_11" data-id="AC8_11">And they gave heed to him, because that of long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_12" data-id="AC8_12">But when they believed Philip preaching good tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_13" data-id="AC8_13">And Simon also himself believed: and being baptized, he continued with Philip; and beholding signs and great miracles wrought, he was amazed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_14" data-id="AC8_14">Now when the apostles that were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_15" data-id="AC8_15">who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit:</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_16" data-id="AC8_16">for as yet it was fallen upon none of them: only they had been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_17" data-id="AC8_17">Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_18" data-id="AC8_18">Now when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_19" data-id="AC8_19">saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_20" data-id="AC8_20">But Peter said unto him, Thy silver perish with thee, because thou hast thought to obtain the gift of God with money.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_21" data-id="AC8_21">Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right before God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_22" data-id="AC8_22">Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray the Lord, if perhaps the thought of thy heart shall be forgiven thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_23" data-id="AC8_23">For I see that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_24" data-id="AC8_24">And Simon answered and said, Pray ye for me to the Lord, that none of the things which ye have spoken come upon me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_25" data-id="AC8_25">They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_26" data-id="AC8_26">But an angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza: the same is desert. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_27" data-id="AC8_27">And he arose and went: and behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_28" data-id="AC8_28">and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_29" data-id="AC8_29">And the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_30" data-id="AC8_30">And Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_31" data-id="AC8_31">And he said, How can I, except some one shall guide me? And he besought Philip to come up and sit with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_32" data-id="AC8_32">Now the passage of the scripture which he was reading was this,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC8_32" data-id="AC8_32">He was led as a sheep to the slaughter;</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC8_32" data-id="AC8_32">And as a lamb before his shearer is dumb,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC8_32" data-id="AC8_32">So he openeth not his mouth:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_33" data-id="AC8_33">In his humiliation his judgment was taken away:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC8_33" data-id="AC8_33">His generation who shall declare?</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC8_33" data-id="AC8_33">For his life is taken from the earth.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_34" data-id="AC8_34">And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other?</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_35" data-id="AC8_35">And Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this scripture, preached unto him Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_36" data-id="AC8_36">And as they went on the way, they came unto a certain water; and the eunuch saith, Behold, <span class="add">here is</span> water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? </span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_37" data-id="AC8_37"> <span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span><span class="note" id="note-3"><a class="key" href="#footnote-3">And</a></span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_38" data-id="AC8_38">And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_39" data-id="AC8_39">And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went on his way rejoicing. </span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC8_40" data-id="AC8_40">But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Cæsarea.</span>
