<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_1" data-id="HB7_1">For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_2" data-id="HB7_2">to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is, King of peace; </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_3" data-id="HB7_3">without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like unto the Son of God), abideth a priest continually. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_4" data-id="HB7_4">Now consider how great this man was, unto whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the chief spoils.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_5" data-id="HB7_5">And they indeed of the sons of Levi that receive the priestâ€™s office have commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though these have come out of the loins of Abraham:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_6" data-id="HB7_6">but he whose genealogy is not counted from them hath taken tithes of Abraham, and hath blessed him that hath the promises.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_7" data-id="HB7_7">But without any dispute the less is blessed of the better.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_8" data-id="HB7_8">And here men that die receive tithes; but there one, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_9" data-id="HB7_9">And, so to say, through Abraham even Levi, who receiveth tithes, hath paid tithes;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_10" data-id="HB7_10">for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_11" data-id="HB7_11">Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it hath the people received the law), what further need <span class="add">was there </span> that another priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be reckoned after the order of Aaron? </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_12" data-id="HB7_12">For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_13" data-id="HB7_13">For he of whom these things are said belongeth to another tribe, from which no man hath given attendance at the altar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_14" data-id="HB7_14">For it is evident that our Lord hath sprung out of Judah; as to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priests.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_15" data-id="HB7_15">And <span class="add">what we say</span> is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there ariseth another priest, </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_16" data-id="HB7_16">who hath been made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life:</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_17" data-id="HB7_17">for it is witnessed <span class="add">of him,</span></span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB7_17" data-id="HB7_17">Thou art a priest for ever</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB7_17" data-id="HB7_17">After the order of Melchizedek.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_18" data-id="HB7_18">For there is a disannulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_19" data-id="HB7_19">(for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw nigh unto God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_20" data-id="HB7_20">And inasmuch as <span class="add">it is</span> not without the taking of an oath</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_21" data-id="HB7_21">(for they indeed have been made priests without an oath; but he with an oath by him that saith of him,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB7_21" data-id="HB7_21">The Lord sware and will not repent himself,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB7_21" data-id="HB7_21">Thou art a priest for ever);</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_22" data-id="HB7_22">by so much also hath Jesus become the surety of a better covenant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_23" data-id="HB7_23">And they indeed have been made priests many in number, because that by death they are hindered from continuing:</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_24" data-id="HB7_24">but he, because he abideth for ever, hath his priesthood unchangeable.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_25" data-id="HB7_25">Wherefore also he is able to save to the uttermost them that draw near unto God through him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_26" data-id="HB7_26">For such a high priest became us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_27" data-id="HB7_27">who needeth not daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the <span class="add">sins</span> of the people: for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB7_28" data-id="HB7_28">For the law appointeth men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law, <span class="add">appointeth</span> a Son, perfected for evermore. </span>
