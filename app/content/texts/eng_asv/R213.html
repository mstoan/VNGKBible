<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_1" data-id="R213_1">In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_2" data-id="R213_2">Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his motherâ€™s name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_3" data-id="R213_3">And Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_4" data-id="R213_4">And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel: </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_5" data-id="R213_5">Ought ye not to know that Jehovah, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt? </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_6" data-id="R213_6">Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_7" data-id="R213_7">And there were gathered unto him worthless men, base fellows, that strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_8" data-id="R213_8">And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David; and ye are a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_9" data-id="R213_9">Have ye not driven out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made you priests after the manner of the peoples of <span class="add">other </span> lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of <span class="add">them that are </span> no gods. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_10" data-id="R213_10">But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and <span class="add">we have</span> priests ministering unto Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_11" data-id="R213_11">and they burn unto Jehovah every morning and every evening burnt-offerings and sweet incense: the showbread also <span class="add">set they </span> in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of Jehovah our God; but ye have forsaken him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_12" data-id="R213_12">And, behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against Jehovah, the God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.</span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_13" data-id="R213_13">But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_14" data-id="R213_14">And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried unto Jehovah, and the priests sounded with the trumpets. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_15" data-id="R213_15">Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_16" data-id="R213_16">And the children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_17" data-id="R213_17">And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_18" data-id="R213_18">Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon Jehovah, the God of their fathers. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_19" data-id="R213_19">And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephron with the towns thereof. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_20" data-id="R213_20">Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and Jehovah smote him, and he died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_21" data-id="R213_21">But Abijah waxed mighty, and took unto himself fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_22" data-id="R213_22">And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.</span>
