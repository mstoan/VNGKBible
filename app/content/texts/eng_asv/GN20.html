<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_1" data-id="GN20_1">And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the South, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_2" data-id="GN20_2">And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_3" data-id="GN20_3">But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, because of the woman whom thou hast taken; for she is a man’s wife. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_4" data-id="GN20_4">Now Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay even a righteous nation?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_5" data-id="GN20_5">Said he not himself unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and the innocency of my hands have I done this. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_6" data-id="GN20_6">And God said unto him in the dream, Yea, I know that in the integrity of thy heart thou has done this, and I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_7" data-id="GN20_7">Now therefore restore the man’s wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.</span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_8" data-id="GN20_8">And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_9" data-id="GN20_9">Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and wherein have I sinned against thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_10" data-id="GN20_10">And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_11" data-id="GN20_11">And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife’s sake. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_12" data-id="GN20_12">And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife: </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_13" data-id="GN20_13">and it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me: at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_14" data-id="GN20_14">And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and men-servants and women-servants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_15" data-id="GN20_15">And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_16" data-id="GN20_16">And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, it is for thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee; and in respect of all thou art righted.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_17" data-id="GN20_17">And Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants; and they bare children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN20_18" data-id="GN20_18">For Jehovah had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.</span>
