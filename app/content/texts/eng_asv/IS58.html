<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_1" data-id="IS58_1">Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and declare unto my people their transgression, and to the house of Jacob their sins. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_2" data-id="IS58_2">Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways: as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God, they ask of me righteous judgments; they delight to draw near unto God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_3" data-id="IS58_3">Wherefore have we fasted, <span class="add">say they</span>, and thou seest not? <span class="add">wherefore</span> have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find <span class="add">your own</span> pleasure, and exact all your labors. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_4" data-id="IS58_4">Behold, ye fast for strife and contention, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye fast not this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_5" data-id="IS58_5">Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to Jehovah?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_6" data-id="IS58_6">Is not this the fast that I have chosen: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_7" data-id="IS58_7">Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_8" data-id="IS58_8">Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy healing shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of Jehovah shall by thy rearward. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_9" data-id="IS58_9">Then shalt thou call, and Jehovah will answer; thou shalt cry, and he will say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking wickedly;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_10" data-id="IS58_10">and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul: then shall thy light rise in darkness, and thine obscurity be as the noonday; </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_11" data-id="IS58_11">and Jehovah will guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in dry places, and make strong thy bones; and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_12" data-id="IS58_12">And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places; thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_13" data-id="IS58_13">If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, <span class="add">and</span> the holy of Jehovah honorable; and shalt honor it, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking <span class="add">thine own</span> words: </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS58_14" data-id="IS58_14">then shalt thou delight thyself in Jehovah; and I will make thee to ride upon the high places of the earth; and I will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.</span>
