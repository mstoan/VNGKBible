<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_1" data-id="JR9_1">Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people! </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_2" data-id="JR9_2">Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging-place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_3" data-id="JR9_3">And they bend their tongue, <span class="add">as it were</span> their bow, for falsehood; and they are grown strong in the land, but not for truth: for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_4" data-id="JR9_4">Take ye heed every one of his neighbor, and trust ye not in any brother; for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbor will go about with slanders. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_5" data-id="JR9_5">And they will deceive every one his neighbor, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies; they weary themselves to commit iniquity. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_6" data-id="JR9_6">Thy habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_7" data-id="JR9_7">Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how <span class="add">else</span> should I do, because of the daughter of my people?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_8" data-id="JR9_8">Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaketh deceit: one speaketh peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in his heart he layeth wait for him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_9" data-id="JR9_9">Shall I not visit them for these things? saith Jehovah; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_10" data-id="JR9_10">For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the pastures of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none passeth through; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the birds of the heavens and the beasts are fled, they are gone. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_11" data-id="JR9_11">And I will make Jerusalem heaps, a dwelling-place of jackals; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_12" data-id="JR9_12">Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and <span class="add">who is </span> he to whom the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken, that he may declare it? wherefore is the land perished and burned up like a wilderness, so that none passeth through? </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_13" data-id="JR9_13">And Jehovah saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein, </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_14" data-id="JR9_14">but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart, and after the Baalim, which their fathers taught them;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_15" data-id="JR9_15">therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_16" data-id="JR9_16">I will scatter them also among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_17" data-id="JR9_17">Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for the skilful women, that they may come: </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_18" data-id="JR9_18">and let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_19" data-id="JR9_19">For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we ruined! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because they have cast down our dwellings. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_20" data-id="JR9_20">Yet hear the word of Jehovah, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth; and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbor lamentation. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_21" data-id="JR9_21">For death is come up into our windows, it is entered into our palaces; to cut off the children from without, <span class="add">and</span> the young men from the streets. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_22" data-id="JR9_22">Speak, Thus saith Jehovah, The dead bodies of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman; and none shall gather <span class="add">them</span>. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_23" data-id="JR9_23">Thus saith Jehovah, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches; </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_24" data-id="JR9_24">but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he hath understanding, and knoweth me, that I am Jehovah who exerciseth lovingkindness, justice, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_25" data-id="JR9_25">Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will punish all them that are circumcised in <span class="add">their</span> uncircumcision: </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR9_26" data-id="JR9_26">Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that have the corners <span class="add">of their hair</span> cut off, that dwell in the wilderness; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart. </span>
