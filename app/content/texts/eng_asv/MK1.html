<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_4" data-id="MK1_4">John came, who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_5" data-id="MK1_5">And there went out unto him all the country of Judæa, and all they of Jerusalem; and they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_6" data-id="MK1_6">And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and <span class="add">had</span> a leathern girdle about his loins, and did eat locusts and wild honey. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_7" data-id="MK1_7">And he preached, saying, There cometh after me he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_8" data-id="MK1_8">I baptized you in water; but he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_9" data-id="MK1_9">And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in the Jordan.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_10" data-id="MK1_10">And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens rent asunder, and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him: </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_11" data-id="MK1_11">and a voice came out of the heavens, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_12" data-id="MK1_12">And straightway the Spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_13" data-id="MK1_13">And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_14" data-id="MK1_14">Now after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_15" data-id="MK1_15">and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe in the gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_16" data-id="MK1_16">And passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea; for they were fishers. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_17" data-id="MK1_17">And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_18" data-id="MK1_18">And straightway they left the nets, and followed him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_19" data-id="MK1_19">And going on a little further, he saw James the <span class="add">son</span> of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending the nets. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_20" data-id="MK1_20">And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_21" data-id="MK1_21">And they go into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_22" data-id="MK1_22">And they were astonished at his teaching: for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_23" data-id="MK1_23">And straightway there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_24" data-id="MK1_24">saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus thou Nazarene? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_25" data-id="MK1_25">And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_26" data-id="MK1_26">And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_27" data-id="MK1_27">And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? a new teaching! with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_28" data-id="MK1_28">And the report of him went out straightway everywhere into all the region of Galilee round about.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_29" data-id="MK1_29">And straightway, when they were come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_30" data-id="MK1_30">Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever; and straightway they tell him of her:</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_31" data-id="MK1_31">and he came and took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_32" data-id="MK1_32">And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were sick, and them that were possessed with demons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_33" data-id="MK1_33">And all the city was gathered together at the door.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_34" data-id="MK1_34">And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases, and cast out many demons; and he suffered not the demons to speak, because they knew him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_35" data-id="MK1_35">And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_36" data-id="MK1_36">And Simon and they that were with him followed after him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_37" data-id="MK1_37">and they found him, and say unto him, All are seeking thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_38" data-id="MK1_38">And he saith unto them, Let us go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for to this end came I forth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_39" data-id="MK1_39">And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_40" data-id="MK1_40">And there cometh to him a leper, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. </span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_41" data-id="MK1_41">And being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou made clean. </span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_42" data-id="MK1_42">And straightway the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_43" data-id="MK1_43">And he strictly charged him, and straightway sent him out,</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_44" data-id="MK1_44">and saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_45" data-id="MK1_45">But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</span>
