<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_2" data-id="JG15_2">And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_3" data-id="JG15_3">And Samson said unto them, This time shall I be blameless in regard of the Philistines, when I do them a mischief.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_4" data-id="JG15_4">And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between every two tails. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_5" data-id="JG15_5">And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and the standing grain, and also the oliveyards. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_6" data-id="JG15_6">Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they said, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he hath taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_7" data-id="JG15_7">And Samson said unto them, If ye do after this manner, surely I will be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_8" data-id="JG15_8">And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of Etam.</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_9" data-id="JG15_9">Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_10" data-id="JG15_10">And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they said, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_11" data-id="JG15_11">Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what then is this that thou hast done unto us?

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_12" data-id="JG15_12">And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG15_13" data-id="JG15_13">And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.</span>

<div class="q">
<span class="v JG15_16" data-id="JG15_16">With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps,</span>

<div class="q">
<span class="v JG15_16" data-id="JG15_16">With the jawbone of an ass have I smitten a thousand men.</span>
