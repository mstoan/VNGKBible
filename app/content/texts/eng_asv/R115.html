<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v R115_13" data-id="R115_13">For because ye <span class="add">bare it</span> not at the first, Jehovah our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not according to the ordinance. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v R115_14" data-id="R115_14">So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Jehovah, the God of Israel.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v R115_25" data-id="R115_25">So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the house of Obed-edom with joy. </span>

<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v R115_27" data-id="R115_27">And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song <span class="add">with</span> the singers: and David had upon him an ephod of linen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v R115_28" data-id="R115_28">Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with psalteries and harps.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v R115_29" data-id="R115_29">And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart.</span>
