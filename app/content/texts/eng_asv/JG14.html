<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_4" data-id="JG14_4">But his father and his mother knew not that it was of Jehovah; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel. </span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG14_17" data-id="JG14_17">And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she pressed him sore; and she told the riddle to the children of her people.</span>
