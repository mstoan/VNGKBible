<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_2" data-id="DT11_2">And know ye this day: for <span class="add">I speak</span> not with your children that have not known, and that have not seen the chastisement of Jehovah your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his outstretched arm,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_3" data-id="DT11_3">and his signs, and his works, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_4" data-id="DT11_4">and what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how Jehovah hath destroyed them unto this day;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_5" data-id="DT11_5">and what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came unto this place;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_6" data-id="DT11_6">and what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel: </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_7" data-id="DT11_7">but your eyes have seen all the great work of Jehovah which he did.</span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_10" data-id="DT11_10">For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_11" data-id="DT11_11">but the land, whither ye go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, <span class="add">and</span> drinketh water of the rain of heaven, </span>

<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_19" data-id="DT11_19">And ye shall teach them your children, talking of them, when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_20" data-id="DT11_20">And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_21" data-id="DT11_21">that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which Jehovah sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_22" data-id="DT11_22">For if ye shall diligently keep all this commandment which I command you, to do it, to love Jehovah your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him; </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_23" data-id="DT11_23">then will Jehovah drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_24" data-id="DT11_24">Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the hinder sea shall be your border.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_25" data-id="DT11_25">There shall no man be able to stand before you: Jehovah your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath spoken unto you. </span>

<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_26" data-id="DT11_26">Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse:</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_27" data-id="DT11_27">the blessing, if ye shall hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah your God, which I command you this day;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_28" data-id="DT11_28">and the curse, if ye shall not hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_29" data-id="DT11_29">And it shall come to pass, when Jehovah thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt set the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_30" data-id="DT11_30">Are they not beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites that dwell in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh? </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_31" data-id="DT11_31">For ye are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein. </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT11_32" data-id="DT11_32">And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you this day.</span>
