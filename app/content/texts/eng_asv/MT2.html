<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_3" data-id="MT2_3">And when Herod the king heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_4" data-id="MT2_4">And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ should be born. </span>
