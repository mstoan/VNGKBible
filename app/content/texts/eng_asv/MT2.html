<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_1" data-id="MT2_1">Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judæa in the days of Herod the king, behold, Wise-men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_2" data-id="MT2_2">Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we saw his star in the east, and are come to worship him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_3" data-id="MT2_3">And when Herod the king heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_4" data-id="MT2_4">And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ should be born. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_5" data-id="MT2_5">And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judæa: for thus it is written through the prophet,</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_7" data-id="MT2_7">Then Herod privily called the Wise-men, and learned of them exactly what time the star appeared.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_8" data-id="MT2_8">And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search out exactly concerning the young child; and when ye have found <span class="add">him,</span> bring me word, that I also may come and worship him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_9" data-id="MT2_9">And they, having heard the king, went their way; and lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_10" data-id="MT2_10">And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_11" data-id="MT2_11">And they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary his mother; and they fell down and worshipped him; and opening their treasures they offered unto him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_12" data-id="MT2_12">And being warned <span class="add">of God</span> in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_13" data-id="MT2_13">Now when they were departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I tell thee: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT2_14" data-id="MT2_14">And he arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt;</span>

<span class="v MT2_18" data-id="MT2_18">And she would not be comforted, because they are not.</span>
