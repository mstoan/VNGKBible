<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_1" data-id="HS8_1"> <span class="add">Set</span> the trumpet to thy mouth. As an eagle <span class="add">he cometh </span> against the house of Jehovah, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_2" data-id="HS8_2">They shall cry unto me, My God, we Israel know thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_3" data-id="HS8_3">Israel hath cast off that which is good: the enemy shall pursue him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_4" data-id="HS8_4">They have set up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_5" data-id="HS8_5">He hath cast off thy calf, O Samaria; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency? </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_6" data-id="HS8_6">For from Israel is even this; the workman made it, and it is no God; yea, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_7" data-id="HS8_7">For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: he hath no standing grain; the blade shall yield no meal; if so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_8" data-id="HS8_8">Israel is swallowed up: now are they among the nations as a vessel wherein none delighteth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_9" data-id="HS8_9">For they are gone up to Assyria, <span class="add">like</span> a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_10" data-id="HS8_10">Yea, though they hire among the nations, now will I gather them; and they begin to be diminished by reason of the burden of the king of princes. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_11" data-id="HS8_11">Because Ephraim hath multiplied altars for sinning, altars have been unto him for sinning.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_12" data-id="HS8_12">I wrote for him the ten thousand things of my law; but they are counted as a strange thing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_13" data-id="HS8_13">As for the sacrifices of mine offerings, they sacrifice flesh and eat it; but Jehovah accepteth them not: now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins; they shall return to Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS8_14" data-id="HS8_14">For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and builded palaces; and Judah hath multiplied fortified cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the castles thereof. </span>
