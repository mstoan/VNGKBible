<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_1" data-id="T24_1">I charge <span class="add">thee</span> in the sight of God, and of Christ Jesus, who shall judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_2" data-id="T24_2">preach the word; be urgent in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_3" data-id="T24_3">For the time will come when they will not endure the sound doctrine; but, having itching ears, will heap to themselves teachers after their own lusts; 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_4" data-id="T24_4">and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside unto fables.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_5" data-id="T24_5">But be thou sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_6" data-id="T24_6">For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure is come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_7" data-id="T24_7">I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_8" data-id="T24_8">henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give to me at that day; and not to me only, but also to all them that have loved his appearing.
</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_9" data-id="T24_9">Give diligence to come shortly unto me:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_10" data-id="T24_10">for Demas forsook me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_11" data-id="T24_11">Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee; for he is useful to me for ministering.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_12" data-id="T24_12">But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_13" data-id="T24_13">The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, bring when thou comest, and the books, especially the parchments.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_14" data-id="T24_14">Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord will render to him according to his works:</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_15" data-id="T24_15">of whom do thou also beware; for he greatly withstood our words.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_16" data-id="T24_16">At my first defence no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their account.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_17" data-id="T24_17">But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_18" data-id="T24_18">The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom <span class="add">be</span> the glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_19" data-id="T24_19">Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_20" data-id="T24_20">Erastus remained at Corinth: but Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_21" data-id="T24_21">Give diligence to come before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_22" data-id="T24_22">The Lord be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.</span>
