<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_1" data-id="EC3_1">For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_2" data-id="EC3_2">a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_3" data-id="EC3_3">a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_4" data-id="EC3_4">a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_5" data-id="EC3_5">a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_6" data-id="EC3_6">a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_9" data-id="EC3_9">What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboreth?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_10" data-id="EC3_10">I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_11" data-id="EC3_11">He hath made everything beautiful in its time: also he hath set eternity in their heart, yet so that man cannot find out the work that God hath done from the beginning even to the end. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_12" data-id="EC3_12">I know that there is nothing better for them, than to rejoice, and to do good so long as they live.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_13" data-id="EC3_13">And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labor, is the gift of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_14" data-id="EC3_14">I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it; and God hath done it, that men should fear before him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_15" data-id="EC3_15">That which is hath been long ago; and that which is to be hath long ago been: and God seeketh again that which is passed away. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_16" data-id="EC3_16">And moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_17" data-id="EC3_17">I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_18" data-id="EC3_18">I said in my heart, <span class="add">It is</span> because of the sons of men, that God may prove them, and that they may see that they themselves are <span class="add">but as </span> beasts. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_19" data-id="EC3_19">For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; and man hath no preeminence above the beasts: for all is vanity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_20" data-id="EC3_20">All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</span>
