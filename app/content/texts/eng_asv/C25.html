<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_1" data-id="C25_1">For we know that if the earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_2" data-id="C25_2">For verily in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our habitation which is from heaven:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_3" data-id="C25_3">if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_4" data-id="C25_4">For indeed we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened; not for that we would be unclothed, but that we would be clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up of life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_5" data-id="C25_5">Now he that wrought us for this very thing is God, who gave unto us the earnest of the Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_6" data-id="C25_6">Being therefore always of good courage, and knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_7" data-id="C25_7">(for we walk by faith, not by sight);</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_8" data-id="C25_8">we are of good courage, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_9" data-id="C25_9">Wherefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well-pleasing unto him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_10" data-id="C25_10">For we must all be made manifest before the judgment-seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things <span class="add">done</span> in the body, according to what he hath done, whether <span class="add">it be</span> good or bad. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_11" data-id="C25_11">Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest unto God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_12" data-id="C25_12">We are not again commending ourselves unto you, but <span class="add">speak </span> as giving you occasion of glorying on our behalf, that ye may have wherewith to answer them that glory in appearance, and not in heart. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_13" data-id="C25_13">For whether we are beside ourselves, it is unto God; or whether we are of sober mind, it is unto you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_14" data-id="C25_14">For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that one died for all, therefore all died;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_15" data-id="C25_15">and he died for all, that they that live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto him who for their sakes died and rose again. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_16" data-id="C25_16">Wherefore we henceforth know no man after the flesh: even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know <span class="add">him so</span> no more. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_17" data-id="C25_17">Wherefore if any man is in Christ, <span class="add">he is</span> a new creature: the old things are passed away; behold, they are become new. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_18" data-id="C25_18">But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_19" data-id="C25_19">to wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not reckoning unto them their trespasses, and having committed unto us the word of reconciliation. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_20" data-id="C25_20">We are ambassadors therefore on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us: we beseech <span class="add">you</span> on behalf of Christ, be ye reconciled to God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C25_21" data-id="C25_21">Him who knew no sin he made <span class="add">to be</span> sin on our behalf; that we might become the righteousness of God in him.</span>
