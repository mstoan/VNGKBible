<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_2" data-id="AC2_2">And suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_3" data-id="AC2_3">And there appeared unto them tongues parting asunder, like as of fire; and it sat upon each one of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_4" data-id="AC2_4">And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_5" data-id="AC2_5">Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_6" data-id="AC2_6">And when this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speaking in his own language. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_7" data-id="AC2_7">And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying, Behold, are not all these that speak Galilæans?</span>

<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_23" data-id="AC2_23">him, being delivered up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye by the hand of lawless men did crucify and slay: </span>

<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_30" data-id="AC2_30">Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins he would set <span class="add">one</span> upon his throne; </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_31" data-id="AC2_31">he foreseeing <span class="add">this</span> spake of the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he left unto Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. </span>

<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_34" data-id="AC2_34">For David ascended not into the heavens: but he saith himself,</span>

<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_38" data-id="AC2_38">And Peter <span class="add">said</span> unto them, Repent ye, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ unto the remission of your sins; and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_39" data-id="AC2_39">For to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, <span class="add">even</span> as many as the Lord our God shall call unto him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_40" data-id="AC2_40">And with many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, Save yourselves from this crooked generation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_41" data-id="AC2_41">They then that received his word were baptized: and there were added <span class="add">unto them</span> in that day about three thousand souls. </span>

<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_43" data-id="AC2_43">And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_44" data-id="AC2_44">And all that believed were together, and had all things common;</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_45" data-id="AC2_45">and they sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all, according as any man had need.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_46" data-id="AC2_46">And day by day, continuing stedfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart, </span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_47" data-id="AC2_47">praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to them day by day those that were saved.</span>
