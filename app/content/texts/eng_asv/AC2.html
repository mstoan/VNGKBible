<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_3" data-id="AC2_3">And there appeared unto them tongues parting asunder, like as of fire; and it sat upon each one of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_4" data-id="AC2_4">And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC2_5" data-id="AC2_5">Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven.</span>
