<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT17_2" data-id="MT17_2">and he was transfigured before them; and his face did shine as the sun, and his garments became white as the light.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT17_3" data-id="MT17_3">And behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talking with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT17_4" data-id="MT17_4">And Peter answered, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, I will make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT17_10" data-id="MT17_10">And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elijah must first come?</span>
