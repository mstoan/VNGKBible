<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC3_1" data-id="ZC3_1">And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Jehovah, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC3_2" data-id="ZC3_2">And Jehovah said unto Satan, Jehovah rebuke thee, O Satan; yea, Jehovah that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire? </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC3_3" data-id="ZC3_3">Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC3_4" data-id="ZC3_4">And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take the filthy garments from off him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with rich apparel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC3_5" data-id="ZC3_5">And I said, Let them set a clean mitre upon his head. So they set a clean mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments; and the angel of Jehovah was standing by. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC3_6" data-id="ZC3_6">And the angel of Jehovah protested unto Joshua, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC3_7" data-id="ZC3_7">Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou also shalt judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee a place of access among these that stand by.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC3_8" data-id="ZC3_8">Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows that sit before thee; for they are men that are a sign: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC3_9" data-id="ZC3_9">For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; upon one stone are seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC3_10" data-id="ZC3_10">In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, shall ye invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig-tree.</span>
