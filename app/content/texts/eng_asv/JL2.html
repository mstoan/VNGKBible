<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_1" data-id="JL2_1">Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of Jehovah cometh, for it is nigh at hand; </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_2" data-id="JL2_2">a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as the dawn spread upon the mountains; a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after them, even to the years of many generations. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_3" data-id="JL2_3">A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and none hath escaped them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_4" data-id="JL2_4">The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so do they run.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_5" data-id="JL2_5">Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_6" data-id="JL2_6">At their presence the peoples are in anguish; all faces are waxed pale.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_7" data-id="JL2_7">They run like mighty men; they climb the wall like men of war; and they march every one on his ways, and they break not their ranks. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_8" data-id="JL2_8">Neither doth one thrust another; they march every one in his path; and they burst through the weapons, and break not off <span class="add">their course</span>. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_9" data-id="JL2_9">They leap upon the city; they run upon the wall; they climb up into the houses; they enter in at the windows like a thief.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_10" data-id="JL2_10">The earth quaketh before them; the heavens tremble; the sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_11" data-id="JL2_11">And Jehovah uttereth his voice before his army; for his camp is very great; for he is strong that executeth his word; for the day of Jehovah is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_12" data-id="JL2_12">Yet even now, saith Jehovah, turn ye unto me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_13" data-id="JL2_13">and rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto Jehovah your God; for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and repenteth him of the evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_14" data-id="JL2_14">Who knoweth whether he will not turn and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, even a meal-offering and a drink-offering unto Jehovah your God? </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_15" data-id="JL2_15">Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_16" data-id="JL2_16">gather the people, sanctify the assembly, assemble the old men, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts; let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_17" data-id="JL2_17">Let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Jehovah, and give not thy heritage to reproach, that the nations should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the peoples, Where is their God? </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_18" data-id="JL2_18">Then was Jehovah jealous for his land, and had pity on his people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_19" data-id="JL2_19">And Jehovah answered and said unto his people, Behold, I will send you grain, and new wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_20" data-id="JL2_20">but I will remove far off from you the northern <span class="add">army</span>, and will drive it into a land barren and desolate, its forepart into the eastern sea, and its hinder part into the western sea; and its stench shall come up, and its ill savor shall come up, because it hath done great things. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_21" data-id="JL2_21">Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice; for Jehovah hath done great things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_22" data-id="JL2_22">Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth its fruit, the fig-tree and the vine do yield their strength. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_23" data-id="JL2_23">Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in Jehovah your God; for he giveth you the former rain in just measure, and he causeth to come down for you the rain, the former rain and the latter rain, in the first <span class="add">month</span>. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_24" data-id="JL2_24">And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_25" data-id="JL2_25">And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the canker-worm, and the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm, my great army which I sent among you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_26" data-id="JL2_26">And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and shall praise the name of Jehovah your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you; and my people shall never be put to shame. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_27" data-id="JL2_27">And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am Jehovah your God, and there is none else; and my people shall never be put to shame. </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_28" data-id="JL2_28">And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_29" data-id="JL2_29">and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_30" data-id="JL2_30">And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth: blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_31" data-id="JL2_31">The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of Jehovah cometh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JL2_32" data-id="JL2_32">And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of Jehovah shall be delivered; for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those that escape, as Jehovah hath said, and among the remnant those whom Jehovah doth call.</span>
