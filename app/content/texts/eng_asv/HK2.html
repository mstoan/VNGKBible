<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_6" data-id="HK2_6">Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and that ladeth himself with pledges!</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_7" data-id="HK2_7">Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booty unto them? </span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_16" data-id="HK2_16">Thou art filled with shame, and not glory: drink thou also, and be as one uncircumcised; the cup of Jehovah’s right hand shall come round unto thee, and foul shame shall be upon thy glory.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_17" data-id="HK2_17">For the violence done to Lebanon shall cover thee, and the destruction of the beasts, which made them afraid; because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein.</span>

<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_20" data-id="HK2_20">But Jehovah is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.</span>
