<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_4" data-id="HK2_4">Behold, his soul is puffed up, it is not upright in him; but the righteous shall live by his faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_5" data-id="HK2_5">Yea, moreover, wine is treacherous, a haughty man, that keepeth not at home; who enlargeth his desire as Sheol, and he is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all peoples.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_6" data-id="HK2_6">Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and that ladeth himself with pledges!</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_7" data-id="HK2_7">Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booty unto them? </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_8" data-id="HK2_8">Because thou hast plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples shall plunder thee, because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein.</span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_10" data-id="HK2_10">Thou hast devised shame to thy house, by cutting off many peoples, and hast sinned against thy soul.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_14" data-id="HK2_14">For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_15" data-id="HK2_15">Woe unto him that giveth his neighbor drink, <span class="add">to thee</span> that addest thy venom, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness! </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_16" data-id="HK2_16">Thou art filled with shame, and not glory: drink thou also, and be as one uncircumcised; the cup of Jehovah’s right hand shall come round unto thee, and foul shame shall be upon thy glory.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_17" data-id="HK2_17">For the violence done to Lebanon shall cover thee, and the destruction of the beasts, which made them afraid; because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_18" data-id="HK2_18">What profiteth the graven image, that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, even the teacher of lies, that he that fashioneth its form trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?</span>

<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v HK2_20" data-id="HK2_20">But Jehovah is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.</span>
