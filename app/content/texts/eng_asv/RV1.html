<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_2" data-id="RV1_2">who bare witness of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, <span class="add">even</span> of all things that he saw. </span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_10" data-id="RV1_10">I was in the Spirit on the Lordâ€™s day, and I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_12" data-id="RV1_12">And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And having turned I saw seven golden candlesticks;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_13" data-id="RV1_13">and in the midst of the candlesticks one like unto a son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about at the breasts with a golden girdle. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_14" data-id="RV1_14">And his head and his hair were white as white wool, <span class="add">white </span> as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_15" data-id="RV1_15">and his feet like unto burnished brass, as if it had been refined in a furnace; and his voice as the voice of many waters. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_16" data-id="RV1_16">And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_17" data-id="RV1_17">And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as one dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not; I am the first and the last, </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_18" data-id="RV1_18">and the Living one; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive for evermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_19" data-id="RV1_19">Write therefore the things which thou sawest, and the things which are, and the things which shall come to pass hereafter; </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_20" data-id="RV1_20">the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks are seven churches.</span>
