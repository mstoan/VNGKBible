<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_3" data-id="MT12_3">But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was hungry, and they that were with him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT12_4" data-id="MT12_4">how he entered into the house of God, and ate the showbread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them that were with him, but only for the priests? </span>
