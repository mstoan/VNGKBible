<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_2" data-id="MK15_2">And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering saith unto him, Thou sayest.</span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_8" data-id="MK15_8">And the multitude went up and began to ask him <span class="add">to do</span> as he was wont to do unto them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_9" data-id="MK15_9">And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_10" data-id="MK15_10">For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_11" data-id="MK15_11">But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_12" data-id="MK15_12">And Pilate again answered and said unto them, What then shall I do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_13" data-id="MK15_13">And they cried out again, Crucify him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_14" data-id="MK15_14">And Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, Crucify him.</span>

<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_20" data-id="MK15_20">And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the purple, and put on him his garments. And they lead him out to crucify him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_21" data-id="MK15_21">And they compel one passing by, Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go <span class="add">with them</span>, that he might bear his cross. </span>

<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_39" data-id="MK15_39">And when the centurion, who stood by over against him, saw that he so gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_40" data-id="MK15_40">And there were also women beholding from afar: among whom <span class="add">were </span> both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</span>
