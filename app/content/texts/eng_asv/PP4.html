<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_1" data-id="PP4_1">Wherefore, my brethren beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my beloved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_2" data-id="PP4_2">I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_3" data-id="PP4_3">Yea, I beseech thee also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_4" data-id="PP4_4">Rejoice in the Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_5" data-id="PP4_5">Let your forbearance be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_6" data-id="PP4_6">In nothing be anxious; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_7" data-id="PP4_7">And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_8" data-id="PP4_8">Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honorable, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_9" data-id="PP4_9">The things which ye both learned and received and heard and saw in me, these things do: and the God of peace shall be with you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_10" data-id="PP4_10">But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length ye have revived your thought for me; wherein ye did indeed take thought, but ye lacked opportunity. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_11" data-id="PP4_11">Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therein to be content.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_12" data-id="PP4_12">I know how to be abased, and I know also how to abound: in everything and in all things have I learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_13" data-id="PP4_13">I can do all things in him that strengtheneth me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_14" data-id="PP4_14">Howbeit ye did well that ye had fellowship with my affliction.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_15" data-id="PP4_15">And ye yourselves also know, ye Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and receiving but ye only;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_16" data-id="PP4_16">for even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my need.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_17" data-id="PP4_17">Not that I seek for the gift; but I seek for the fruit that increaseth to your account.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_18" data-id="PP4_18">But I have all things, and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things <span class="add">that came</span> from you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_19" data-id="PP4_19">And my God shall supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_20" data-id="PP4_20">Now unto our God and Father <span class="add">be</span> the glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_21" data-id="PP4_21">Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren that are with me salute you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_22" data-id="PP4_22">All the saints salute you, especially they that are of Cæsar’s household.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP4_23" data-id="PP4_23">The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</span>
