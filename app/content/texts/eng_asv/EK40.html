<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_1" data-id="EK40_1">In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth <span class="add">day</span> of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day, the hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me thither. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_2" data-id="EK40_2">In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mountain, whereon was as it were the frame of a city on the south. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_3" data-id="EK40_3">And he brought me thither; and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_4" data-id="EK40_4">And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee; for, to the intent that I may show them unto thee, art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_5" data-id="EK40_5">And, behold, a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the manâ€™s hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a handbreadth each: so he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_6" data-id="EK40_6">Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the steps thereof: and he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed broad; and the other threshold, one reed broad.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_7" data-id="EK40_7">And every lodge was one reed long, and one reed broad; and <span class="add">the space</span> between the lodges was five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_8" data-id="EK40_8">He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_9" data-id="EK40_9">Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the house. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_10" data-id="EK40_10">And the lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_11" data-id="EK40_11">And he measured the breadth of the opening of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_12" data-id="EK40_12">and a border before the lodges, one cubit <span class="add">on this side</span>, and a border, one cubit on that side; and the lodges, six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_13" data-id="EK40_13">And he measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other, a breadth of five and twenty cubits; door against door. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_14" data-id="EK40_14">He made also posts, threescore cubits; and the court <span class="add">reached </span> unto the posts, round about the gate. </span>

<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_23" data-id="EK40_23">And there was a gate to the inner court over against the <span class="add">other </span> gate, <span class="add">both</span> on the north and on the east; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_24" data-id="EK40_24">And he led me toward the south; and, behold, a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_25" data-id="EK40_25">And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_26" data-id="EK40_26">And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them; and it had palm-trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof. </span>
