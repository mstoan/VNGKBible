<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_1" data-id="HS5_1">Hear this, O ye priests, and hearken, O house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king; for unto you pertaineth the judgment; for ye have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_2" data-id="HS5_2">And the revolters are gone deep in making slaughter; but I am a rebuker of them all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_3" data-id="HS5_3">I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me; for now, O Ephraim, thou hast played the harlot, Israel is defiled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_4" data-id="HS5_4">Their doings will not suffer them to turn unto their God; for the spirit of whoredom is within them, and they know not Jehovah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_5" data-id="HS5_5">And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity; Judah also shall stumble with them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_6" data-id="HS5_6">They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah; but they shall not find him: he hath withdrawn himself from them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_7" data-id="HS5_7">They have dealt treacherously against Jehovah; for they have borne strange children: now shall the new moon devour them with their fields. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_8" data-id="HS5_8">Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: sound an alarm at Beth-aven; behind thee, O Benjamin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_9" data-id="HS5_9">Ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_10" data-id="HS5_10">The princes of Judah are like them that remove the landmark: I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_11" data-id="HS5_11">Ephraim is oppressed, he is crushed in judgment; because he was content to walk after <span class="add">man’s</span> command. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_12" data-id="HS5_12">Therefore am I unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_13" data-id="HS5_13">When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah <span class="add">saw</span> his wound, then went Ephraim to Assyria, and sent to king Jareb: but he is not able to heal you, neither will he cure you of your wound.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_14" data-id="HS5_14">For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will carry off, and there shall be none to deliver. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS5_15" data-id="HS5_15">I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me earnestly. </span>
