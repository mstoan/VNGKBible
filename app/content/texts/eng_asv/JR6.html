<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_1" data-id="JR6_1">Flee for safety, ye children of Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise up a signal on Beth-haccherem; for evil looketh forth from the north, and a great destruction.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_2" data-id="JR6_2">The comely and delicate one, the daughter of Zion, will I cut off.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_3" data-id="JR6_3">Shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_4" data-id="JR6_4">Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day declineth, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_5" data-id="JR6_5">Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_6" data-id="JR6_6">For thus hath Jehovah of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_7" data-id="JR6_7">As a well casteth forth its waters, so she casteth forth her wickedness: violence and destruction is heard in her; before me continually is sickness and wounds. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_8" data-id="JR6_8">Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from thee; lest I make thee a desolation, a land not inhabited.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_9" data-id="JR6_9">Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn again thy hand as a grape-gatherer into the baskets. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_10" data-id="JR6_10">To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of Jehovah is become unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_11" data-id="JR6_11">Therefore I am full of the wrath of Jehovah; I am weary with holding in: pour it out upon the children in the street, and upon the assembly of young men together; for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_12" data-id="JR6_12">And their houses shall be turned unto others, their fields and their wives together; for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_13" data-id="JR6_13">For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_14" data-id="JR6_14">They have healed also the hurt of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_15" data-id="JR6_15">Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall; at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith Jehovah.</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_17" data-id="JR6_17">And I set watchmen over you, <span class="add">saying</span>, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet; but they said, We will not hearken.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_18" data-id="JR6_18">Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_19" data-id="JR6_19">Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_20" data-id="JR6_20">To what purpose cometh there to me frankincense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt-offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing unto me. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_21" data-id="JR6_21">Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will lay stumbling-blocks before this people; and the fathers and the sons together shall stumble against them; the neighbor and his friend shall perish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_22" data-id="JR6_22">Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, a people cometh from the north country; and a great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_23" data-id="JR6_23">They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea, and they ride upon horses, every one set in array, as a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Zion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_24" data-id="JR6_24">We have heard the report thereof; our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, <span class="add">and</span> pangs as of a woman in travail. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_25" data-id="JR6_25">Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy, <span class="add">and</span> terror, are on every side. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_26" data-id="JR6_26">O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_27" data-id="JR6_27">I have made thee a trier <span class="add">and</span> a fortress among my people; that thou mayest know and try their way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_28" data-id="JR6_28">They are all grievous revolters, going about with slanders; they are brass and iron: they all of them deal corruptly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_29" data-id="JR6_29">The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire: in vain do they go on refining; for the wicked are not plucked away. </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR6_30" data-id="JR6_30">Refuse silver shall men call them, because Jehovah hath rejected them.</span>
