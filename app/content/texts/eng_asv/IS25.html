<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS25_1" data-id="IS25_1">O Jehovah, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things, <span class="add">even</span> counsels of old, in faithfulness <span class="add">and</span> truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS25_2" data-id="IS25_2">For thou hast made of a city a heap, of a fortified city a ruin, a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS25_3" data-id="IS25_3">Therefore shall a strong people glorify thee; a city of terrible nations shall fear thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS25_4" data-id="IS25_4">For thou hast been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS25_5" data-id="IS25_5">As the heat in a dry place wilt thou bring down the noise of strangers; as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of the terrible ones shall be brought low. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS25_6" data-id="IS25_6">And in this mountain will Jehovah of hosts make unto all peoples a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS25_7" data-id="IS25_7">And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering that covereth all peoples, and the veil that is spread over all nations. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS25_8" data-id="IS25_8">He hath swallowed up death for ever; and the Lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the reproach of his people will he take away from off all the earth: for Jehovah hath spoken it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS25_9" data-id="IS25_9">And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is Jehovah; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS25_10" data-id="IS25_10">For in this mountain will the hand of Jehovah rest; and Moab shall be trodden down in his place, even as straw is trodden down in the water of the dung-hill. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS25_11" data-id="IS25_11">And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst thereof, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth <span class="add">his hands</span> to swim; but <span class="add">Jehovah </span> will lay low his pride together with the craft of his hands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS25_12" data-id="IS25_12">And the high fortress of thy walls hath he brought down, laid low, and brought to the ground, even to the dust.</span>
