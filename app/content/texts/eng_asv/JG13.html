<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_1" data-id="JG13_1">And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah; and Jehovah delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_2" data-id="JG13_2">And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_3" data-id="JG13_3">And the angel of Jehovah appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not; but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_4" data-id="JG13_4">Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_5" data-id="JG13_5">for, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come upon his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_6" data-id="JG13_6">Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of the angel of God, very terrible; and I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_7" data-id="JG13_7">but he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb to the day of his death.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_8" data-id="JG13_8">Then Manoah entreated Jehovah, and said, Oh, Lord, I pray thee, let the man of God whom thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_9" data-id="JG13_9">And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_10" data-id="JG13_10">And the woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the <span class="add">other </span> day. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_11" data-id="JG13_11">And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_12" data-id="JG13_12">And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass: what shall be the ordering of the child, and <span class="add">how</span> shall we do unto him? </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_13" data-id="JG13_13">And the angel of Jehovah said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_14" data-id="JG13_14">She may not eat of anything that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_15" data-id="JG13_15">And Manoah said unto the angel of Jehovah, I pray thee, let us detain thee, that we may make ready a kid for thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_16" data-id="JG13_16">And the angel of Jehovah said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; and if thou wilt make ready a burnt-offering, thou must offer it unto Jehovah. For Manoah knew not that he was the angel of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_17" data-id="JG13_17">And Manoah said unto the angel of Jehovah, What is thy name, that, when thy words come to pass, we may do thee honor?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_18" data-id="JG13_18">And the angel of Jehovah said unto him, Wherefore askest thou after my name, seeing it is wonderful?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_19" data-id="JG13_19">So Manoah took the kid with the meal-offering, and offered it upon the rock unto Jehovah: and <span class="add">the angel</span> did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_20" data-id="JG13_20">For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of Jehovah ascended in the flame of the altar: and Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_21" data-id="JG13_21">But the angel of Jehovah did no more appear to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_22" data-id="JG13_22">And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_23" data-id="JG13_23">But his wife said unto him, If Jehovah were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and a meal-offering at our hand, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things as these. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_24" data-id="JG13_24">And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and Jehovah blessed him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG13_25" data-id="JG13_25">And the Spirit of Jehovah began to move him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.</span>
