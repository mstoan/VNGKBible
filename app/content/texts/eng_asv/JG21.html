 to death. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_6" data-id="JG21_6">And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_9" data-id="JG21_9">For when the people were numbered, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_10" data-id="JG21_10">And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones.

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_13" data-id="JG21_13">And the whole congregation sent and spake to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace unto them.

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_16" data-id="JG21_16">Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin? 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_17" data-id="JG21_17">And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that are escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not blotted out from Israel. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_18" data-id="JG21_18">Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters, for the children of Israel had sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.

<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_19" data-id="JG21_19">And they said, Behold, there is a feast of Jehovah from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.
</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_20" data-id="JG21_20">And they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_21" data-id="JG21_21">and see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_22" data-id="JG21_22">And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come to complain unto us, that we will say unto them, Grant them graciously unto us, because we took not for each man <span class="add">of them</span> his wife in battle, neither did ye give them unto them,
 else would ye now be guilty.
