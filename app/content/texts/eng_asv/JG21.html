<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_6" data-id="JG21_6">And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day. </span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_18" data-id="JG21_18">Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters, for the children of Israel had sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_19" data-id="JG21_19">And they said, Behold, there is a feast of Jehovah from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_20" data-id="JG21_20">And they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_21" data-id="JG21_21">and see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG21_22" data-id="JG21_22">And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come to complain unto us, that we will say unto them, Grant them graciously unto us, because we took not for each man <span class="add">of them</span> his wife in battle, neither did ye give them unto them, else would ye now be guilty. </span>
