<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_2" data-id="NU31_2">Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_3" data-id="NU31_3">And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm ye men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute Jehovah’s vengeance on Midian. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_4" data-id="NU31_4">Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_5" data-id="NU31_5">So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_6" data-id="NU31_6">And Moses sent them, a thousand of every tribe, to the war, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_7" data-id="NU31_7">And they warred against Midian, as Jehovah commanded Moses; and they slew every male.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_8" data-id="NU31_8">And they slew the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain: Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_9" data-id="NU31_9">And the children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones; and all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods, they took for a prey. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_10" data-id="NU31_10">And all their cities in the places wherein they dwelt, and all their encampments, they burnt with fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_11" data-id="NU31_11">And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of man and of beast.</span>
