<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB42_8" data-id="JB42_8">Now therefore, take unto you seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt-offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you; for him will I accept, that I deal not with you after your folly; for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB42_12" data-id="JB42_12">So Jehovah blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: and he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses. </span>
