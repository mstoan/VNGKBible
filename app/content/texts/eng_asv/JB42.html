 hath. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB42_8" data-id="JB42_8">Now therefore, take unto you seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt-offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you; for him will I accept, that I deal not with you after your folly; for ye
 have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB42_11" data-id="JB42_11">Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him concerning all the evil that Jehovah had
 brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one a ring of gold.
</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB42_12" data-id="JB42_12">So Jehovah blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: and he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JB42_13" data-id="JB42_13">He had also seven sons and three daughters.</span>
