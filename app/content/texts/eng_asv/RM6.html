<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_1" data-id="RM6_1">What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_2" data-id="RM6_2">God forbid. We who died to sin, how shall we any longer live therein?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_3" data-id="RM6_3">Or are ye ignorant that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_4" data-id="RM6_4">We were buried therefore with him through baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_5" data-id="RM6_5">For if we have become united with <span class="add">him</span> in the likeness of his death, we shall be also <span class="add">in the likeness</span> of his resurrection; </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_6" data-id="RM6_6">knowing this, that our old man was crucified with <span class="add">him</span>, that the body of sin might be done away, that so we should no longer be in bondage to sin; </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_7" data-id="RM6_7">for he that hath died is justified from sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_8" data-id="RM6_8">But if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_9" data-id="RM6_9">knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death no more hath dominion over him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_10" data-id="RM6_10">For the death that he died, he died unto sin once: but the life that he liveth, he liveth unto God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_11" data-id="RM6_11">Even so reckon ye also yourselves to be dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_12" data-id="RM6_12">Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof:</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_13" data-id="RM6_13">neither present your members unto sin <span class="add">as</span> instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves unto God, as alive from the dead, and your members <span class="add">as</span> instruments of righteousness unto God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_14" data-id="RM6_14">For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under law, but under grace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_15" data-id="RM6_15">What then? shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? God forbid.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_16" data-id="RM6_16">Know ye not, that to whom ye present yourselves <span class="add">as</span> servants unto obedience, his servants ye are whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_17" data-id="RM6_17">But thanks be to God, that, whereas ye were servants of sin, ye became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto ye were delivered; </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_18" data-id="RM6_18">and being made free from sin, ye became servants of righteousness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_19" data-id="RM6_19">I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye presented your members <span class="add">as</span> servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, even so now present your members <span class="add">as</span> servants to righteousness unto sanctification. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_20" data-id="RM6_20">For when ye were servants of sin, ye were free in regard of righteousness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_21" data-id="RM6_21">What fruit then had ye at that time in the things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_22" data-id="RM6_22">But now being made free from sin and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM6_23" data-id="RM6_23">For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span>
