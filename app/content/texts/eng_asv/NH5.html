<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH5_1" data-id="NH5_1">Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH5_2" data-id="NH5_2">For there were that said, We, our sons and our daughters, are many: let us get grain, that we may eat and live.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH5_3" data-id="NH5_3">Some also there were that said, We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses: let us get grain, because of the dearth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH5_4" data-id="NH5_4">There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the kingâ€™s tribute <span class="add">upon</span> our fields and our vineyards. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH5_5" data-id="NH5_5">Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage <span class="add">already</span>: neither is it in our power to help it; for other men have our fields and our vineyards.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH5_6" data-id="NH5_6">And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH5_7" data-id="NH5_7">Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I held a great assembly against them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH5_8" data-id="NH5_8">And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, that were sold unto the nations; and would ye even sell your brethren, and should they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found never a word.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH5_9" data-id="NH5_9">Also I said, The thing that ye do is not good: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies? </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH5_10" data-id="NH5_10">And I likewise, my brethren and my servants, do lend them money and grain. I pray you, let us leave off this usury.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH5_11" data-id="NH5_11">Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH5_12" data-id="NH5_12">Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, even as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH5_13" data-id="NH5_13">Also I shook out my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performeth not this promise; even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the assembly said, Amen, and praised Jehovah. And the people did according to this promise. </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH5_14" data-id="NH5_14">Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, <span class="add">that is</span>, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH5_15" data-id="NH5_15">But the former governors that were before me were chargeable unto the people, and took of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH5_16" data-id="NH5_16">Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH5_17" data-id="NH5_17">Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, a hundred and fifty men, besides those that came unto us from among the nations that were round about us. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH5_18" data-id="NH5_18">Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I demanded not the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH5_19" data-id="NH5_19">Remember unto me, O my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.</span>
