<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_1" data-id="JM2_1">My brethren, hold not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, <span class="add">the Lord </span> of glory, with respect of persons. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_2" data-id="JM2_2">For if there come into your synagogue a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, and there come in also a poor man in vile clothing; </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_3" data-id="JM2_3">and ye have regard to him that weareth the fine clothing, and say, Sit thou here in a good place; and ye say to the poor man, Stand thou there, or sit under my footstool; </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_4" data-id="JM2_4">do ye not make distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_5" data-id="JM2_5">Hearken, my beloved brethren; did not God choose them that are poor as to the world <span class="add">to be</span> rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he promised to them that love him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_6" data-id="JM2_6">But ye have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you, and themselves drag you before the judgment-seats?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_7" data-id="JM2_7">Do not they blaspheme the honorable name by which ye are called?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_8" data-id="JM2_8">Howbeit if ye fulfil the royal law, according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_9" data-id="JM2_9">but if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_10" data-id="JM2_10">For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one <span class="add">point</span>, he is become guilty of all. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_11" data-id="JM2_11">For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou dost not commit adultery, but killest, thou art become a transgressor of the law. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_12" data-id="JM2_12">So speak ye, and so do, as men that are to be judged by a law of liberty.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_13" data-id="JM2_13">For judgment <span class="add">is</span> without mercy to him that hath showed no mercy: mercy glorieth against judgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_14" data-id="JM2_14">What doth it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but have not works? can that faith save him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_15" data-id="JM2_15">If a brother or sister be naked and in lack of daily food,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_16" data-id="JM2_16">and one of you say unto them, Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; and yet ye give them not the things needful to the body; what doth it profit? </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_17" data-id="JM2_17">Even so faith, if it have not works, is dead in itself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_18" data-id="JM2_18">Yea, a man will say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: show me thy faith apart from <span class="add">thy</span> works, and I by my works will show thee <span class="add">my</span> faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_19" data-id="JM2_19">Thou believest that God is one; thou doest well: the demons also believe, and shudder.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_20" data-id="JM2_20">But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith apart from works is barren?</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_21" data-id="JM2_21">Was not Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_22" data-id="JM2_22">Thou seest that faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_23" data-id="JM2_23">and the scripture was fulfilled which saith, And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_24" data-id="JM2_24">Ye see that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_25" data-id="JM2_25">And in like manner was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way? </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM2_26" data-id="JM2_26">For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.</span>
