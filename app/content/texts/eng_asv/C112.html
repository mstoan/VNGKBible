<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_1" data-id="C112_1">Now concerning spiritual <span class="add">gifts</span>, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_2" data-id="C112_2">Ye know that when ye were Gentiles <span class="add">ye were</span> led away unto those dumb idols, howsoever ye might be led.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_3" data-id="C112_3">Wherefore I make known unto you, that no man speaking in the Spirit of God saith, Jesus is anathema; and no man can say, Jesus is Lord, but in the Holy Spirit. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_4" data-id="C112_4">Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_5" data-id="C112_5">And there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_6" data-id="C112_6">And there are diversities of workings, but the same God, who worketh all things in all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_7" data-id="C112_7">But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_8" data-id="C112_8">For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit: </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_9" data-id="C112_9">to another faith, in the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, in the one Spirit;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_10" data-id="C112_10">and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits: to another <span class="add">divers</span> kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_11" data-id="C112_11">but all these worketh the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as he will.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_12" data-id="C112_12">For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_13" data-id="C112_13">For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_14" data-id="C112_14">For the body is not one member, but many.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_15" data-id="C112_15">If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_16" data-id="C112_16">And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_17" data-id="C112_17">If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_18" data-id="C112_18">But now hath God set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_19" data-id="C112_19">And if they were all one member, where were the body?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_20" data-id="C112_20">But now they are many members, but one body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_21" data-id="C112_21">And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_22" data-id="C112_22">Nay, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary:</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_23" data-id="C112_23">and those <span class="add">parts</span> of the body, which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely <span class="add">parts</span> have more abundant comeliness; </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_24" data-id="C112_24">whereas our comely <span class="add">parts</span> have no need: but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to that <span class="add">part</span> which lacked; </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_25" data-id="C112_25">that there should be no schism in the body; but <span class="add">that</span> the members should have the same care one for another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_26" data-id="C112_26">And whether one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it; or <span class="add">one</span> member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_27" data-id="C112_27">Now ye are the body of Christ, and severally members thereof.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_28" data-id="C112_28">And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, <span class="add">divers</span> kinds of tongues.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_29" data-id="C112_29">Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all <span class="add">workers of</span> miracles? </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_30" data-id="C112_30">have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v C112_31" data-id="C112_31">But desire earnestly the greater gifts. And moreover a most excellent way show I unto you.</span>
