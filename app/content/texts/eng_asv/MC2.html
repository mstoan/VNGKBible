<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_1" data-id="MC2_1">Woe to them that devise iniquity and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_2" data-id="MC2_2">And they covet fields, and seize them; and houses, and take them away: and they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_3" data-id="MC2_3">Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks, neither shall ye walk haughtily; for it is an evil time. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_4" data-id="MC2_4">In that day shall they take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, <span class="add">and</span> say, We are utterly ruined: he changeth the portion of my people: how doth he remove <span class="add">it</span> from me! to the rebellious he divideth our fields. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_5" data-id="MC2_5">Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the line by lot in the assembly of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_6" data-id="MC2_6">Prophesy ye not, <span class="add">thus</span> they prophesy. They shall not prophesy to these: reproaches shall not depart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_7" data-id="MC2_7">Shall it be said, O house of Jacob, Is the Spirit of Jehovah straitened? are these his doings? Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly? </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_8" data-id="MC2_8">But of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye strip the robe from off the garment from them that pass by securely <span class="add">as men</span> averse from war. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_9" data-id="MC2_9">The women of my people ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their young children ye take away my glory for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_10" data-id="MC2_10">Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your resting-place; because of uncleanness that destroyeth, even with a grievous destruction. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_11" data-id="MC2_11">If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood do lie, <span class="add">saying</span>, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_12" data-id="MC2_12">I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as a flock in the midst of their pasture; they shall make great noise by reason of <span class="add">the multitude of</span> men. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC2_13" data-id="MC2_13">The breaker is gone up before them: they have broken forth and passed on to the gate, and are gone out thereat; and their king is passed on before them, and Jehovah at the head of them. </span>
