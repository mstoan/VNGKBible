<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_2" data-id="EK15_2">Son of man, what is the vine-tree more than any tree, the vine-branch which is among the trees of the forest?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_3" data-id="EK15_3">Shall wood be taken thereof to make any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_4" data-id="EK15_4">Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire hath devoured both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned: is it profitable for any work? </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_5" data-id="EK15_5">Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned, shall it yet be meet for any work! </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK15_6" data-id="EK15_6">Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As the vine-tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. </span>
