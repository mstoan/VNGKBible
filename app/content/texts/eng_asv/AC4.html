<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_1" data-id="AC4_1">And as they spake unto the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_2" data-id="AC4_2">being sore troubled because they taught the people, and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_3" data-id="AC4_3">And they laid hands on them, and put them in ward unto the morrow: for it was now eventide.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_4" data-id="AC4_4">But many of them that heard the word believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_5" data-id="AC4_5">And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_6" data-id="AC4_6">and Annas the high priest <span class="add">was there</span>, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_7" data-id="AC4_7">And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, By what power, or in what name, have ye done this?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_8" data-id="AC4_8">Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_9" data-id="AC4_9">if we this day are examined concerning a good deed done to an impotent man, by what means this man is made whole;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_10" data-id="AC4_10">be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, <span class="add">even</span> in him doth this man stand here before you whole.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_11" data-id="AC4_11">He is the stone which was set at nought of you the builders, which was made the head of the corner.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_12" data-id="AC4_12">And in none other is there salvation: for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, wherein we must be saved. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_13" data-id="AC4_13">Now when they beheld the boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_14" data-id="AC4_14">And seeing the man that was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_15" data-id="AC4_15">But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_16" data-id="AC4_16">saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been wrought through them, is manifest to all that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_17" data-id="AC4_17">But that it spread no further among the people, let us threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_18" data-id="AC4_18">And they called them, and charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_19" data-id="AC4_19">But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken unto you rather than unto God, judge ye: </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_20" data-id="AC4_20">for we cannot but speak the things which we saw and heard.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_21" data-id="AC4_21">And they, when they had further threatened them, let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people; for all men glorified God for that which was done. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_22" data-id="AC4_22">For the man was more than forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was wrought.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_23" data-id="AC4_23">And being let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said unto them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_24" data-id="AC4_24">And they, when they heard it, lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, O Lord, thou that didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is: </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_25" data-id="AC4_25">who by the Holy Spirit, <span class="add">by</span> the mouth of our father David thy servant, didst say,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC4_25" data-id="AC4_25">Why did the Gentiles rage,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC4_25" data-id="AC4_25">And the peoples imagine vain things?</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_26" data-id="AC4_26">The kings of the earth set themselves in array,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC4_26" data-id="AC4_26">And the rulers were gathered together,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC4_26" data-id="AC4_26">Against the Lord, and against his Anointed:</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_27" data-id="AC4_27">for of a truth in this city against thy holy Servant Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together, </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_28" data-id="AC4_28">to do whatsoever thy hand and thy council foreordained to come to pass.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_29" data-id="AC4_29">And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_30" data-id="AC4_30">while thou stretchest forth thy hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of thy holy Servant Jesus. </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_31" data-id="AC4_31">And when they had prayed, the place was shaken wherein they were gathered together; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spake the word of God with boldness. </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_32" data-id="AC4_32">And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and soul: and not one <span class="add">of them</span> said that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_33" data-id="AC4_33">And with great power gave the apostles their witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all. </span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_34" data-id="AC4_34">For neither was there among them any that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, </span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_35" data-id="AC4_35">and laid them at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made unto each, according as any one had need.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_36" data-id="AC4_36">And Joseph, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of exhortation), a Levite, a man of Cyprus by race, </span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_37" data-id="AC4_37">having a field, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet.</span>
