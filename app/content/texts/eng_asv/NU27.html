<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU27_2" data-id="NU27_2">And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, at the door of the tent of meeting, saying, </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU27_3" data-id="NU27_3">Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not among the company of them that gathered themselves together against Jehovah in the company of Korah: but he died in his own sin; and he had no sons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU27_4" data-id="NU27_4">Why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family, because he had no son? Give unto us a possession among the brethren of our father. </span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU27_8" data-id="NU27_8">And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter. </span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU27_13" data-id="NU27_13">And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered;</span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU27_18" data-id="NU27_18">And Jehovah said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay thy hand upon him;</span>
