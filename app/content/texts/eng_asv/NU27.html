<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU27_8" data-id="NU27_8">And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter. </span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU27_18" data-id="NU27_18">And Jehovah said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay thy hand upon him;</span>
