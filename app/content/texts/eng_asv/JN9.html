<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_1" data-id="JN9_1">And as he passed by, he saw a man blind from his birth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_2" data-id="JN9_2">And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_3" data-id="JN9_3">Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_4" data-id="JN9_4">We must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_5" data-id="JN9_5">When I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_6" data-id="JN9_6">When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed his eyes with the clay,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_7" data-id="JN9_7">and said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent). He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_8" data-id="JN9_8">The neighbors therefore, and they that saw him aforetime, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_9" data-id="JN9_9">Others said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am <span class="add">he</span>. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_10" data-id="JN9_10">They said therefore unto him, How then were thine eyes opened?</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_11" data-id="JN9_11">He answered, The man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went away and washed, and I received sight. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_12" data-id="JN9_12">And they said unto him, Where is he? He saith, I know not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_13" data-id="JN9_13">They bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_14" data-id="JN9_14">Now it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_15" data-id="JN9_15">Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_16" data-id="JN9_16">Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. But others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_17" data-id="JN9_17">They say therefore unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, in that he opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_18" data-id="JN9_18">The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight, </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_19" data-id="JN9_19">and asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_20" data-id="JN9_20">His parents answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_21" data-id="JN9_21">but how he now seeth, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he is of age; he shall speak for himself. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_22" data-id="JN9_22">These things said his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man should confess him <span class="add">to be </span> Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_23" data-id="JN9_23">Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_24" data-id="JN9_24">So they called a second time the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_25" data-id="JN9_25">He therefore answered, Whether he is a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_26" data-id="JN9_26">They said therefore unto him, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_27" data-id="JN9_27">He answered them, I told you even now, and ye did not hear; wherefore would ye hear it again? would ye also become his disciples? </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_28" data-id="JN9_28">And they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_29" data-id="JN9_29">We know that God hath spoken unto Moses: but as for this man, we know not whence he is.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_30" data-id="JN9_30">The man answered and said unto them, Why, herein is the marvel, that ye know not whence he is, and <span class="add">yet</span> he opened mine eyes. </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_31" data-id="JN9_31">We know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_32" data-id="JN9_32">Since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_33" data-id="JN9_33">If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_34" data-id="JN9_34">They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_35" data-id="JN9_35">Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, he said, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_36" data-id="JN9_36">He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_37" data-id="JN9_37">Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and he it is that speaketh with thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_38" data-id="JN9_38">And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_39" data-id="JN9_39">And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world, that they that see not may see; and that they that see may become blind. </span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_40" data-id="JN9_40">Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said unto him, Are we also blind?</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN9_41" data-id="JN9_41">Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye would have no sin: but now ye say, We see: your sin remaineth.</span>
