<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_1" data-id="MK4_1">And again he began to teach by the sea side. And there is gathered unto him a very great multitude, so that he entered into a boat, and sat in the sea; and all the multitude were by the sea on the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_2" data-id="MK4_2">And he taught them many things in parables, and said unto them in his teaching,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_3" data-id="MK4_3">Hearken: Behold, the sower went forth to sow:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_4" data-id="MK4_4">and it came to pass, as he sowed, some <span class="add">seed</span> fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_5" data-id="MK4_5">And other fell on the rocky <span class="add">ground</span>, where it had not much earth; and straightway it sprang up, because it had no deepness of earth: </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_6" data-id="MK4_6">and when the sun was risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_7" data-id="MK4_7">And other fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_8" data-id="MK4_8">And others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing; and brought forth, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_9" data-id="MK4_9">And he said, Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_10" data-id="MK4_10">And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parables.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_11" data-id="MK4_11">And he said unto them, Unto you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all things are done in parables: </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_12" data-id="MK4_12">that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest haply they should turn again, and it should be forgiven them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_13" data-id="MK4_13">And he saith unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how shall ye know all the parables?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_14" data-id="MK4_14">The sower soweth the word.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_15" data-id="MK4_15">And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; and when they have heard, straightway cometh Satan, and taketh away the word which hath been sown in them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_16" data-id="MK4_16">And these in like manner are they that are sown upon the rocky <span class="add">places</span>, who, when they have heard the word, straightway receive it with joy;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_17" data-id="MK4_17">and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway they stumble. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_18" data-id="MK4_18">And others are they that are sown among the thorns; these are they that have heard the word,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_19" data-id="MK4_19">and the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_20" data-id="MK4_20">And those are they that were sown upon the good ground; such as hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_21" data-id="MK4_21">And he said unto them, Is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel, or under the bed, <span class="add">and</span> not to be put on the stand? </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_22" data-id="MK4_22">For there is nothing hid, save that it should be manifested; neither was <span class="add">anything</span> made secret, but that it should come to light.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_23" data-id="MK4_23">If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_24" data-id="MK4_24">And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you; and more shall be given unto you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_25" data-id="MK4_25">For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_26" data-id="MK4_26">And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed upon the earth;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_27" data-id="MK4_27">and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he knoweth not how.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_28" data-id="MK4_28">The earth beareth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_29" data-id="MK4_29">But when the fruit is ripe, straightway he putteth forth the sickle, because the harvest is come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_30" data-id="MK4_30">And he said, How shall we liken the kingdom of God? or in what parable shall we set it forth?</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_31" data-id="MK4_31">It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown upon the earth, though it be less than all the seeds that are upon the earth, </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_32" data-id="MK4_32">yet when it is sown, groweth up, and becometh greater than all the herbs, and putteth out great branches; so that the birds of the heaven can lodge under the shadow thereof. </span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_33" data-id="MK4_33">And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it;</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_34" data-id="MK4_34">and without a parable spake he not unto them: but privately to his own disciples he expounded all things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_35" data-id="MK4_35">And on that day, when even was come, he saith unto them, Let us go over unto the other side.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_36" data-id="MK4_36">And leaving the multitude, they take him with them, even as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_37" data-id="MK4_37">And there ariseth a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, insomuch that the boat was now filling.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_38" data-id="MK4_38">And he himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion: and they awake him, and say unto him, Teacher, carest thou not that we perish? </span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_39" data-id="MK4_39">And he awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. </span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_40" data-id="MK4_40">And he said unto them, Why are ye fearful? have ye not yet faith?</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_41" data-id="MK4_41">And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</span>
