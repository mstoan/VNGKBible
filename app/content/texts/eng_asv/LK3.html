<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_2" data-id="LK3_2">in the highpriesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_3" data-id="LK3_3">And he came into all the region round about the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_4" data-id="LK3_4">as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_5" data-id="LK3_5">Every valley shall be filled, And every mountain and hill shall be brought low; And the crooked shall become straight, And the rough ways smooth; </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_6" data-id="LK3_6">And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_7" data-id="LK3_7">He said therefore to the multitudes that went out to be baptized of him, Ye offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_8" data-id="LK3_8">Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_9" data-id="LK3_9">And even now the axe also lieth at the root of the trees: every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_10" data-id="LK3_10">And the multitudes asked him, saying, What then must we do?</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_11" data-id="LK3_11">And he answered and said unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath food, let him do likewise. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_12" data-id="LK3_12">And there came also publicans to be baptized, and they said unto him, Teacher, what must we do?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_13" data-id="LK3_13">And he said unto them, Extort no more than that which is appointed you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_14" data-id="LK3_14">And soldiers also asked him, saying, And we, what must we do? And he said unto them, Extort from no man by violence, neither accuse <span class="add">any one </span> wrongfully; and be content with your wages.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_15" data-id="LK3_15">And as the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether haply he were the Christ; </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_16" data-id="LK3_16">John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but there cometh he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and <span class="add">in </span> fire: </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK3_17" data-id="LK3_17">whose fan is in his hand, thoroughly to cleanse his threshing-floor, and to gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire. </span>
