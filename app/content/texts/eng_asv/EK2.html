<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK2_1" data-id="EK2_1">And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK2_2" data-id="EK2_2">And the Spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet; and I heard him that spake unto me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK2_3" data-id="EK2_3">And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to nations that are rebellious, which have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me even unto this very day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK2_4" data-id="EK2_4">And the children are impudent and stiffhearted: I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK2_5" data-id="EK2_5">And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK2_6" data-id="EK2_6">And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK2_7" data-id="EK2_7">And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK2_8" data-id="EK2_8">But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK2_9" data-id="EK2_9">And when I looked, behold, a hand was put forth unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;</span>
