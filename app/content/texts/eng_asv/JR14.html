<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_1" data-id="JR14_1">The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_2" data-id="JR14_2">Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish, they sit in black upon the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_3" data-id="JR14_3">And their nobles send their little ones to the waters: they come to the cisterns, and find no water; they return with their vessels empty; they are put to shame and confounded, and cover their heads.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_4" data-id="JR14_4">Because of the ground which is cracked, for that no rain hath been in the land, the plowmen are put to shame, they cover their heads. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_5" data-id="JR14_5">Yea, the hind also in the field calveth, and forsaketh <span class="add">her young</span>, because there is no grass. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_6" data-id="JR14_6">And the wild asses stand on the bare heights, they pant for air like jackals; their eyes fail, because there is no herbage. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_7" data-id="JR14_7">Though our iniquities testify against us, work thou for thy name’s sake, O Jehovah; for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_8" data-id="JR14_8">O thou hope of Israel, the Saviour thereof in the time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a sojourner in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night? </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_9" data-id="JR14_9">Why shouldest thou be as a man affrighted, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet thou, O Jehovah, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_10" data-id="JR14_10">Thus saith Jehovah unto this people, Even so have they loved to wander; they have not refrained their feet: therefore Jehovah doth not accept them; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_11" data-id="JR14_11">And Jehovah said unto me, Pray not for this people for <span class="add">their </span> good. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_12" data-id="JR14_12">When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt-offering and meal-offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_13" data-id="JR14_13">Then said I, Ah, Lord Jehovah! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_14" data-id="JR14_14">Then Jehovah said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name; I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake I unto them: they prophesy unto you a lying vision, and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their own heart. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_15" data-id="JR14_15">Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land: By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_16" data-id="JR14_16">And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them-them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_17" data-id="JR14_17">And thou shalt say this word unto them, Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous wound.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_18" data-id="JR14_18">If I go forth into the field, then, behold, the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then, behold, they that are sick with famine! for both the prophet and the priest go about in the land, and have no knowledge.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_19" data-id="JR14_19">Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul loathed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and, behold, dismay!</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_20" data-id="JR14_20">We acknowledge, O Jehovah, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_21" data-id="JR14_21">Do not abhor <span class="add">us</span>, for thy name’s sake; do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_22" data-id="JR14_22">Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he, O Jehovah our God? therefore we will wait for thee; for thou hast made all these things.</span>
