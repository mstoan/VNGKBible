<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS9_7" data-id="IS9_7">Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS9_8" data-id="IS9_8">The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS9_9" data-id="IS9_9">And all the people shall know, <span class="add">even</span> Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in pride and in stoutness of heart, </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS9_10" data-id="IS9_10">The bricks are fallen, but we will build with hewn stone; the sycomores are cut down, but we will put cedars in their place. </span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS9_12" data-id="IS9_12">the Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS9_13" data-id="IS9_13">Yet the people have not turned unto him that smote them, neither have they sought Jehovah of hosts.</span>
