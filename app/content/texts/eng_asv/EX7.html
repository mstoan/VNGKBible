<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX7_4" data-id="EX7_4">But Pharaoh will not hearken unto you, and I will lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth my hosts, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX7_5" data-id="EX7_5">And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them. </span>
