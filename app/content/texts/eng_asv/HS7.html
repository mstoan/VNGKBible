<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_1" data-id="HS7_1">When I would heal Israel, then is the iniquity of Ephraim uncovered, and the wickedness of Samaria; for they commit falsehood, and the thief entereth in, and the troop of robbers ravageth without.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_2" data-id="HS7_2">And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now have their own doings beset them about; they are before my face. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_3" data-id="HS7_3">They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_4" data-id="HS7_4">They are all adulterers; they are as an oven heated by the baker; he ceaseth to stir <span class="add">the fire</span>, from the kneading of the dough, until it be leavened.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_5" data-id="HS7_5">On the day of our king the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine; he stretched out his hand with scoffers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_6" data-id="HS7_6">For they have made ready their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_7" data-id="HS7_7">They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_8" data-id="HS7_8">Ephraim, he mixeth himself among the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_9" data-id="HS7_9">Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth <span class="add">it</span> not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, and he knoweth <span class="add">it </span> not. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_10" data-id="HS7_10">And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: yet they have not returned unto Jehovah their God, nor sought him, for all this. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_11" data-id="HS7_11">And Ephraim is like a silly dove, without understanding: they call unto Egypt, they go to Assyria.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_12" data-id="HS7_12">When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the birds of the heavens; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_13" data-id="HS7_13">Woe unto them! for they have wandered from me; destruction unto them! for they have trespassed against me: though I would redeem them, yet they have spoken lies against me. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_14" data-id="HS7_14">And they have not cried unto me with their heart, but they howl upon their beds: they assemble themselves for grain and new wine; they rebel against me. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_15" data-id="HS7_15">Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, yet do they devise mischief against me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS7_16" data-id="HS7_16">They return, but not to <span class="add">him that is</span> on high; they are like a deceitful bow; their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.</span>
