<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_1" data-id="C211_1">Would that ye could bear with me in a little foolishness: but indeed ye do bear with me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_2" data-id="C211_2">For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy: for I espoused you to one husband, that I might present you <span class="add">as</span> a pure virgin to Christ. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_3" data-id="C211_3">But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity that is toward Christ. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_4" data-id="C211_4">For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or <span class="add">if</span> ye receive a different spirit, which ye did not receive, or a different gospel, which ye did not accept, ye do well to bear with <span class="add">him</span>. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_5" data-id="C211_5">For I reckon that I am not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_6" data-id="C211_6">But though <span class="add">I be</span> rude in speech, yet <span class="add">am I</span> not in knowledge; nay, in every way have we made <span class="add">this</span> manifest unto you in all things. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_7" data-id="C211_7">Or did I commit a sin in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I preached to you the gospel of God for nought?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_8" data-id="C211_8">I robbed other churches, taking wages <span class="add">of them</span> that I might minister unto you;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_9" data-id="C211_9">and when I was present with you and was in want, I was not a burden on any man; for the brethren, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my want; and in everything I kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and <span class="add">so</span> will I keep <span class="add">myself</span>. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_10" data-id="C211_10">As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this glorying in the regions of Achaia.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_11" data-id="C211_11">Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_12" data-id="C211_12">But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_13" data-id="C211_13">For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, fashioning themselves into apostles of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_14" data-id="C211_14">And no marvel; for even Satan fashioneth himself into an angel of light.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_15" data-id="C211_15">It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also fashion themselves as ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_16" data-id="C211_16">I say again, Let no man think me foolish; but if <span class="add">ye do</span>, yet as foolish receive me, that I also may glory a little. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_17" data-id="C211_17">That which I speak, I speak not after the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of glorying.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_18" data-id="C211_18">Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_19" data-id="C211_19">For ye bear with the foolish gladly, being wise <span class="add">yourselves</span>.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_20" data-id="C211_20">For ye bear with a man, if he bringeth you into bondage, if he devoureth you, if he taketh you <span class="add">captive</span>, if he exalteth himself, if he smiteth you on the face.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_21" data-id="C211_21">I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet whereinsoever any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_22" data-id="C211_22">Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_23" data-id="C211_23">Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as one beside himself) I more; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths oft. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_24" data-id="C211_24">Of the Jews five times received I forty <span class="add">stripes</span> save one.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_25" data-id="C211_25">Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day have I been in the deep;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_26" data-id="C211_26"> <span class="add">in</span> journeyings often, <span class="add">in</span> perils of rivers, <span class="add">in</span> perils of robbers, <span class="add">in</span> perils from <span class="add">my</span> countrymen, <span class="add">in</span> perils from the Gentiles, <span class="add">in</span> perils in the city, <span class="add">in</span> perils in the wilderness, <span class="add">in</span> perils in the sea, <span class="add">in</span> perils among false brethren; </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_27" data-id="C211_27"> <span class="add">in</span> labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_28" data-id="C211_28">Besides those things that are without, there is that which presseth upon me daily, anxiety for all the churches.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_29" data-id="C211_29">Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is caused to stumble, and I burn not?</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_30" data-id="C211_30">If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things that concern my weakness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_31" data-id="C211_31">The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed for evermore knoweth that I lie not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_32" data-id="C211_32">In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes in order to take me:</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v C211_33" data-id="C211_33">and through a window was I let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands.</span>
