<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_5" data-id="R26_5">Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be prince over my people Israel:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R26_6" data-id="R26_6">but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there, and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.</span>
