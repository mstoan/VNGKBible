<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_1" data-id="JM4_1">Whence <span class="add">come</span> wars and whence <span class="add">come</span> fightings among you? <span class="add">come they</span> not hence, <span class="add">even</span> of your pleasures that war in your members?</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_2" data-id="JM4_2">Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and covet, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war; ye have not, because ye ask not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_3" data-id="JM4_3">Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may spend <span class="add">it</span> in your pleasures. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_4" data-id="JM4_4">Ye adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore would be a friend of the world maketh himself an enemy of God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_5" data-id="JM4_5">Or think ye that the scripture speaketh in vain? Doth the spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_6" data-id="JM4_6">But he giveth more grace. Wherefore <span class="add">the scripture</span> saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_7" data-id="JM4_7">Be subject therefore unto God; but resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_8" data-id="JM4_8">Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye doubleminded.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_9" data-id="JM4_9">Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_10" data-id="JM4_10">Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall exalt you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_11" data-id="JM4_11">Speak not one against another, brethren. He that speaketh against a brother, or judgeth his brother, speaketh against the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judgest the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_12" data-id="JM4_12">One <span class="add">only</span> is the lawgiver and judge, <span class="add">even</span> he who is able to save and to destroy: but who art thou that judgest thy neighbor? </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_13" data-id="JM4_13">Come now, ye that say, To-day or to-morrow we will go into this city, and spend a year there, and trade, and get gain:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_14" data-id="JM4_14">whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. What is your life? For ye are a vapor, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_15" data-id="JM4_15">For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall both live, and do this or that.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_16" data-id="JM4_16">But now ye glory in your vauntings: all such glorying is evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM4_17" data-id="JM4_17">To him therefore that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.</span>
