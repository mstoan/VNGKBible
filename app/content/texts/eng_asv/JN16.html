<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_1" data-id="JN16_1">These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be caused to stumble.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_2" data-id="JN16_2">They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you shall think that he offereth service unto God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_3" data-id="JN16_3">And these things will they do, because they have not known the Father, nor me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_4" data-id="JN16_4">But these things have I spoken unto you, that when their hour is come, ye may remember them, how that I told you. And these things I said not unto you from the beginning, because I was with you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_5" data-id="JN16_5">But now I go unto him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_6" data-id="JN16_6">But because I have spoken these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_7" data-id="JN16_7">Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I go, I will send him unto you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_8" data-id="JN16_8">And he, when he is come, will convict the world in respect of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_9" data-id="JN16_9">of sin, because they believe not on me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_10" data-id="JN16_10">of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and ye behold me no more;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_11" data-id="JN16_11">of judgment, because the prince of this world hath been judged.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_12" data-id="JN16_12">I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_13" data-id="JN16_13">Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but what things soever he shall hear, <span class="add">these</span> shall he speak: and he shall declare unto you the things that are to come. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_14" data-id="JN16_14">He shall glorify me: for he shall take of mine, and shall declare <span class="add">it</span> unto you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_15" data-id="JN16_15">All things whatsoever the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he taketh of mine, and shall declare <span class="add">it</span> unto you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_16" data-id="JN16_16">A little while, and ye behold me no more; and again a little while, and ye shall see me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_17" data-id="JN16_17"> <span class="add">Some</span> of his disciples therefore said one to another, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye behold me not; and again a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_18" data-id="JN16_18">They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? We know not what he saith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_19" data-id="JN16_19">Jesus perceived that they were desirous to ask him, and he said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, A little while, and ye behold me not, and again a little while, and ye shall see me?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_20" data-id="JN16_20">Verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_21" data-id="JN16_21">A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but when she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for the joy that a man is born into the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_22" data-id="JN16_22">And ye therefore now have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one taketh away from you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_23" data-id="JN16_23">And in that day ye shall ask me no question. Verily, verily, I say unto you, If ye shall ask anything of the Father, he will give it you in my name. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_24" data-id="JN16_24">Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be made full.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_25" data-id="JN16_25">These things have I spoken unto you in dark sayings: the hour cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in dark sayings, but shall tell you plainly of the Father. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_26" data-id="JN16_26">In that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_27" data-id="JN16_27">for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from the Father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_28" data-id="JN16_28">I came out from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go unto the Father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_29" data-id="JN16_29">His disciples say, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no dark saying.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_30" data-id="JN16_30">Now know we that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_31" data-id="JN16_31">Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_32" data-id="JN16_32">Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and <span class="add">yet</span> I am not alone, because the Father is with me. </span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN16_33" data-id="JN16_33">These things have I spoken unto you, that in me ye may have peace. In the world ye have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world. </span>
