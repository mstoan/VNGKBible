<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_1" data-id="PP2_1">If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassions, </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_2" data-id="PP2_2">make full my joy, that ye be of the same mind, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_3" data-id="PP2_3"> <span class="add">doing</span> nothing through faction or through vainglory, but in lowliness of mind each counting other better than himself; </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_4" data-id="PP2_4">not looking each of you to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_5" data-id="PP2_5">Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_6" data-id="PP2_6">who, existing in the form of God, counted not the being on an equality with God a thing to be grasped,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_7" data-id="PP2_7">but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_8" data-id="PP2_8">and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient <span class="add">even</span> unto death, yea, the death of the cross. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_9" data-id="PP2_9">Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and gave unto him the name which is above every name;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_10" data-id="PP2_10">that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of <span class="add">things </span> in heaven and <span class="add">things</span> on earth and <span class="add">things</span> under the earth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_11" data-id="PP2_11">and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_12" data-id="PP2_12">So then, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_13" data-id="PP2_13">for it is God who worketh in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_14" data-id="PP2_14">Do all things without murmurings and questionings:</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_15" data-id="PP2_15">that ye may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye are seen as lights in the world, </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_16" data-id="PP2_16">holding forth the word of life; that I may have whereof to glory in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain neither labor in vain. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_17" data-id="PP2_17">Yea, and if I am offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all:</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_18" data-id="PP2_18">and in the same manner do ye also joy, and rejoice with me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_19" data-id="PP2_19">But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_20" data-id="PP2_20">For I have no man likeminded, who will care truly for your state.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_21" data-id="PP2_21">For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_22" data-id="PP2_22">But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child <span class="add">serveth</span> a father, <span class="add">so</span> he served with me in furtherance of the gospel. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_23" data-id="PP2_23">Him therefore I hope to send forthwith, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me:</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_24" data-id="PP2_24">but I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come shortly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_25" data-id="PP2_25">But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need; </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_26" data-id="PP2_26">since he longed after you all, and was sore troubled, because ye had heard that he was sick:</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_27" data-id="PP2_27">for indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow. </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_28" data-id="PP2_28">I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_29" data-id="PP2_29">Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy; and hold such in honor:</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_30" data-id="PP2_30">because for the work of Christ he came nigh unto death, hazarding his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me. </span>
