<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_1" data-id="JR30_1">The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_2" data-id="JR30_2">Thus speaketh Jehovah, the God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_3" data-id="JR30_3">For, lo, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will turn again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith Jehovah; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_4" data-id="JR30_4">And these are the words that Jehovah spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_5" data-id="JR30_5">For thus saith Jehovah: We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_6" data-id="JR30_6">Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child: wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness? </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_7" data-id="JR30_7">Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_8" data-id="JR30_8">And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds; and strangers shall no more make him their bondman;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_9" data-id="JR30_9">but they shall serve Jehovah their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_10" data-id="JR30_10">Therefore fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith Jehovah; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_11" data-id="JR30_11">For I am with thee, saith Jehovah, to save thee: for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have scattered thee, but I will not make a full end of thee; but I will correct thee in measure, and will in no wise leave thee unpunished.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_12" data-id="JR30_12">For thus saith Jehovah, Thy hurt is incurable, and thy wound grievous.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_13" data-id="JR30_13">There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_14" data-id="JR30_14">All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not: for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_15" data-id="JR30_15">Why criest thou for thy hurt? thy pain is incurable: for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_16" data-id="JR30_16">Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that despoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_17" data-id="JR30_17">For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith Jehovah; because they have called thee an outcast, <span class="add">saying</span>, It is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_18" data-id="JR30_18">Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will turn again the captivity of Jacob’s tents, and have compassion on his dwelling-places; and the city shall be builded upon its own hill, and the palace shall be inhabited after its own manner.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_19" data-id="JR30_19">And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_20" data-id="JR30_20">Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me; and I will punish all that oppress them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_21" data-id="JR30_21">And their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is he that hath had boldness to approach unto me? saith Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_22" data-id="JR30_22">And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_23" data-id="JR30_23">Behold, the tempest of Jehovah, <span class="add">even his</span> wrath, is gone forth, a sweeping tempest: it shall burst upon the head of the wicked. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR30_24" data-id="JR30_24">The fierce anger of Jehovah shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall understand it. </span>
