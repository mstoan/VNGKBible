<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX2_1" data-id="EX2_1">And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX2_2" data-id="EX2_2">And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX2_3" data-id="EX2_3">And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch; and she put the child therein, and laid it in the flags by the river’s brink.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX2_4" data-id="EX2_4">And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX2_5" data-id="EX2_5">And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river-side; and she saw the ark among the flags, and sent her handmaid to fetch it. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX2_6" data-id="EX2_6">And she opened it, and saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews’ children. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX2_7" data-id="EX2_7">Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX2_8" data-id="EX2_8">And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maiden went and called the child’s mother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX2_9" data-id="EX2_9">And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX2_10" data-id="EX2_10">And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX2_11" data-id="EX2_11">And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX2_12" data-id="EX2_12">And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX2_13" data-id="EX2_13">And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews were striving together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX2_14" data-id="EX2_14">And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Thinkest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX2_15" data-id="EX2_15">Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well. </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX2_16" data-id="EX2_16">Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX2_17" data-id="EX2_17">And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX2_18" data-id="EX2_18">And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to-day?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX2_19" data-id="EX2_19">And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX2_20" data-id="EX2_20">And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? Why is it that ye have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX2_21" data-id="EX2_21">And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX2_22" data-id="EX2_22">And she bare a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX2_23" data-id="EX2_23">And it came to pass in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX2_24" data-id="EX2_24">And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX2_25" data-id="EX2_25">And God saw the children of Israel, and God took knowledge <span class="add">of them</span>. </span>
