<div class="c">1</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_1" data-id="GL1_1">Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead), </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_2" data-id="GL1_2">and all the brethren that are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_3" data-id="GL1_3">Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_4" data-id="GL1_4">who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father: </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_5" data-id="GL1_5">to whom <span class="add">be</span> the glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_6" data-id="GL1_6">I marvel that ye are so quickly removing from him that called you in the grace of Christ unto a different gospel;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_7" data-id="GL1_7">which is not another <span class="add">gospel</span>: only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_8" data-id="GL1_8">But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach unto you any gospel other than that which we preached unto you, let him be anathema. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_9" data-id="GL1_9">As we have said before, so say I now again, If any man preacheth unto you any gospel other than that which ye received, let him be anathema. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_10" data-id="GL1_10">For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? or am I striving to please men? if I were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_11" data-id="GL1_11">For I make known to you, brethren, as touching the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not after man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_12" data-id="GL1_12">For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but <span class="add">it came to me</span> through revelation of Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_13" data-id="GL1_13">For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and made havoc of it: </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_14" data-id="GL1_14">and I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_15" data-id="GL1_15">But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me, <span class="add">even </span> from my mother’s womb, and called me through his grace,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_16" data-id="GL1_16">to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; straightway I conferred not with flesh and blood:</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_17" data-id="GL1_17">neither went I up to Jerusalem to them that were apostles before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned unto Damascus. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_18" data-id="GL1_18">Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_19" data-id="GL1_19">But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_20" data-id="GL1_20">Now touching the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_21" data-id="GL1_21">Then I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_22" data-id="GL1_22">And I was still unknown by face unto the churches of Judæa which were in Christ:</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_23" data-id="GL1_23">but they only heard say, He that once persecuted us now preacheth the faith of which he once made havoc;</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL1_24" data-id="GL1_24">and they glorified God in me.</span>
