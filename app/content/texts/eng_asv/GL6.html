<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_1" data-id="GL6_1">Brethren, even if a man be overtaken in any trespass, ye who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to thyself, lest thou also be tempted. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_2" data-id="GL6_2">Bear ye one anotherâ€™s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_3" data-id="GL6_3">For if a man thinketh himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_4" data-id="GL6_4">But let each man prove his own work, and then shall he have his glorying in regard of himself alone, and not of his neighbor. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_5" data-id="GL6_5">For each man shall bear his own burden.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_6" data-id="GL6_6">But let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_7" data-id="GL6_7">Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_8" data-id="GL6_8">For he that soweth unto his own flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_9" data-id="GL6_9">And let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_10" data-id="GL6_10">So then, as we have opportunity, let us work that which is good toward all men, and especially toward them that are of the household of the faith. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_11" data-id="GL6_11">See with how large letters I write unto you with mine own hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_12" data-id="GL6_12">As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_13" data-id="GL6_13">For not even they who receive circumcision do themselves keep the law; but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_14" data-id="GL6_14">But far be it from me to glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world hath been crucified unto me, and I unto the world. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_15" data-id="GL6_15">For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_16" data-id="GL6_16">And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace <span class="add">be</span> upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_17" data-id="GL6_17">Henceforth let no man trouble me; for I bear branded on my body the marks of Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL6_18" data-id="GL6_18">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen. </span>
