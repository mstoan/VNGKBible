<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_1" data-id="R214_1">So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_2" data-id="R214_2">And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Jehovah his God:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_3" data-id="R214_3">for he took away the foreign altars, and the high places, and brake down the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_4" data-id="R214_4">and commanded Judah to seek Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_5" data-id="R214_5">Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun-images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_6" data-id="R214_6">And he built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Jehovah had given him rest. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_7" data-id="R214_7">For he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars; the land is yet before us, because we have sought Jehovah our God; we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_8" data-id="R214_8">And Asa had an army that bare bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_9" data-id="R214_9">And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and he came unto Mareshah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_10" data-id="R214_10">Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_11" data-id="R214_11">And Asa cried unto Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, there is none besides thee to help, between the mighty and him that hath no strength: help us, O Jehovah our God; for we rely on thee, and in thy name are we come against this multitude. O Jehovah, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_12" data-id="R214_12">So Jehovah smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_13" data-id="R214_13">And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Jehovah, and before his host; and they carried away very much booty. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_14" data-id="R214_14">And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of Jehovah came upon them: and they despoiled all the cities; for there was much spoil in them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v R214_15" data-id="R214_15">They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.</span>
