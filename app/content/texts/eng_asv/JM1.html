<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_1" data-id="JM1_1">James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are of the Dispersion, greeting.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_2" data-id="JM1_2">Count it all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into manifold temptations;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_3" data-id="JM1_3">knowing that the proving of your faith worketh patience.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_4" data-id="JM1_4">And let patience have <span class="add">its</span> perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, lacking in nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_5" data-id="JM1_5">But if any of you lacketh wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_6" data-id="JM1_6">But let him ask in faith, nothing doubting: for he that doubteth is like the surge of the sea driven by the wind and tossed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_7" data-id="JM1_7">For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_8" data-id="JM1_8">a doubleminded man, unstable in all his ways.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_9" data-id="JM1_9">But let the brother of low degree glory in his high estate:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_10" data-id="JM1_10">and the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_11" data-id="JM1_11">For the sun ariseth with the scorching wind, and withereth the grass; and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his goings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_12" data-id="JM1_12">Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he hath been approved, he shall receive the crown of life, which <span class="add">the Lord</span> promised to them that love him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_13" data-id="JM1_13">Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempteth no man: </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_14" data-id="JM1_14">but each man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_15" data-id="JM1_15">Then the lust, when it hath conceived, beareth sin: and the sin, when it is fullgrown, bringeth forth death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_16" data-id="JM1_16">Be not deceived, my beloved brethren.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_17" data-id="JM1_17">Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, neither shadow that is cast by turning. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_18" data-id="JM1_18">Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_19" data-id="JM1_19">Ye know <span class="add">this</span>, my beloved brethren. But let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_20" data-id="JM1_20">for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_21" data-id="JM1_21">Wherefore putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_22" data-id="JM1_22">But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deluding your own selves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_23" data-id="JM1_23">For if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror:</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_24" data-id="JM1_24">for he beholdeth himself, and goeth away, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_25" data-id="JM1_25">But he that looketh into the perfect law, the <span class="add">law</span> of liberty, and <span class="add">so</span> continueth, being not a hearer that forgetteth but a doer that worketh, this man shall be blessed in his doing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_26" data-id="JM1_26">If any man thinketh himself to be religious, while he bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his heart, this manâ€™s religion is vain. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_27" data-id="JM1_27">Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, <span class="add">and</span> to keep oneself unspotted from the world. </span>
