<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R219_3" data-id="R219_3">Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast put away the Asheroth out of the land, and hast set thy heart to seek God. </span>

<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R219_4" data-id="R219_4">And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again among the people from Beer-sheba to the hill-country of Ephraim, and brought them back unto Jehovah, the God of their fathers. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R219_5" data-id="R219_5">And he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R219_6" data-id="R219_6">and said to the judges, Consider what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for Jehovah; and <span class="add">he is</span> with you in the judgment. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R219_7" data-id="R219_7">Now therefore let the fear of Jehovah be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with Jehovah our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes. </span>
