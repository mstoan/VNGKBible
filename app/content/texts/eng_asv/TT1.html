<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_1" data-id="TT1_1">Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness, </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_2" data-id="TT1_2">in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before times eternal;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_3" data-id="TT1_3">but in his own seasons manifested his word in the message, wherewith I was intrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour; </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_4" data-id="TT1_4">to Titus, my true child after a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_5" data-id="TT1_5">For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that were wanting, and appoint elders in every city, as I gave thee charge; </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_6" data-id="TT1_6">if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children that believe, who are not accused of riot or unruly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_7" data-id="TT1_7">For the bishop must be blameless, as God’s steward; not self-willed, not soon angry, no brawler, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_8" data-id="TT1_8">but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_9" data-id="TT1_9">holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able both to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict the gainsayers. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_10" data-id="TT1_10">For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_11" data-id="TT1_11">whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_12" data-id="TT1_12">One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_13" data-id="TT1_13">This testimony is true. For which cause reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_14" data-id="TT1_14">not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_15" data-id="TT1_15">To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT1_16" data-id="TT1_16">They profess that they know God; but by their works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate. </span>
