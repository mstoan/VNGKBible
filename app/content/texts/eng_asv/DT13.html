<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT13_2" data-id="DT13_2">and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT13_3" data-id="DT13_3">thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or unto that dreamer of dreams: for Jehovah your God proveth you, to know whether ye love Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul.</span>

So shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.</span>
