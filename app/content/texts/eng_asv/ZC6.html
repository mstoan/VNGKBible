<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC6_1" data-id="ZC6_1">And again I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC6_2" data-id="ZC6_2">In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC6_3" data-id="ZC6_3">and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled strong horses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC6_4" data-id="ZC6_4">Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC6_5" data-id="ZC6_5">And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four winds of heaven, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC6_6" data-id="ZC6_6"> <span class="add">The chariot</span> wherein are the black horses goeth forth toward the north country; and the white went forth after them; and the grizzled went forth toward the south country. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC6_7" data-id="ZC6_7">And the strong went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC6_8" data-id="ZC6_8">Then cried he to me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, they that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC6_9" data-id="ZC6_9">And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC6_10" data-id="ZC6_10">Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah; and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, whither they are come from Babylon;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC6_11" data-id="ZC6_11">yea, take <span class="add">of them</span> silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest; </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC6_12" data-id="ZC6_12">and speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, saying, Behold, the man whose name is the Branch: and he shall grow up out of his place; and he shall build the temple of Jehovah;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC6_13" data-id="ZC6_13">even he shall build the temple of Jehovah; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC6_14" data-id="ZC6_14">And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of Jehovah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC6_15" data-id="ZC6_15">And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of Jehovah; and ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me unto you. And <span class="add">this </span> shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of Jehovah your God.</span>
