<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK4_1" data-id="EK4_1">Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and portray upon it a city, even Jerusalem:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK4_2" data-id="EK4_2">and lay siege against it, and build forts against it, and cast up a mound against it; set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it round about. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK4_3" data-id="EK4_3">And take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face toward it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK4_4" data-id="EK4_4">Moreover lie thou upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it; <span class="add">according to</span> the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK4_5" data-id="EK4_5">For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be unto thee a number of days, even three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK4_6" data-id="EK4_6">And again, when thou hast accomplished these, thou shalt lie on thy right side, and shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah: forty days, each day for a year, have I appointed it unto thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK4_7" data-id="EK4_7">And thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with thine arm uncovered; and thou shalt prophesy against it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK4_8" data-id="EK4_8">And, behold, I lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to the other, till thou hast accomplished the days of thy siege. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK4_9" data-id="EK4_9">Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof; <span class="add">according to</span> the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, even three hundred and ninety days, shalt thou eat thereof. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK4_10" data-id="EK4_10">And thy food which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK4_11" data-id="EK4_11">And thou shalt drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK4_12" data-id="EK4_12">And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it in their sight with dung that cometh out of man.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK4_14" data-id="EK4_14">Then said I, Ah Lord Jehovah! behold, my soul hath not been polluted; for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK4_15" data-id="EK4_15">Then he said unto me, See, I have given thee cow’s dung for man’s dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread thereon.</span>
