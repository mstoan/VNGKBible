<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER1_1" data-id="ER1_1">Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and <span class="add">put it</span> also in writing, saying, </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER1_2" data-id="ER1_2">Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath Jehovah, the God of heaven, given me; and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER1_3" data-id="ER1_3">Whosoever there is among you of all his people, his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of Jehovah, the God of Israel (he is God), which is in Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER1_4" data-id="ER1_4">And whosoever is left, in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, besides the freewill-offering for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER1_6" data-id="ER1_6">And all they that were round about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER1_7" data-id="ER1_7">Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of Jehovah, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put in the house of his gods; </span>
