<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK9_1" data-id="EK9_1">Then he cried in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause ye them that have charge over the city to draw near, every man with his destroying weapon in his hand. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK9_2" data-id="EK9_2">And behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lieth toward the north, every man with his slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man in the midst of them clothed in linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side. And they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK9_3" data-id="EK9_3">And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house: and he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer’s inkhorn by his side.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK9_4" data-id="EK9_4">And Jehovah said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK9_5" data-id="EK9_5">And to the others he said in my hearing, Go ye through the city after him, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity; </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK9_6" data-id="EK9_6">slay utterly the old man, the young man and the virgin, and little children and women; but come not near any man upon whom is the mark: and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the old men that were before the house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK9_7" data-id="EK9_7">And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and smote in the city. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK9_8" data-id="EK9_8">And it came to pass, while they were smiting, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord Jehovah! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy wrath upon Jerusalem?</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK9_9" data-id="EK9_9">Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of wrestling <span class="add">of judgment</span>: for they say, Jehovah hath forsaken the land, and Jehovah seeth not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK9_10" data-id="EK9_10">And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way upon their head.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK9_11" data-id="EK9_11">And behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me. </span>
