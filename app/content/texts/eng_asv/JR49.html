<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR49_6" data-id="JR49_6">But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR49_7" data-id="JR49_7">Of Edom. Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished? </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR49_8" data-id="JR49_8">Flee ye, turn back, dwell in the depths, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I shall visit him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR49_9" data-id="JR49_9">If grape-gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, would they not destroy till they had enough? </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR49_10" data-id="JR49_10">But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is destroyed, and his brethren, and his neighbors; and he is not. </span>
