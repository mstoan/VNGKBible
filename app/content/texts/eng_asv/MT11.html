<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT11_1" data-id="MT11_1">And it came to pass when Jesus had finished commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and preach in their cities. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT11_2" data-id="MT11_2">Now when John heard in the prison the works of the Christ, he sent by his disciples</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT11_3" data-id="MT11_3">and said unto him, Art thou he that cometh, or look we for another?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT11_4" data-id="MT11_4">And Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and tell John the things which ye hear and see:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT11_5" data-id="MT11_5">the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good tidings preached to them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT11_6" data-id="MT11_6">And blessed is he, whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT11_7" data-id="MT11_7">And as these went their way, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to behold? a reed shaken with the wind? </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT11_8" data-id="MT11_8">But what went ye out to see? a man clothed in soft <span class="add">raiment</span>? Behold, they that wear soft <span class="add">raiment</span> are in kingsâ€™ houses. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT11_9" data-id="MT11_9">But wherefore went ye out? to see a prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.</span>

<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT11_20" data-id="MT11_20">Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT11_21" data-id="MT11_21">Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT11_22" data-id="MT11_22">But I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment, than for you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT11_23" data-id="MT11_23">And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt go down unto Hades: for if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in thee, it would have remained until this day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT11_24" data-id="MT11_24">But I say unto you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.</span>

<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT11_25" data-id="MT11_25">At that season Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding, and didst reveal them unto babes:</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT11_26" data-id="MT11_26">yea, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in thy sight.</span>
