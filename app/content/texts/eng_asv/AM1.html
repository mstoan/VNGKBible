<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM1_2" data-id="AM1_2">And he said, Jehovah will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the pastures of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM1_3" data-id="AM1_3">Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Damascus, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM1_4" data-id="AM1_4">but I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM1_5" data-id="AM1_5">And I will break the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the valley of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden; and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM1_6" data-id="AM1_6">Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Gaza, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they carried away captive the whole people, to deliver them up to Edom:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM1_7" data-id="AM1_7">but I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM1_8" data-id="AM1_8">And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon; and I will turn my hand against Ekron; and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM1_9" data-id="AM1_9">Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Tyre, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they delivered up the whole people to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM1_10" data-id="AM1_10">but I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM1_12" data-id="AM1_12">but I will send a fire upon Teman, and it shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM1_14" data-id="AM1_14">But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind; </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM1_15" data-id="AM1_15">and their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith Jehovah.</span>
