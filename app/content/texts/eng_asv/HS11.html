<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_1" data-id="HS11_1">When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_2" data-id="HS11_2">The more <span class="add">the prophets</span> called them, the more they went from them: they sacrificed unto the Baalim, and burned incense to graven images. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_3" data-id="HS11_3">Yet I taught Ephraim to walk; I took them on my arms; but they knew not that I healed them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_4" data-id="HS11_4">I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as they that lift up the yoke on their jaws; and I laid food before them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_5" data-id="HS11_5">They shall not return into the land of Egypt; but the Assyrian shall be their king, because they refused to return <span class="add">to me</span>. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_6" data-id="HS11_6">And the sword shall fall upon their cities, and shall consume their bars, and devour <span class="add">them</span>, because of their own counsels. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_7" data-id="HS11_7">And my people are bent on backsliding from me: though they call them to <span class="add">him that is</span> on high, none at all will exalt <span class="add">him</span>.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_8" data-id="HS11_8">How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? <span class="add">how</span> shall I cast thee off, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? <span class="add">how</span> shall I set thee as Zeboiim? my heart is turned within me, my compassions are kindled together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_9" data-id="HS11_9">I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee; and I will not come in wrath. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_10" data-id="HS11_10">They shall walk after Jehovah, who will roar like a lion; for he will roar, and the children shall come trembling from the west. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_11" data-id="HS11_11">They shall come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will make them to dwell in their houses, saith Jehovah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS11_12" data-id="HS11_12">Ephraim compasseth me about with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the Holy One. </span>
