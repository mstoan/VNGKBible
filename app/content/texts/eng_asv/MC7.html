<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_1" data-id="MC7_1">Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat; my soul desireth the first-ripe fig. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_2" data-id="MC7_2">The godly man is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_3" data-id="MC7_3">Their hands are upon that which is evil to do it diligently; the prince asketh, and the judge <span class="add">is ready</span> for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth the evil desire of his soul: thus they weave it together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_4" data-id="MC7_4">The best of them is as a brier; the most upright is <span class="add">worse </span> than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen, even thy visitation, is come; now shall be their perplexity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_5" data-id="MC7_5">Trust ye not in a neighbor; put ye not confidence in a friend; keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_6" data-id="MC7_6">For the son dishonoreth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a manâ€™s enemies are the men of his own house. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_7" data-id="MC7_7">But as for me, I will look unto Jehovah; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_8" data-id="MC7_8">Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, Jehovah will be a light unto me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_9" data-id="MC7_9">I will bear the indignation of Jehovah, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, <span class="add">and</span> I shall behold his righteousness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_10" data-id="MC7_10">Then mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her who said unto me, Where is Jehovah thy God? Mine eyes shall see <span class="add">my desire</span> upon her; now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_11" data-id="MC7_11">A day for building thy walls! in that day shall the decree be far removed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_12" data-id="MC7_12">In that day shall they come unto thee from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea, and <span class="add">from </span> mountain to mountain. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_13" data-id="MC7_13">Yet shall the land be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_14" data-id="MC7_14">Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thy heritage, which dwell solitarily, in the forest in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_15" data-id="MC7_15">As in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt will I show unto them marvellous things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_16" data-id="MC7_16">The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might; they shall lay their hand upon their mouth; their ears shall be deaf. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_17" data-id="MC7_17">They shall lick the dust like a serpent; like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their close places; they shall come with fear unto Jehovah our God, and shall be afraid because of thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_18" data-id="MC7_18">Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth over the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in lovingkindness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_19" data-id="MC7_19">He will again have compassion upon us; he will tread our iniquities under foot; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC7_20" data-id="MC7_20">Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, <span class="add">and</span> the lovingkindness to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old. </span>
