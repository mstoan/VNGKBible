<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_1" data-id="C23_1">Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? or need we, as do some, epistles of commendation to you or from you?</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_2" data-id="C23_2">Ye are our epistle, written in our hearts, known and read of all men;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_3" data-id="C23_3">being made manifest that ye are an epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in tables <span class="add">that are</span> hearts of flesh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_4" data-id="C23_4">And such confidence have we through Christ to God-ward:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_5" data-id="C23_5">not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_6" data-id="C23_6">who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_7" data-id="C23_7">But if the ministration of death, written, <span class="add">and</span> engraven on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look stedfastly upon the face of Moses for the glory of his face; which <span class="add">glory </span> was passing away: </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_8" data-id="C23_8">how shall not rather the ministration of the spirit be with glory?</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_9" data-id="C23_9">For if the ministration of condemnation hath glory, much rather doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_10" data-id="C23_10">For verily that which hath been made glorious hath not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasseth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_11" data-id="C23_11">For if that which passeth away <span class="add">was</span> with glory, much more that which remaineth <span class="add">is</span> in glory. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_12" data-id="C23_12">Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_13" data-id="C23_13">and <span class="add">are</span> not as Moses, <span class="add">who</span> put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel should not look stedfastly on the end of that which was passing away: </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_14" data-id="C23_14">but their minds were hardened: for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remaineth, it not being revealed <span class="add">to them </span> that it is done away in Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_15" data-id="C23_15">But unto this day, whensoever Moses is read, a veil lieth upon their heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_16" data-id="C23_16">But whensoever it shall turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_17" data-id="C23_17">Now the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, <span class="add">there</span> is liberty. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_18" data-id="C23_18">But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord the Spirit. </span>
