<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_1" data-id="CL3_1">If then ye were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_2" data-id="CL3_2">Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are upon the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_3" data-id="CL3_3">For ye died, and your life is hid with Christ in God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_4" data-id="CL3_4">When Christ, <span class="add">who is</span> our life, shall be manifested, then shall ye also with him be manifested in glory.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_5" data-id="CL3_5">Put to death therefore your members which are upon the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry; </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_6" data-id="CL3_6">for which things’ sake cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_7" data-id="CL3_7">wherein ye also once walked, when ye lived in these things;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_8" data-id="CL3_8">but now do ye also put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, railing, shameful speaking out of your mouth:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_9" data-id="CL3_9">lie not one to another; seeing that ye have put off the old man with his doings,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_10" data-id="CL3_10">and have put on the new man, that is being renewed unto knowledge after the image of him that created him:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_11" data-id="CL3_11">where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman; but Christ is all, and in all. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_12" data-id="CL3_12">Put on therefore, as God’s elect, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, longsuffering;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_13" data-id="CL3_13">forbearing one another, and forgiving each other, if any man have a complaint against any; even as the Lord forgave you, so also do ye: </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_14" data-id="CL3_14">and above all these things <span class="add">put on</span> love, which is the bond of perfectness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_15" data-id="CL3_15">And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to the which also ye were called in one body; and be ye thankful.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_16" data-id="CL3_16">Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms <span class="add">and</span> hymns <span class="add">and</span> spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts unto God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_17" data-id="CL3_17">And whatsoever ye do, in word or in deed, <span class="add">do</span> all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_18" data-id="CL3_18">Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_19" data-id="CL3_19">Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_20" data-id="CL3_20">Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing in the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_21" data-id="CL3_21">Fathers, provoke not your children, that they be not discouraged.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_22" data-id="CL3_22">Servants, obey in all things them that are your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord: </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_23" data-id="CL3_23">whatsoever ye do, work heartily, as unto the Lord, and not unto men;</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_24" data-id="CL3_24">knowing that from the Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance: ye serve the Lord Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v CL3_25" data-id="CL3_25">For he that doeth wrong shall receive again for the wrong that he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.</span>
