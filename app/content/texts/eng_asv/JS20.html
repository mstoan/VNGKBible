<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS20_4" data-id="JS20_4">And he shall flee unto one of those cities, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city; and they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS20_5" data-id="JS20_5">And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver up the manslayer into his hand; because he smote his neighbor unawares, and hated him not beforetime. </span>
