<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_1" data-id="AC24_1">And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with certain elders, and <span class="add">with</span> an orator, one Tertullus; and they informed the governor against Paul.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_2" data-id="AC24_2">And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy much peace, and that by thy providence evils are corrected for this nation, </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_3" data-id="AC24_3">we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_4" data-id="AC24_4">But, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I entreat thee to hear us of thy clemency a few words.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_5" data-id="AC24_5">For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes: </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_6" data-id="AC24_6">who moreover assayed to profane the temple: on whom also we laid hold: <span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span><span class="note" id="note-3"><a class="key" href="#footnote-3">and</a></span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_7" data-id="AC24_7"> <span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span><span class="note" id="note-3"><a class="key" href="#footnote-3">But</a></span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_8" data-id="AC24_8"> <span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span><span class="note" id="note-3"><a class="key" href="#footnote-3">commanding</a></span> from whom thou wilt be able, by examining him thyself, to take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_9" data-id="AC24_9">And the Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that these things were so.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_10" data-id="AC24_10">And when the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, Paul answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I cheerfully make my defence: </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_11" data-id="AC24_11">seeing that thou canst take knowledge that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem:</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_12" data-id="AC24_12">and neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_13" data-id="AC24_13">Neither can they prove to thee the things whereof they now accuse me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_14" data-id="AC24_14">But this I confess unto thee, that after the Way which they call a sect, so serve I the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_15" data-id="AC24_15">having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection both of the just and unjust. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_16" data-id="AC24_16">Herein I also exercise myself to have a conscience void of offence toward God and men always.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_17" data-id="AC24_17">Now after some years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings:</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_18" data-id="AC24_18">amidst which they found me purified in the temple, with no crowd, nor yet with tumult: but <span class="add">there were</span> certain Jews from Asia— </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_19" data-id="AC24_19">who ought to have been here before thee, and to make accusation, if they had aught against me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_20" data-id="AC24_20">Or else let these men themselves say what wrong-doing they found when I stood before the council,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_21" data-id="AC24_21">except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question before you this day. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_22" data-id="AC24_22">But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will determine your matter. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_23" data-id="AC24_23">And he gave order to the centurion that he should be kept in charge, and should have indulgence; and not to forbid any of his friends to minister unto him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_24" data-id="AC24_24">But after certain days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_25" data-id="AC24_25">And as he reasoned of righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, Go thy way for this time; and when I have a convenient season, I will call thee unto me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_26" data-id="AC24_26">He hoped withal that money would be given him of Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_27" data-id="AC24_27">But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds. </span>
