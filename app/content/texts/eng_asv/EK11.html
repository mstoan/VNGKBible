<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK11_1" data-id="EK11_1">Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of Jehovah’s house, which looketh eastward: and behold, at the door of the gate five and twenty men; and I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK11_2" data-id="EK11_2">And he said unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise iniquity, and that give wicked counsel in this city;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK11_3" data-id="EK11_3">that say, <span class="add">The time</span> is not near to build houses: this <span class="add">city</span> is the caldron, and we are the flesh. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK11_4" data-id="EK11_4">Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK11_5" data-id="EK11_5">And the Spirit of Jehovah fell upon me, and he said unto me, Speak, Thus saith Jehovah: Thus have ye said, O house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK11_6" data-id="EK11_6">Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK11_7" data-id="EK11_7">Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this <span class="add">city</span> is the caldron; but ye shall be brought forth out of the midst of it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK11_8" data-id="EK11_8">Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword upon you, saith the Lord Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK11_9" data-id="EK11_9">And I will bring you forth out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK11_10" data-id="EK11_10">Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK11_12" data-id="EK11_12">and ye shall know that I am Jehovah: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither have ye executed mine ordinances, but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK11_13" data-id="EK11_13">And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord Jehovah! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK11_14" data-id="EK11_14">And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK11_16" data-id="EK11_16">Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Whereas I have removed them far off among the nations, and whereas I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they are come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK11_17" data-id="EK11_17">Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK11_18" data-id="EK11_18">And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK11_19" data-id="EK11_19">And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh; </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK11_20" data-id="EK11_20">that they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK11_21" data-id="EK11_21">But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord Jehovah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK11_22" data-id="EK11_22">Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels were beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK11_23" data-id="EK11_23">And the glory of Jehovah went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK11_24" data-id="EK11_24">And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK11_25" data-id="EK11_25">Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that Jehovah had showed me.</span>
