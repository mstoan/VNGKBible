<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_1" data-id="MK11_1">And when they draw nigh unto Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth two of his disciples, </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_2" data-id="MK11_2">and saith unto them, Go your way into the village that is over against you: and straightway as ye enter into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat; loose him, and bring him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_3" data-id="MK11_3">And if any one say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye, The Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him back hither. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_4" data-id="MK11_4">And they went away, and found a colt tied at the door without in the open street; and they loose him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_5" data-id="MK11_5">And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_6" data-id="MK11_6">And they said unto them even as Jesus had said: and they let them go.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_7" data-id="MK11_7">And they bring the colt unto Jesus, and cast on him their garments; and he sat upon him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_8" data-id="MK11_8">And many spread their garments upon the way; and others branches, which they had cut from the fields.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_9" data-id="MK11_9">And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, Hosanna; Blessed <span class="add">is</span> he that cometh in the name of the Lord: </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_10" data-id="MK11_10">Blessed <span class="add">is</span> the kingdom that cometh, <span class="add">the kingdom </span> of our father David: Hosanna in the highest. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_11" data-id="MK11_11">And he entered into Jerusalem, into the temple; and when he had looked round about upon all things, it being now eventide, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_12" data-id="MK11_12">And on the morrow, when they were come out from Bethany, he hungered.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_13" data-id="MK11_13">And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find anything thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for it was not the season of figs. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_14" data-id="MK11_14">And he answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit from thee henceforward for ever. And his disciples heard it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_15" data-id="MK11_15">And they come to Jerusalem: and he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and them that bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_16" data-id="MK11_16">and he would not suffer that any man should carry a vessel through the temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_17" data-id="MK11_17">And he taught, and said unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? but ye have made it a den of robbers. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_18" data-id="MK11_18">And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, for all the multitude was astonished at his teaching. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_19" data-id="MK11_19">And every evening he went forth out of the city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_20" data-id="MK11_20">And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_21" data-id="MK11_21">And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_22" data-id="MK11_22">And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_23" data-id="MK11_23">Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that what he saith cometh to pass; he shall have it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_24" data-id="MK11_24">Therefore I say unto you, All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_25" data-id="MK11_25">And whensoever ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any one; that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_26" data-id="MK11_26"> <span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span><span class="note" id="note-3"><a class="key" href="#footnote-3">But</a></span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_27" data-id="MK11_27">And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders; </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_28" data-id="MK11_28">and they said unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? or who gave thee this authority to do these things?</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_29" data-id="MK11_29">And Jesus said unto them, I will ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_30" data-id="MK11_30">The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? answer me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_31" data-id="MK11_31">And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_32" data-id="MK11_32">But should we say, From menâ€”they feared the people: for all verily held John to be a prophet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_33" data-id="MK11_33">And they answered Jesus and say, We know not. And Jesus saith unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things. </span>
