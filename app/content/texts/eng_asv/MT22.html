<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_1" data-id="MT22_1">And Jesus answered and spake again in parables unto them, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_2" data-id="MT22_2">The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_3" data-id="MT22_3">and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the marriage feast: and they would not come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_4" data-id="MT22_4">Again he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them that are bidden, Behold, I have made ready my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage feast.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_5" data-id="MT22_5">But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_6" data-id="MT22_6">and the rest laid hold on his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_7" data-id="MT22_7">But the king was wroth; and he sent his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_8" data-id="MT22_8">Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they that were bidden were not worthy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_9" data-id="MT22_9">Go ye therefore unto the partings of the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage feast.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_10" data-id="MT22_10">And those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was filled with guests. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_11" data-id="MT22_11">But when the king came in to behold the guests, he saw there a man who had not on a wedding-garment:</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_12" data-id="MT22_12">and he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding-garment? And he was speechless.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_13" data-id="MT22_13">Then the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and cast him out into the outer darkness; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_14" data-id="MT22_14">For many are called, but few chosen.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_15" data-id="MT22_15">Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might ensnare him in <span class="add">his</span> talk. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_16" data-id="MT22_16">And they send to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, and carest not for any one: for thou regardest not the person of men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_17" data-id="MT22_17">Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Cæsar, or not?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_18" data-id="MT22_18">But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why make ye trial of me, ye hypocrites?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_19" data-id="MT22_19">Show me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a denarius.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_20" data-id="MT22_20">And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_21" data-id="MT22_21">They say unto him, Cæsar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_22" data-id="MT22_22">And when they heard it, they marvelled, and left him, and went away.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_23" data-id="MT22_23">On that day there came to him Sadducees, they that say that there is no resurrection: and they asked him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_24" data-id="MT22_24">saying, Teacher, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_25" data-id="MT22_25">Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first married and deceased, and having no seed left his wife unto his brother; </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_26" data-id="MT22_26">in like manner the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_27" data-id="MT22_27">And after them all, the woman died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_28" data-id="MT22_28">In the resurrection therefore whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_29" data-id="MT22_29">But Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_30" data-id="MT22_30">For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as angels in heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_31" data-id="MT22_31">But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_32" data-id="MT22_32">I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not <span class="add">the God</span> of the dead, but of the living. </span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_33" data-id="MT22_33">And when the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_34" data-id="MT22_34">But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, gathered themselves together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_35" data-id="MT22_35">And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, trying him:</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_36" data-id="MT22_36">Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_37" data-id="MT22_37">And he said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_38" data-id="MT22_38">This is the great and first commandment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_39" data-id="MT22_39">And a second like <span class="add">unto it</span> is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_40" data-id="MT22_40">On these two commandments the whole law hangeth, and the prophets.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_41" data-id="MT22_41">Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_42" data-id="MT22_42">saying, What think ye of the Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, <span class="add">The son</span> of David. </span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_43" data-id="MT22_43">He saith unto them, How then doth David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_44" data-id="MT22_44">The Lord said unto my Lord,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v MT22_44" data-id="MT22_44">Sit thou on my right hand,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v MT22_44" data-id="MT22_44">Till I put thine enemies underneath thy feet?</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_45" data-id="MT22_45">If David then calleth him Lord, how is he his son?</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT22_46" data-id="MT22_46">And no one was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.</span>
