<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS54_2" data-id="IS54_2">Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations; spare not: lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes. </span>

<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS54_5" data-id="IS54_5">For thy Maker is thy husband; Jehovah of hosts is his name: and the Holy One of Israel is thy Redeemer; the God of the whole earth shall he be called. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS54_6" data-id="IS54_6">For Jehovah hath called thee as a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, even a wife of youth, when she is cast off, saith thy God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS54_7" data-id="IS54_7">For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS54_8" data-id="IS54_8">In overflowing wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting lovingkindness will I have mercy on thee, saith Jehovah thy Redeemer. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS54_9" data-id="IS54_9">For this is <span class="add">as</span> the waters of Noah unto me; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I will not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS54_10" data-id="IS54_10">For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed; but my lovingkindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall my covenant of peace be removed, saith Jehovah that hath mercy on thee.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS54_15" data-id="IS54_15">Behold, they may gather together, but not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall because of thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS54_16" data-id="IS54_16">Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the fire of coals, and bringeth forth a weapon for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy. </span>
