<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_1" data-id="EP2_1">And you <span class="add">did he make alive,</span> when ye were dead through your trespasses and sins,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_2" data-id="EP2_2">wherein ye once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the powers of the air, of the spirit that now worketh in the sons of disobedience; </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_3" data-id="EP2_3">among whom we also all once lived in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest:â€” </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_4" data-id="EP2_4">but God, being rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_5" data-id="EP2_5">even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace have ye been saved),</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_6" data-id="EP2_6">and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly <span class="add">places</span>, in Christ Jesus: </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_7" data-id="EP2_7">that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_8" data-id="EP2_8">for by grace have ye been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, <span class="add">it is</span> the gift of God; </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_9" data-id="EP2_9">not of works, that no man should glory.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_10" data-id="EP2_10">For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God afore prepared that we should walk in them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_11" data-id="EP2_11">Wherefore remember, that once ye, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision, in the flesh, made by hands; </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_12" data-id="EP2_12">that ye were at that time separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_13" data-id="EP2_13">But now in Christ Jesus ye that once were far off are made nigh in the blood of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_14" data-id="EP2_14">For he is our peace, who made both one, and brake down the middle wall of partition,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_15" data-id="EP2_15">having abolished in his flesh the enmity, <span class="add">even</span> the law of commandments <span class="add">contained</span> in ordinances; that he might create in himself of the two one new man, <span class="add">so</span> making peace; </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_16" data-id="EP2_16">and might reconcile them both in one body unto God through the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_17" data-id="EP2_17">and he came and preached peace to you that were far off, and peace to them that were nigh:</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_18" data-id="EP2_18">for through him we both have our access in one Spirit unto the Father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_19" data-id="EP2_19">So then ye are no more strangers and sojourners, but ye are fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_20" data-id="EP2_20">being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief corner stone;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_21" data-id="EP2_21">in whom each several building, fitly framed together, groweth into a holy temple in the Lord;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP2_22" data-id="EP2_22">in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God in the Spirit.</span>
