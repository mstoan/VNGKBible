<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_1" data-id="PP3_1">Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not irksome, but for you it is safe. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_2" data-id="PP3_2">Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_3" data-id="PP3_3">for we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh: </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_4" data-id="PP3_4">though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh: if any other man thinketh to have confidence in the flesh, I yet more: </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_5" data-id="PP3_5">circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee; </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_6" data-id="PP3_6">as touching zeal, persecuting the church; as touching the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_7" data-id="PP3_7">Howbeit what things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_8" data-id="PP3_8">Yea verily, and I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but refuse, that I may gain Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_9" data-id="PP3_9">and be found in him, not having a righteousness of mine own, <span class="add">even </span> that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith: </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_10" data-id="PP3_10">that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed unto his death; </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_11" data-id="PP3_11">if by any means I may attain unto the resurrection from the dead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_12" data-id="PP3_12">Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect: but I press on, if so be that I may lay hold on that for which also I was laid hold on by Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_13" data-id="PP3_13">Brethren, I count not myself yet to have laid hold: but one thing <span class="add">I do</span>, forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching forward to the things which are before,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_14" data-id="PP3_14">I press on toward the goal unto the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_15" data-id="PP3_15">Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything ye are otherwise minded, this also shall God reveal unto you: </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_16" data-id="PP3_16">only, whereunto we have attained, by that same <span class="add">rule</span> let us walk.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_17" data-id="PP3_17">Brethren, be ye imitators together of me, and mark them that so walk even as ye have us for an ensample.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_18" data-id="PP3_18">For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, <span class="add">that they are</span> the enemies of the cross of Christ: </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_19" data-id="PP3_19">whose end is perdition, whose god is the belly, and <span class="add">whose </span> glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_20" data-id="PP3_20">For our citizenship is in heaven; whence also we wait for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_21" data-id="PP3_21">who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation, <span class="add">that it may be </span> conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working whereby he is able even to subject all things unto himself.</span>
