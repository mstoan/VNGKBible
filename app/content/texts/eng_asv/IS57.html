<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS57_1" data-id="IS57_1">The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil <span class="add">to come</span>. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS57_2" data-id="IS57_2">He entereth into peace; they rest in their beds, each one that walketh in his uprightness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS57_3" data-id="IS57_3">But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the harlot.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS57_4" data-id="IS57_4">Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, and put out the tongue? are ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood, </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS57_5" data-id="IS57_5">ye that inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree; that slay the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks? </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS57_6" data-id="IS57_6">Among the smooth <span class="add">stones</span> of the valley is thy portion; they, they are thy lot; even to them hast thou poured a drink-offering, thou hast offered an oblation. Shall I be appeased for these things?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS57_7" data-id="IS57_7">Upon a high and lofty mountain hast thou set thy bed; thither also wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS57_8" data-id="IS57_8">And behind the doors and the posts hast thou set up thy memorial: for thou hast uncovered <span class="add">thyself</span> to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them: thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS57_9" data-id="IS57_9">And thou wentest to the king with oil, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thine ambassadors far off, and didst debase thyself even unto Sheol. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS57_10" data-id="IS57_10">Thou wast wearied with the length of thy way; yet saidst thou not, It is in vain: thou didst find a quickening of thy strength; therefore thou wast not faint. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS57_11" data-id="IS57_11">And of whom hast thou been afraid and in fear, that thou liest, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of long time, and thou fearest me not?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS57_12" data-id="IS57_12">I will declare thy righteousness; and as for thy works, they shall not profit thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS57_13" data-id="IS57_13">When thou criest, let them that thou hast gathered deliver thee; but the wind shall take them, a breath shall carry them all away: but he that taketh refuge in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS57_14" data-id="IS57_14">And he will say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS57_15" data-id="IS57_15">For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS57_16" data-id="IS57_16">For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth; for the spirit would faint before me, and the souls that I have made. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS57_17" data-id="IS57_17">For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him; I hid <span class="add">my face</span> and was wroth; and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS57_18" data-id="IS57_18">I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS57_19" data-id="IS57_19">I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him that is far off and to him that is near, saith Jehovah; and I will heal him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS57_20" data-id="IS57_20">But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it cannot rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS57_21" data-id="IS57_21">There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.</span>
