<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_1" data-id="NU11_1">And the people were as murmurers, <span class="add">speaking</span> evil in the ears of Jehovah: and when Jehovah heard it, his anger was kindled; and the fire of Jehovah burnt among them, and devoured in the uttermost part of the camp.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_2" data-id="NU11_2">And the people cried unto Moses; and Moses prayed unto Jehovah, and the fire abated.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_3" data-id="NU11_3">And the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of Jehovah burnt among them.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_4" data-id="NU11_4">And the mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat? </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_5" data-id="NU11_5">We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt for nought; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic: </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_6" data-id="NU11_6">but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all save this manna to look upon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_7" data-id="NU11_7">And the manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_8" data-id="NU11_8">The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_9" data-id="NU11_9">And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_10" data-id="NU11_10">And Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_11" data-id="NU11_11">And Moses said unto Jehovah, Wherefore hast thou dealt ill with thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me? </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_12" data-id="NU11_12">Have I conceived all this people? have I brought them forth, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father carrieth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_13" data-id="NU11_13">Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_14" data-id="NU11_14">I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_15" data-id="NU11_15">And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_16" data-id="NU11_16">And Jehovah said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_17" data-id="NU11_17">And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_18" data-id="NU11_18">And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore Jehovah will give you flesh, and ye shall eat. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_19" data-id="NU11_19">Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_20" data-id="NU11_20">but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you; because that ye have rejected Jehovah who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_21" data-id="NU11_21">And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_22" data-id="NU11_22">Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them? </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_23" data-id="NU11_23">And Jehovah said unto Moses, Is Jehovah’s hand waxed short? now shalt thou see whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_24" data-id="NU11_24">And Moses went out, and told the people the words of Jehovah: and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the Tent. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_25" data-id="NU11_25">And Jehovah came down in the cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did so no more.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_26" data-id="NU11_26">But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but had not gone out unto the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_27" data-id="NU11_27">And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_28" data-id="NU11_28">And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_29" data-id="NU11_29">And Moses said unto him, Art thou jealous for my sake? would that all Jehovah’s people were prophets, that Jehovah would put his Spirit upon them! </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_30" data-id="NU11_30">And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_31" data-id="NU11_31">And there went forth a wind from Jehovah, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day’s journey on this side, and a day’s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_32" data-id="NU11_32">And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_33" data-id="NU11_33">While the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague. </span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_34" data-id="NU11_34">And the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people that lusted.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU11_35" data-id="NU11_35">From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed unto Hazeroth; and they abode at Hazeroth.</span>
