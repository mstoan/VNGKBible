<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_2" data-id="LK11_2">And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Father, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_3" data-id="LK11_3">Give us day by day our daily bread.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_4" data-id="LK11_4">And forgive us our sins; for we ourselves also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And bring us not into temptation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_5" data-id="LK11_5">And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves; </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_6" data-id="LK11_6">for a friend of mine is come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_7" data-id="LK11_7">and he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee? </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_8" data-id="LK11_8">I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will arise and give him as many as he needeth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_9" data-id="LK11_9">And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</span>

<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_25" data-id="LK11_25">And when he is come, he findeth it swept and garnished.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_26" data-id="LK11_26">Then goeth he, and taketh <span class="add">to him</span> seven other spirits more evil than himself; and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_27" data-id="LK11_27">And it came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the breasts which thou didst suck.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_28" data-id="LK11_28">But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_29" data-id="LK11_29">And when the multitudes were gathering together unto him, he began to say, This generation is an evil generation: it seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_30" data-id="LK11_30">For even as Jonah became a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_31" data-id="LK11_31">The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and shall condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_32" data-id="LK11_32">The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here. </span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_33" data-id="LK11_33">No man, when he hath lighted a lamp, putteth it in a cellar, neither under the bushel, but on the stand, that they which enter in may see the light. </span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_34" data-id="LK11_34">The lamp of thy body is thine eye: when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when it is evil, thy body also is full of darkness. </span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_35" data-id="LK11_35">Look therefore whether the light that is in thee be not darkness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_36" data-id="LK11_36">If therefore thy whole body be full of light, having no part dark, it shall be wholly full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining doth give thee light. </span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_37" data-id="LK11_37">Now as he spake, a Pharisee asketh him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_38" data-id="LK11_38">And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first bathed himself before dinner.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_39" data-id="LK11_39">And the Lord said unto him, Now ye the Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter; but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness. </span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_40" data-id="LK11_40">Ye foolish ones, did not he that made the outside make the inside also?</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_41" data-id="LK11_41">But give for alms those things which are within; and behold, all things are clean unto you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_42" data-id="LK11_42">But woe unto you Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and every herb, and pass over justice and the love of God: but these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. </span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_43" data-id="LK11_43">Woe unto you Pharisees! for ye love the chief seats in the synagogues, and the salutations in the marketplaces.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_44" data-id="LK11_44">Woe unto you! for ye are as the tombs which appear not, and the men that walk over <span class="add">them</span> know it not. </span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_45" data-id="LK11_45">And one of the lawyers answering saith unto him, Teacher, in saying this thou reproachest us also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_46" data-id="LK11_46">And he said, Woe unto you lawyers also! for ye load men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers. </span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_47" data-id="LK11_47">Woe unto you! for ye build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_48" data-id="LK11_48">So ye are witnesses and consent unto the works of your fathers: for they killed them, and ye build <span class="add">their tombs</span>. </span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_49" data-id="LK11_49">Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send unto them prophets and apostles; and <span class="add">some</span> of them they shall kill and persecute; </span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_50" data-id="LK11_50">that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;</span>

<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_52" data-id="LK11_52">Woe unto you lawyers! for ye took away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered. </span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_53" data-id="LK11_53">And when he was come out from thence, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press upon <span class="add">him</span> vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things;</span>
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK11_54" data-id="LK11_54">laying wait for him, to catch something out of his mouth.</span>
