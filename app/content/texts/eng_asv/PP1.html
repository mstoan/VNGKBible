<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_1" data-id="PP1_1">Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus that are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_2" data-id="PP1_2">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_3" data-id="PP1_3">I thank my God upon all my remembrance of you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_4" data-id="PP1_4">always in every supplication of mine on behalf of you all making my supplication with joy,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_5" data-id="PP1_5">for your fellowship in furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_6" data-id="PP1_6">being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_7" data-id="PP1_7">even as it is right for me to be thus minded on behalf of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as, both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers with me of grace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_8" data-id="PP1_8">For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_9" data-id="PP1_9">And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_10" data-id="PP1_10">so that ye may approve the things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and void of offence unto the day of Christ;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_11" data-id="PP1_11">being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_12" data-id="PP1_12">Now I would have you know, brethren, that the things <span class="add">which happened</span> unto me have fallen out rather unto the progress of the gospel;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_13" data-id="PP1_13">so that my bonds became manifest in Christ throughout the whole prætorian guard, and to all the rest;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_14" data-id="PP1_14">and that most of the brethren in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_15" data-id="PP1_15">Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_16" data-id="PP1_16">the one <span class="add">do it</span> of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_17" data-id="PP1_17">but the other proclaim Christ of faction, not sincerely, thinking to raise up affliction for me in my bonds.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_18" data-id="PP1_18">What then? only that in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and therein I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_19" data-id="PP1_19">For I know that this shall turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_20" data-id="PP1_20">according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing shall I be put to shame, but <span class="add">that</span> with all boldness, as always, <span class="add">so </span> now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_21" data-id="PP1_21">For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_22" data-id="PP1_22">But if to live in the flesh,—<span class="add">if</span> this shall bring fruit from my work, then what I shall choose I know not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_23" data-id="PP1_23">But I am in a strait betwixt the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ; for it is very far better:</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_24" data-id="PP1_24">yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for your sake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_25" data-id="PP1_25">And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, yea, and abide with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith; </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_26" data-id="PP1_26">that your glorying may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_27" data-id="PP1_27">Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you or be absent, I may hear of your state, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the gospel;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_28" data-id="PP1_28">and in nothing affrighted by the adversaries: which is for them an evident token of perdition, but of your salvation, and that from God; </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_29" data-id="PP1_29">because to you it hath been granted in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf: </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_30" data-id="PP1_30">having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</span>
