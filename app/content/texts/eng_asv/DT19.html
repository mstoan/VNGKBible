<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_4" data-id="DT19_4">And this is the case of the manslayer, that shall flee thither and live: whoso killeth his neighbor unawares, and hated him not in time past; </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_5" data-id="DT19_5">as when a man goeth into the forest with his neighbor to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbor, so that he dieth; he shall flee unto one of these cities and live: </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_6" data-id="DT19_6">lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and smite him mortally; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.</span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_10" data-id="DT19_10">that innocent blood be not shed in the midst of thy land, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee. </span>
