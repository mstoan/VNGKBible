<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_2" data-id="DT19_2">thou shalt set apart three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to possess it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_3" data-id="DT19_3">Thou shalt prepare thee the way, and divide the borders of thy land, which Jehovah thy God causeth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every manslayer may flee thither. </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_4" data-id="DT19_4">And this is the case of the manslayer, that shall flee thither and live: whoso killeth his neighbor unawares, and hated him not in time past; </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_5" data-id="DT19_5">as when a man goeth into the forest with his neighbor to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbor, so that he dieth; he shall flee unto one of these cities and live: </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_6" data-id="DT19_6">lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and smite him mortally; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_7" data-id="DT19_7">Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt set apart three cities for thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_8" data-id="DT19_8">And if Jehovah thy God enlarge thy border, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers; </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_9" data-id="DT19_9">if thou shalt keep all this commandment to do it, which I command thee this day, to love Jehovah thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, besides these three:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_10" data-id="DT19_10">that innocent blood be not shed in the midst of thy land, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee. </span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_12" data-id="DT19_12">then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die. </span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_18" data-id="DT19_18">and the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and have testified falsely against his brother; </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT19_19" data-id="DT19_19">then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to do unto his brother: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee. </span>
