<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v T12_1" data-id="T12_1">I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made for all men;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T12_2" data-id="T12_2">for kings and all that are in high place; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T12_3" data-id="T12_3">This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T12_4" data-id="T12_4">who would have all men to be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T12_5" data-id="T12_5">For there is one God, one mediator also between God and men, <span class="add">himself </span> man, Christ Jesus, </span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T12_9" data-id="T12_9">In like manner, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefastness and sobriety; not with braided hair, and gold or pearls or costly raiment; </span>
