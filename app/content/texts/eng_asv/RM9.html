<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_1" data-id="RM9_1">I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_2" data-id="RM9_2">that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_3" data-id="RM9_3">For I could wish that I myself were anathema from Christ for my brethren’s sake, my kinsmen according to the flesh:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_4" data-id="RM9_4">who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service <span class="add">of God</span>, and the promises; </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_5" data-id="RM9_5">whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_6" data-id="RM9_6">But <span class="add">it is</span> not as though the word of God hath come to nought. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_7" data-id="RM9_7">neither, because they are Abraham’s seed, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_8" data-id="RM9_8">That is, it is not the children of the flesh that are children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned for a seed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_9" data-id="RM9_9">For this is a word of promise, According to this season will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_10" data-id="RM9_10">And not only so; but Rebecca also having conceived by one, <span class="add">even </span> by our father Isaac— </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_11" data-id="RM9_11">for <span class="add">the children</span> being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_12" data-id="RM9_12">it was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_13" data-id="RM9_13">Even as it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_14" data-id="RM9_14">What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_15" data-id="RM9_15">For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_16" data-id="RM9_16">So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that hath mercy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_17" data-id="RM9_17">For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, For this very purpose did I raise thee up, that I might show in thee my power, and that my name might be published abroad in all the earth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_18" data-id="RM9_18">So then he hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_19" data-id="RM9_19">Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he still find fault? For who withstandeth his will?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_20" data-id="RM9_20">Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why didst thou make me thus? </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_21" data-id="RM9_21">Or hath not the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor? </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_22" data-id="RM9_22">What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering vessels of wrath fitted unto destruction: </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_23" data-id="RM9_23">and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he afore prepared unto glory,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_24" data-id="RM9_24"> <span class="add">even</span> us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_25" data-id="RM9_25">As he saith also in Hosea,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM9_25" data-id="RM9_25">I will call that my people, which was not my people;</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM9_25" data-id="RM9_25">And her beloved, that was not beloved.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_26" data-id="RM9_26">And it shall be, <span class="add">that</span> in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM9_26" data-id="RM9_26">There shall they be called sons of the living God.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_27" data-id="RM9_27">And Isaiah crieth concerning Israel, If the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant that shall be saved: </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_28" data-id="RM9_28">for the Lord will execute <span class="add">his</span> word upon the earth, finishing it and cutting it short.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_29" data-id="RM9_29">And, as Isaiah hath said before,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM9_29" data-id="RM9_29">Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM9_29" data-id="RM9_29">We had become as Sodom, and had been made like unto Gomorrah.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_30" data-id="RM9_30">What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who followed not after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith: </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_31" data-id="RM9_31">but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, did not arrive at <span class="add">that</span> law. </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_32" data-id="RM9_32">Wherefore? Because <span class="add">they sought it</span> not by faith, but as it were by works. They stumbled at the stone of stumbling; </span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM9_33" data-id="RM9_33">even as it is written,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM9_33" data-id="RM9_33">Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM9_33" data-id="RM9_33">And he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame.</span>
