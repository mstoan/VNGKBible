<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_1" data-id="AC7_1">And the high priest said, Are these things so?</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_2" data-id="AC7_2">And he said, Brethren and fathers, hearken: The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_3" data-id="AC7_3">and said unto him, Get thee out of thy land, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_4" data-id="AC7_4">Then came he out of the land of the Chaldæans, and dwelt in Haran: and from thence, when his father was dead, <span class="add">God</span> removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell: </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_5" data-id="AC7_5">and he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: and he promised that he would give it to him in possession, and to his seed after him, when <span class="add">as yet</span> he had no child.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_6" data-id="AC7_6">And God spake on this wise, that his seed should sojourn in a strange land, and that they should bring them into bondage, and treat them ill, four hundred years. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_7" data-id="AC7_7">And the nation to which they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_8" data-id="AC7_8">And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so <span class="add">Abraham </span> begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac <span class="add">begat </span> Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_9" data-id="AC7_9">And the patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt: and God was with him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_10" data-id="AC7_10">and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_11" data-id="AC7_11">Now there came a famine over all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_12" data-id="AC7_12">But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent forth our fathers the first time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_13" data-id="AC7_13">And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph’s race became manifest unto Pharaoh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_14" data-id="AC7_14">And Joseph sent, and called to him Jacob his father, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_15" data-id="AC7_15">And Jacob went down into Egypt; and he died, himself and our fathers;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_16" data-id="AC7_16">and they were carried over unto Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver of the sons of Hamor in Shechem. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_17" data-id="AC7_17">But as the time of the promise drew nigh which God vouchsafed unto Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_18" data-id="AC7_18">till there arose another king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_19" data-id="AC7_19">The same dealt craftily with our race, and ill-treated our fathers, that they should cast out their babes to the end they might not live. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_20" data-id="AC7_20">At which season Moses was born, and was exceeding fair; and he was nourished three months in his father’s house:</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_21" data-id="AC7_21">and when he was cast out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_22" data-id="AC7_22">And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians; and he was mighty in his words and works.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_23" data-id="AC7_23">But when he was well-nigh forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_24" data-id="AC7_24">And seeing one <span class="add">of them</span> suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, smiting the Egyptian:</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_25" data-id="AC7_25">and he supposed that his brethren understood that God by his hand was giving them deliverance; but they understood not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_26" data-id="AC7_26">And the day following he appeared unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another? </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_27" data-id="AC7_27">But he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_28" data-id="AC7_28">Wouldest thou kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian yesterday?</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_29" data-id="AC7_29">And Moses fled at this saying, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_30" data-id="AC7_30">And when forty years were fulfilled, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush. </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_31" data-id="AC7_31">And when Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold, there came a voice of the Lord,</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_32" data-id="AC7_32">I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. And Moses trembled, and durst not behold.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_33" data-id="AC7_33">And the Lord said unto him, Loose the shoes from thy feet: for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_34" data-id="AC7_34">I have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and I am come down to deliver them: and now come, I will send thee into Egypt. </span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_35" data-id="AC7_35">This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? him hath God sent <span class="add">to be</span> both a ruler and a deliverer with the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_36" data-id="AC7_36">This man led them forth, having wrought wonders and signs in Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years. </span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_37" data-id="AC7_37">This is that Moses, who said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall God raise up unto you from among your brethren, like unto me. </span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_38" data-id="AC7_38">This is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel that spake to him in the mount Sinai, and with our fathers: who received living oracles to give unto us: </span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_39" data-id="AC7_39">to whom our fathers would not be obedient, but thrust him from them, and turned back in their hearts unto Egypt,</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_40" data-id="AC7_40">saying unto Aaron, Make us gods that shall go before us: for as for this Moses, who led us forth out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_41" data-id="AC7_41">And they made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their hands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_42" data-id="AC7_42">But God turned, and gave them up to serve the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC7_42" data-id="AC7_42">Did ye offer unto me slain beasts and sacrifices</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC7_42" data-id="AC7_42">Forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_43" data-id="AC7_43">And ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC7_43" data-id="AC7_43">And the star of the god Rephan,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC7_43" data-id="AC7_43">The figures which ye made to worship them:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC7_43" data-id="AC7_43">And I will carry you away beyond Babylon.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_44" data-id="AC7_44">Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, even as he appointed who spake unto Moses, that he should make it according to the figure that he had seen. </span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_45" data-id="AC7_45">Which also our fathers, in their turn, brought in with Joshua when they entered on the possession of the nations, that God thrust out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_46" data-id="AC7_46">who found favor in the sight of God, and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob.</span>

<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_48" data-id="AC7_48">Howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in <span class="add">houses</span> made with hands; as saith the prophet,</span>

<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_54" data-id="AC7_54">Now when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC7_55" data-id="AC7_55">But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, </span>
