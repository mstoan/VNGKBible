<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_1" data-id="J14_1">Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets are gone out into the world. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_2" data-id="J14_2">Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_3" data-id="J14_3">and every spirit that confesseth not Jesus is not of God: and this is the <span class="add">spirit</span> of the antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it cometh; and now it is in the world already.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_4" data-id="J14_4">Ye are of God, <span class="add">my</span> little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_5" data-id="J14_5">They are of the world: therefore speak they <span class="add">as</span> of the world, and the world heareth them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_6" data-id="J14_6">We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he who is not of God heareth us not. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_7" data-id="J14_7">Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is begotten of God, and knoweth God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_8" data-id="J14_8">He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_9" data-id="J14_9">Herein was the love of God manifested in us, that God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_10" data-id="J14_10">Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son <span class="add">to be</span> the propitiation for our sins. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_11" data-id="J14_11">Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_12" data-id="J14_12">No man hath beheld God at any time: if we love one another, God abideth in us, and his love is perfected in us:</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_13" data-id="J14_13">hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_14" data-id="J14_14">And we have beheld and bear witness that the Father hath sent the Son <span class="add">to be</span> the Saviour of the world. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_15" data-id="J14_15">Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_16" data-id="J14_16">And we know and have believed the love which God hath in us. God is love; and he that abideth in love abideth in God, and God abideth in him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_17" data-id="J14_17">Herein is love made perfect with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as he is, even so are we in this world. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_18" data-id="J14_18">There is no fear in love: but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath punishment; and he that feareth is not made perfect in love. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_19" data-id="J14_19">We love, because he first loved us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_20" data-id="J14_20">If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, cannot love God whom he hath not seen. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v J14_21" data-id="J14_21">And this commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God love his brother also.</span>
