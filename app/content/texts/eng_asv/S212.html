<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_1" data-id="S212_1">And Jehovah sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_2" data-id="S212_2">The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_3" data-id="S212_3">but the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own morsel, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_4" data-id="S212_4">And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him, but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_5" data-id="S212_5">And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As Jehovah liveth, the man that hath done this is worthy to die: </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_6" data-id="S212_6">and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_7" data-id="S212_7">And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul; </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_8" data-id="S212_8">and I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy master’s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would have added unto thee such and such things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_9" data-id="S212_9">Wherefore hast thou despised the word of Jehovah, to do that which is evil in his sight? thou hast smitten Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_10" data-id="S212_10">Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house, because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_11" data-id="S212_11">Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house; and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_12" data-id="S212_12">For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_13" data-id="S212_13">And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against Jehovah. And Nathan said unto David, Jehovah also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_14" data-id="S212_14">Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of Jehovah to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_15" data-id="S212_15">And Nathan departed unto his house.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v S212_15" data-id="S212_15">And Jehovah struck the child that Uriah’s wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_16" data-id="S212_16">David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_17" data-id="S212_17">And the elders of his house arose, <span class="add">and stood</span> beside him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_18" data-id="S212_18">And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he hearkened not unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead!</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_19" data-id="S212_19">But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_20" data-id="S212_20">Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel; and he came into the house of Jehovah, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_21" data-id="S212_21">Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_22" data-id="S212_22">And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who knoweth whether Jehovah will not be gracious to me, that the child may live? </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_23" data-id="S212_23">But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_24" data-id="S212_24">And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon. And Jehovah loved him; </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_25" data-id="S212_25">and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, for Jehovah’s sake.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_26" data-id="S212_26">Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_27" data-id="S212_27">And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah; yea, I have taken the city of waters.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_28" data-id="S212_28">Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called after my name. </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_29" data-id="S212_29">And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_30" data-id="S212_30">And he took the crown of their king from off his head; and the weight thereof was a talent of gold, and <span class="add">in it were</span> precious stones; and it was set on David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much. </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v S212_31" data-id="S212_31">And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem. </span>
