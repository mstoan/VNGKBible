<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_1" data-id="S27_1">And it came to pass, when the king dwelt in his house, and Jehovah had given him rest from all his enemies round about,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_2" data-id="S27_2">that the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_3" data-id="S27_3">And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thy heart; for Jehovah is with thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_4" data-id="S27_4">And it came to pass the same night, that the word of Jehovah came unto Nathan, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_5" data-id="S27_5">Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah, Shalt thou build me a house for me to dwell in?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_6" data-id="S27_6">for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_7" data-id="S27_7">In all places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel, spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_8" data-id="S27_8">Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people, over Israel;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_9" data-id="S27_9">and I have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a great name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_10" data-id="S27_10">And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_11" data-id="S27_11">and <span class="add">as</span> from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will cause thee to rest from all thine enemies. Moreover Jehovah telleth thee that Jehovah will make thee a house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_12" data-id="S27_12">When thy days are fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, that shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_13" data-id="S27_13">He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_14" data-id="S27_14">I will be his father, and he shall be my son: if he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men; </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_15" data-id="S27_15">but my lovingkindness shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_16" data-id="S27_16">And thy house and thy kingdom shall be made sure for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_17" data-id="S27_17">According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_18" data-id="S27_18">Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Lord Jehovah, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far? </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_19" data-id="S27_19">And this was yet a small thing in thine eyes, O Lord Jehovah; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant’s house for a great while to come; and this <span class="add">too</span> after the manner of men, O Lord Jehovah!</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_20" data-id="S27_20">And what can David say more unto thee? for thou knowest thy servant, O Lord Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_21" data-id="S27_21">For thy word’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make thy servant know it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_22" data-id="S27_22">Wherefore thou art great, O Jehovah God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_23" data-id="S27_23">And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, and to make him a name, and to do great things for you, and terrible things for thy land, before thy people, whom thou redeemest to thee out of Egypt, <span class="add">from</span> the nations and their gods?</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_24" data-id="S27_24">And thou didst establish to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever; and thou, Jehovah, becamest their God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_25" data-id="S27_25">And now, O Jehovah God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, confirm thou it for ever, and do as thou hast spoken. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_26" data-id="S27_26">And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is God over Israel; and the house of thy servant David shall be established before thee. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_27" data-id="S27_27">For thou, O Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_28" data-id="S27_28">And now, O Lord Jehovah, thou art God, and thy words are truth, and thou hast promised this good thing unto thy servant:</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v S27_29" data-id="S27_29">now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee; for thou, O Lord Jehovah, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.</span>
