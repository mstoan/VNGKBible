<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_1" data-id="AC15_1">And certain men came down from Jud√¶a and taught the brethren, <span class="add">saying</span>, Except ye be circumcised after the custom of Moses, ye cannot be saved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_2" data-id="AC15_2">And when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and questioning with them, <span class="add">the brethren</span> appointed that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_3" data-id="AC15_3">They therefore, being brought on their way by the church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_4" data-id="AC15_4">And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church and the apostles and the elders, and they rehearsed all things that God had done with them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_5" data-id="AC15_5">But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees who believed, saying, It is needful to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the law of Moses. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_6" data-id="AC15_6">And the apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider of this matter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_7" data-id="AC15_7">And when there had been much questioning, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Brethren, ye know that a good while ago God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_8" data-id="AC15_8">And God, who knoweth the heart, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as he did unto us;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_9" data-id="AC15_9">and he made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_10" data-id="AC15_10">Now therefore why make ye trial of God, that ye should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_11" data-id="AC15_11">But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in like manner as they.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_12" data-id="AC15_12">And all the multitude kept silence; and they hearkened unto Barnabas and Paul rehearsing what signs and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles through them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_13" data-id="AC15_13">And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Brethren, hearken unto me:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_14" data-id="AC15_14">Symeon hath rehearsed how first God visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_15" data-id="AC15_15">And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_16" data-id="AC15_16">After these things I will return,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC15_16" data-id="AC15_16">And I will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen;</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC15_16" data-id="AC15_16">And I will build again the ruins thereof,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC15_16" data-id="AC15_16">And I will set it up:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_17" data-id="AC15_17">That the residue of men may seek after the Lord,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC15_17" data-id="AC15_17">And all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_18" data-id="AC15_18">Saith the Lord, who maketh these things known from of old.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_19" data-id="AC15_19">Wherefore my judgment is, that we trouble not them that from among the Gentiles turn to God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_20" data-id="AC15_20">but that we write unto them, that they abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_21" data-id="AC15_21">For Moses from generations of old hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_22" data-id="AC15_22">Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men out of their company, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; <span class="add">namely</span>, Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_23" data-id="AC15_23">and they wrote <span class="add">thus</span> by them, The apostles and the elders, brethren, unto the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting: </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_24" data-id="AC15_24">Forasmuch as we have heard that certain who went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls; to whom we gave no commandment; </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_25" data-id="AC15_25">it seemed good unto us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_26" data-id="AC15_26">men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_27" data-id="AC15_27">We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also shall tell you the same things by word of mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_28" data-id="AC15_28">For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_29" data-id="AC15_29">that ye abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep yourselves, it shall be well with you. Fare ye well.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_30" data-id="AC15_30">So they, when they were dismissed, came down to Antioch; and having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle. </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_31" data-id="AC15_31">And when they had read it, they rejoiced for the consolation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_32" data-id="AC15_32">And Judas and Silas, being themselves also prophets, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_33" data-id="AC15_33">And after they had spent some time <span class="add">there</span>, they were dismissed in peace from the brethren unto those that had sent them forth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_34" data-id="AC15_34"> <span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">+</a></span><span class="note" id="note-3"><a class="key" href="#footnote-3">But</a></span> </span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_35" data-id="AC15_35">But Paul and Barnabas tarried in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_36" data-id="AC15_36">And after some days Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us return now and visit the brethren in every city wherein we proclaimed the word of the Lord, <span class="add">and see</span> how they fare. </span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_37" data-id="AC15_37">And Barnabas was minded to take with them John also, who was called Mark.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_38" data-id="AC15_38">But Paul thought not good to take with them him who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work. </span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_39" data-id="AC15_39">And there arose a sharp contention, so that they parted asunder one from the other, and Barnabas took Mark with him, and sailed away unto Cyprus: </span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_40" data-id="AC15_40">but Paul chose Silas, and went forth, being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_41" data-id="AC15_41">And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.</span>
