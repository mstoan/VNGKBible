<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_1" data-id="LK9_1">And he called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_2" data-id="LK9_2">And he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_3" data-id="LK9_3">And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_4" data-id="LK9_4">And into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide, and thence depart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_5" data-id="LK9_5">And as many as receive you not, when ye depart from that city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_6" data-id="LK9_6">And they departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the gospel, and healing everywhere.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_7" data-id="LK9_7">Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done: and he was much perplexed, because that it was said by some, that John was risen from the dead; </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_8" data-id="LK9_8">and by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_9" data-id="LK9_9">And Herod said, John I beheaded: but who is this, about whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_10" data-id="LK9_10">And the apostles, when they were returned, declared unto him what things they had done. And he took them, and withdrew apart to a city called Bethsaida. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_11" data-id="LK9_11">But the multitudes perceiving it followed him: and he welcomed them, and spake to them of the kingdom of God, and them that had need of healing he cured. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_12" data-id="LK9_12">And the day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages and country round about, and lodge, and get provisions: for we are here in a desert place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_13" data-id="LK9_13">But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy food for all this people. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_14" data-id="LK9_14">For they were about five thousand men. And he said unto his disciples, Make them sit down in companies, about fifty each.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_15" data-id="LK9_15">And they did so, and made them all sit down.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_16" data-id="LK9_16">And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake; and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_17" data-id="LK9_17">And they ate, and were all filled: and there was taken up that which remained over to them of broken pieces, twelve baskets. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_18" data-id="LK9_18">And it came to pass, as he was praying apart, the disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Who do the multitudes say that I am? </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_19" data-id="LK9_19">And they answering said, John the Baptist; but others <span class="add">say</span>, Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_20" data-id="LK9_20">And he said unto them, But who say ye that I am? And Peter answering said, The Christ of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_21" data-id="LK9_21">But he charged them, and commanded <span class="add">them</span> to tell this to no man;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_22" data-id="LK9_22">saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_23" data-id="LK9_23">And he said unto all, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_24" data-id="LK9_24">For whosoever would save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_25" data-id="LK9_25">For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose or forfeit his own self?</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_26" data-id="LK9_26">For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in his own glory, and <span class="add">the glory </span> of the Father, and of the holy angels.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_27" data-id="LK9_27">But I tell you of a truth, There are some of them that stand here, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_28" data-id="LK9_28">And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray. </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_29" data-id="LK9_29">And as he was praying, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment <span class="add">became</span> white <span class="add">and</span> dazzling. </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_30" data-id="LK9_30">And behold, there talked with him two men, who were Moses and Elijah;</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_31" data-id="LK9_31">who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_32" data-id="LK9_32">Now Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_33" data-id="LK9_33">And it came to pass, as they were parting from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: not knowing what he said.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_34" data-id="LK9_34">And while he said these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud. </span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_35" data-id="LK9_35">And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my Son, my chosen: hear ye him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_36" data-id="LK9_36">And when the voice came, Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no man in those days any of the things which they had seen. </span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_37" data-id="LK9_37">And it came to pass, on the next day, when they were come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_38" data-id="LK9_38">And behold, a man from the multitude cried, saying, Teacher, I beseech thee to look upon my son; for he is mine only child: </span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_39" data-id="LK9_39">and behold, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth, and it hardly departeth from him, bruising him sorely. </span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_40" data-id="LK9_40">And I besought thy disciples to cast it out; and they could not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_41" data-id="LK9_41">And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? bring hither thy son. </span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_42" data-id="LK9_42">And as he was yet a coming, the demon dashed him down, and tare <span class="add">him</span> grievously. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_43" data-id="LK9_43">And they were all astonished at the majesty of God. But while all were marvelling at all the things which he did, he said unto his disciples, </span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_44" data-id="LK9_44">Let these words sink into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_45" data-id="LK9_45">But they understood not this saying, and it was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying. </span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_46" data-id="LK9_46">And there arose a reasoning among them, which of them was the greatest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_47" data-id="LK9_47">But when Jesus saw the reasoning of their heart, he took a little child, and set him by his side,</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_48" data-id="LK9_48">and said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same is great.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_49" data-id="LK9_49">And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followeth not with us. </span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_50" data-id="LK9_50">But Jesus said unto him, Forbid <span class="add">him</span> not: for he that is not against you is for you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_51" data-id="LK9_51">And it came to pass, when the days were well-nigh come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, </span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_52" data-id="LK9_52">and sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_53" data-id="LK9_53">And they did not receive him, because his face was <span class="add">as though he were</span> going to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_54" data-id="LK9_54">And when his disciples James and John saw <span class="add">this</span>, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we bid fire to come down from heaven, and consume them? </span>
<span class="v-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_55" data-id="LK9_55">But he turned, and rebuked them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_56" data-id="LK9_56">And they went to another village.</span>
<span class="v-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_57" data-id="LK9_57">And as they went on the way, a certain man said unto him, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_58" data-id="LK9_58">And Jesus said unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven <span class="add">have</span> nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</span>
<span class="v-num v-59">59&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_59" data-id="LK9_59">And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-60">60&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_60" data-id="LK9_60">But he said unto him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead; but go thou and publish abroad the kingdom of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-61">61&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_61" data-id="LK9_61">And another also said, I will follow thee, Lord; but first suffer me to bid farewell to them that are at my house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-62">62&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK9_62" data-id="LK9_62">But Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</span>
