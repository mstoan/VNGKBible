<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_1" data-id="LK16_1">And he said also unto the disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he was wasting his goods. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_2" data-id="LK16_2">And he called him, and said unto him, What is this that I hear of thee? render the account of thy stewardship; for thou canst be no longer steward. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_3" data-id="LK16_3">And the steward said within himself, What shall I do, seeing that my lord taketh away the stewardship from me? I have not strength to dig; to beg I am ashamed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_4" data-id="LK16_4">I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_5" data-id="LK16_5">And calling to him each one of his lord’s debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_6" data-id="LK16_6">And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bond, and sit down quickly and write fifty.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_7" data-id="LK16_7">Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He saith unto him, Take thy bond, and write fourscore. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_8" data-id="LK16_8">And his lord commended the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely: for the sons of this world are for their own generation wiser than the sons of the light. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_9" data-id="LK16_9">And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_10" data-id="LK16_10">He that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much: and he that is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_11" data-id="LK16_11">If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true <span class="add">riches</span>? </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_12" data-id="LK16_12">And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give you that which is your own?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_13" data-id="LK16_13">No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_14" data-id="LK16_14">And the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things; and they scoffed at him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_15" data-id="LK16_15">And he said unto them, Ye are they that justify yourselves in the sight of men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_16" data-id="LK16_16">The law and the prophets <span class="add">were</span> until John: from that time the gospel of the kingdom of God is preached, and every man entereth violently into it. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_17" data-id="LK16_17">But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the law to fall.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_18" data-id="LK16_18">Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth one that is put away from a husband committeth adultery. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_19" data-id="LK16_19">Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, faring sumptuously every day:</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_20" data-id="LK16_20">and a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_21" data-id="LK16_21">and desiring to be fed with the <span class="add">crumbs</span> that fell from the rich man’s table; yea, even the dogs came and licked his sores. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_22" data-id="LK16_22">And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: and the rich man also died, and was buried. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_23" data-id="LK16_23">And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_24" data-id="LK16_24">And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_25" data-id="LK16_25">But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things: but now here he is comforted, and thou art in anguish. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_26" data-id="LK16_26">And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that they that would pass from hence to you may not be able, and that none may cross over from thence to us. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_27" data-id="LK16_27">And he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_28" data-id="LK16_28">for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_29" data-id="LK16_29">But Abraham saith, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_30" data-id="LK16_30">And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one go to them from the dead, they will repent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK16_31" data-id="LK16_31">And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, if one rise from the dead.</span>
