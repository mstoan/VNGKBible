<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS34_5" data-id="IS34_5">For my sword hath drunk its fill in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS34_6" data-id="IS34_6">The sword of Jehovah is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams; for Jehovah hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS34_7" data-id="IS34_7">And the wild-oxen shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls: and their land shall be drunken with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS34_8" data-id="IS34_8">For Jehovah hath a day of vengeance, a year of recompense for the cause of Zion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS34_9" data-id="IS34_9">And the streams of <span class="add">Edom</span> shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS34_10" data-id="IS34_10">It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever; from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS34_11" data-id="IS34_11">But the pelican and the porcupine shall possess it; and the owl and the raven shall dwell therein: and he will stretch over it the line of confusion, and the plummet of emptiness. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS34_12" data-id="IS34_12">They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none shall be there; and all its princes shall be nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS34_13" data-id="IS34_13">And thorns shall come up in its palaces, nettles and thistles in the fortresses thereof; and it shall be a habitation of jackals, a court for ostriches. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS34_14" data-id="IS34_14">And the wild beasts of the desert shall meet with the wolves, and the wild goat shall cry to his fellow; yea, the night-monster shall settle there, and shall find her a place of rest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS34_15" data-id="IS34_15">There shall the dart-snake make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shade; yea, there shall the kites be gathered, every one with her mate. </span>
