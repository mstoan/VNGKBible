<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC10_2" data-id="ZC10_2">For the teraphim have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie; and they have told false dreams, they comfort in vain: therefore they go their way like sheep, they are afflicted, because there is no shepherd.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC10_3" data-id="ZC10_3">Mine anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the he-goats; for Jehovah of hosts hath visited his flock, the house of Judah, and will make them as his goodly horse in the battle.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC10_4" data-id="ZC10_4">From him shall come forth the corner-stone, from him the nail, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler together.</span>

<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC10_6" data-id="ZC10_6">And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them back; for I have mercy upon them; and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am Jehovah their God, and I will hear them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC10_7" data-id="ZC10_7">And <span class="add">they of</span> Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine; yea, their children shall see it, and rejoice; their heart shall be glad in Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC10_8" data-id="ZC10_8">I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them; and they shall increase as they have increased.</span>
