<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR31_33" data-id="JR31_33">But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith Jehovah: I will put my law in their inward parts, and in their heart will I write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people:</span>
