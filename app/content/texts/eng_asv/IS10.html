<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS10_7" data-id="IS10_7">Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS10_8" data-id="IS10_8">For he saith, Are not my princes all of them kings?</span>

<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS10_26" data-id="IS10_26">And Jehovah of hosts will stir up against him a scourge, as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and his rod will be over the sea, and he will lift it up after the manner of Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS10_27" data-id="IS10_27">And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall depart from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed by reason of fatness. </span>
