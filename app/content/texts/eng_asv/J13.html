<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_1" data-id="J13_1">Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God; and <span class="add">such</span> we are. For this cause the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_2" data-id="J13_2">Beloved, now are we children of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be. We know that, if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him even as he is.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_3" data-id="J13_3">And every one that hath this hope <span class="add">set</span> on him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_4" data-id="J13_4">Every one that doeth sin doeth also lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_5" data-id="J13_5">And ye know that he was manifested to take away sins; and in him is no sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_6" data-id="J13_6">Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither knoweth him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_7" data-id="J13_7"> <span class="add">My</span> little children, let no man lead you astray: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous: </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_8" data-id="J13_8">he that doeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. To this end was the Son of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_9" data-id="J13_9">Whosoever is begotten of God doeth no sin, because his seed abideth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is begotten of God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_10" data-id="J13_10">In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_11" data-id="J13_11">For this is the message which ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another:</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_12" data-id="J13_12">not as Cain was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his works were evil, and his brother’s righteous. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_13" data-id="J13_13">Marvel not, brethren, if the world hateth you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_14" data-id="J13_14">We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_15" data-id="J13_15">Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_16" data-id="J13_16">Hereby know we love, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_22" data-id="J13_22">and whatsoever we ask we receive of him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_23" data-id="J13_23">And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he gave us commandment. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v J13_24" data-id="J13_24">And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he gave us. </span>
