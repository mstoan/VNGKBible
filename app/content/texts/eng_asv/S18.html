<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S18_2" data-id="S18_2">Now the name of his first-born was Joel; and the name of his second, Abijah: they were judges in Beer-sheba.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S18_3" data-id="S18_3">And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted justice.</span>

<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S18_4" data-id="S18_4">Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S18_5" data-id="S18_5">and they said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S18_6" data-id="S18_6">But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S18_7" data-id="S18_7">And Jehovah said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not be king over them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S18_8" data-id="S18_8">According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S18_9" data-id="S18_9">Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit thou shalt protest solemnly unto them, and shalt show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them. </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S18_10" data-id="S18_10">And Samuel told all the words of Jehovah unto the people that asked of him a king.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S18_11" data-id="S18_11">And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them unto him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v S18_12" data-id="S18_12">and he will appoint them unto him for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and <span class="add">he will set some</span> to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S18_13" data-id="S18_13">And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S18_14" data-id="S18_14">And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v S18_15" data-id="S18_15">And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v S18_16" data-id="S18_16">And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S18_17" data-id="S18_17">He will take the tenth of your flocks: and ye shall be his servants.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v S18_18" data-id="S18_18">And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king whom ye shall have chosen you; and Jehovah will not answer you in that day. </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v S18_19" data-id="S18_19">But the people refused to hearken unto the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay: but we will have a king over us,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v S18_20" data-id="S18_20">that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v S18_21" data-id="S18_21">And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v S18_22" data-id="S18_22">And Jehovah said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city. </span>
