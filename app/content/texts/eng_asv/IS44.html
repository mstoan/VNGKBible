<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_2" data-id="IS44_2">Thus saith Jehovah that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, who will help thee: Fear not, O Jacob my servant; and thou, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_3" data-id="IS44_3">For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and streams upon the dry ground; I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring: </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_4" data-id="IS44_4">and they shall spring up among the grass, as willows by the watercourses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_5" data-id="IS44_5">One shall say, I am Jehovah’s; and another shall call <span class="add">himself </span> by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto Jehovah, and surname <span class="add">himself</span> by the name of Israel. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_6" data-id="IS44_6">Thus saith Jehovah, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts: I am the first, and I am the last; and besides me there is no God. </span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_8" data-id="IS44_8">Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have I not declared unto thee of old, and showed it? and ye are my witnesses. Is there a God besides me? yea, there is no Rock; I know not any. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_9" data-id="IS44_9">They that fashion a graven image are all of them vanity; and the things that they delight in shall not profit; and their own witnesses see not, nor know: that they may be put to shame. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_10" data-id="IS44_10">Who hath fashioned a god, or molten an image that is profitable for nothing?</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_15" data-id="IS44_15">Then shall it be for a man to burn; and he taketh thereof, and warmeth himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread: yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_16" data-id="IS44_16">He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied; yea, he warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_17" data-id="IS44_17">And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image; he falleth down unto it and worshippeth, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_18" data-id="IS44_18">They know not, neither do they consider: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_19" data-id="IS44_19">And none calleth to mind, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree? </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_20" data-id="IS44_20">He feedeth on ashes; a deceived heart hath turned him aside; and he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand? </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_21" data-id="IS44_21">Remember these things, O Jacob, and Israel; for thou art my servant: I have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_22" data-id="IS44_22">I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_23" data-id="IS44_23">Sing, O ye heavens, for Jehovah hath done it; shout, ye lower parts of the earth; break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob, and will glorify himself in Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_24" data-id="IS44_24">Thus saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb: I am Jehovah, that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth (who is with me?);</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_25" data-id="IS44_25">that frustrateth the signs of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish; </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_26" data-id="IS44_26">that confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith of Jerusalem, She shall be inhabited; and of the cities of Judah, They shall be built, and I will raise up the waste places thereof;</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS44_27" data-id="IS44_27">that saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers;</span>
