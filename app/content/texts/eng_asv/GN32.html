<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_1" data-id="GN32_1">And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_2" data-id="GN32_2">And Jacob said when he saw them, This is God’s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_3" data-id="GN32_3">And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_4" data-id="GN32_4">And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now: </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_5" data-id="GN32_5">and I have oxen, and asses, <span class="add">and</span> flocks, and men-servants, and maid-servants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in thy sight. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_6" data-id="GN32_6">And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_7" data-id="GN32_7">Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies; </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_8" data-id="GN32_8">and he said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the company which is left shall escape.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_9" data-id="GN32_9">And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, who saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good: </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_10" data-id="GN32_10">I am not worthy of the least of all the lovingkindnesses, and of all the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two companies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_11" data-id="GN32_11">Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_12" data-id="GN32_12">And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_13" data-id="GN32_13">And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_14" data-id="GN32_14">two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_15" data-id="GN32_15">thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_16" data-id="GN32_16">And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_17" data-id="GN32_17">And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_18" data-id="GN32_18">then thou shalt say, <span class="add">They are</span> thy servant Jacob’s; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, he also is behind us. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_19" data-id="GN32_19">And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him; </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_20" data-id="GN32_20">and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_21" data-id="GN32_21">So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_22" data-id="GN32_22">And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_23" data-id="GN32_23">And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_24" data-id="GN32_24">And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_25" data-id="GN32_25">And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_26" data-id="GN32_26">And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_27" data-id="GN32_27">And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_28" data-id="GN32_28">And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_29" data-id="GN32_29">And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there. </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_30" data-id="GN32_30">And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, <span class="add">said he</span>, I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_31" data-id="GN32_31">And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he limped upon his thigh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN32_32" data-id="GN32_32">Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew of the hip.</span>
