<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV5_7" data-id="LV5_7">And if his means suffice not for a lamb, then he shall bring his trespass-offering for that wherein he hath sinned, two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, unto Jehovah; one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV5_8" data-id="LV5_8">And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin-offering first, and wring off its head from its neck, but shall not divide it asunder: </span>
