<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH2_1" data-id="JH2_1">Then Jonah prayed unto Jehovah his God out of the fishâ€™s belly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH2_2" data-id="JH2_2">And he said, I called by reason of mine affliction unto Jehovah, And he answered me; Out of the belly of Sheol cried I, <span class="add">And</span> thou heardest my voice. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH2_3" data-id="JH2_3">For thou didst cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas, And the flood was round about me; All thy waves and thy billows passed over me. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH2_4" data-id="JH2_4">And I said, I am cast out from before thine eyes; Yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH2_5" data-id="JH2_5">The waters compassed me about, even to the soul; The deep was round about me; The weeds were wrapped about my head.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH2_6" data-id="JH2_6">I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; The earth with its bars <span class="add">closed</span> upon me for ever: Yet hast thou brought up my life from the pit, O Jehovah my God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH2_7" data-id="JH2_7">When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Jehovah; And my prayer came in unto thee, into thy holy temple.</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JH2_9" data-id="JH2_9">But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation is of Jehovah. </span>
