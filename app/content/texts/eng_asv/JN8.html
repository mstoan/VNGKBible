<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_1" data-id="JN8_1">but Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_2" data-id="JN8_2">And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_3" data-id="JN8_3">And the scribes and the Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_4" data-id="JN8_4">they say unto him, Teacher, this woman hath been taken in adultery, in the very act.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_5" data-id="JN8_5">Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such: what then sayest thou of her?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_6" data-id="JN8_6">And this they said, trying him, that they might have <span class="add">whereof </span> to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_7" data-id="JN8_7">But when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_8" data-id="JN8_8">And again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_9" data-id="JN8_9">And they, when they heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest, <span class="add">even</span> unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_10" data-id="JN8_10">And Jesus lifted up himself, and said unto her, Woman, where are they? did no man condemn thee?</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_11" data-id="JN8_11">And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn thee: go thy way; from henceforth sin no more.]</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_12" data-id="JN8_12">Again therefore Jesus spake unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_13" data-id="JN8_13">The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_14" data-id="JN8_14">Jesus answered and said unto them, Even if I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye know not whence I come, or whither I go. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_15" data-id="JN8_15">Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_16" data-id="JN8_16">Yea and if I judge, my judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_17" data-id="JN8_17">Yea and in your law it is written, that the witness of two men is true.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_18" data-id="JN8_18">I am he that beareth witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_19" data-id="JN8_19">They said therefore unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me, nor my Father: if ye knew me, ye would know my Father also. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_20" data-id="JN8_20">These words spake he in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man took him; because his hour was not yet come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_21" data-id="JN8_21">He said therefore again unto them, I go away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: whither I go, ye cannot come. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_22" data-id="JN8_22">The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come?</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_23" data-id="JN8_23">And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_24" data-id="JN8_24">I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am <span class="add">he</span>, ye shall die in your sins. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_25" data-id="JN8_25">They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? Jesus said unto them, Even that which I have also spoken unto you from the beginning. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_26" data-id="JN8_26">I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these speak I unto the world. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_27" data-id="JN8_27">They perceived not that he spake to them of the Father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_28" data-id="JN8_28">Jesus therefore said, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am <span class="add">he</span>, and <span class="add">that</span> I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_29" data-id="JN8_29">And he that sent me is with me; he hath not left me alone; for I do always the things that are pleasing to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_30" data-id="JN8_30">As he spake these things, many believed on him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_31" data-id="JN8_31">Jesus therefore said to those Jews that had believed him, If ye abide in my word, <span class="add">then</span> are ye truly my disciples; </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_32" data-id="JN8_32">and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_33" data-id="JN8_33">They answered unto him, We are Abraham’s seed, and have never yet been in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? </span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_34" data-id="JN8_34">Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_35" data-id="JN8_35">And the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever: the son abideth for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_36" data-id="JN8_36">If therefore the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_37" data-id="JN8_37">I know that ye are Abraham’s seed, yet ye seek to kill me, because my word hath not free course in you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_38" data-id="JN8_38">I speak the things which I have seen with <span class="add">my</span> Father: and ye also do the things which ye heard from <span class="add">your</span> father. </span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_39" data-id="JN8_39">They answered and said unto him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham. </span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_40" data-id="JN8_40">But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_41" data-id="JN8_41">Ye do the works of your father. They said unto him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, <span class="add">even</span> God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_42" data-id="JN8_42">Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I came forth and am come from God; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me. </span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_43" data-id="JN8_43">Why do ye not understand my speech? <span class="add">Even</span> because ye cannot hear my word.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_44" data-id="JN8_44">Ye are of <span class="add">your</span> father the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and standeth not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof. </span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_45" data-id="JN8_45">But because I say the truth, ye believe me not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_46" data-id="JN8_46">Which of you convicteth me of sin? If I say truth, why do ye not believe me?</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_47" data-id="JN8_47">He that is of God heareth the words of God: for this cause ye hear <span class="add">them</span> not, because ye are not of God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_48" data-id="JN8_48">The Jews answered and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_49" data-id="JN8_49">Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_50" data-id="JN8_50">But I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_51" data-id="JN8_51">Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my word, he shall never see death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_52" data-id="JN8_52">The Jews said unto him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste of death. </span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_53" data-id="JN8_53">Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who died? and the prophets died: whom makest thou thyself?</span>
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_54" data-id="JN8_54">Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God; </span>
<span class="v-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_55" data-id="JN8_55">and ye have not known him: but I know him; and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be like unto you, a liar: but I know him, and keep his word. </span>
<span class="v-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_56" data-id="JN8_56">Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.</span>
<span class="v-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_57" data-id="JN8_57">The Jews therefore said unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</span>
<span class="v-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_58" data-id="JN8_58">Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was born, I am.</span>
<span class="v-num v-59">59&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN8_59" data-id="JN8_59">They took up stones therefore to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.</span>
