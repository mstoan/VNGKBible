<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS37_27" data-id="IS37_27">Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as a field <span class="add">of grain</span> before it is grown up. </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS37_28" data-id="IS37_28">But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS37_29" data-id="IS37_29">Because of thy raging against me, and because thine arrogancy is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS37_30" data-id="IS37_30">And this shall be the sign unto thee: ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.</span>
