<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_1" data-id="C19_1">Am I not free? am I not an apostle? have I not seen Jesus our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_2" data-id="C19_2">If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_3" data-id="C19_3">My defence to them that examine me is this.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_4" data-id="C19_4">Have we no right to eat and to drink?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_5" data-id="C19_5">Have we no right to lead about a wife that is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_6" data-id="C19_6">Or I only and Barnabas, have we not a right to forbear working?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_7" data-id="C19_7">What soldier ever serveth at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_8" data-id="C19_8">Do I speak these things after the manner of men? or saith not the law also the same?</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_9" data-id="C19_9">For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. Is it for the oxen that God careth, </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_10" data-id="C19_10">or saith he it assuredly for our sake? Yea, for our sake it was written: because he that ploweth ought to plow in hope, and he that thresheth, <span class="add">to thresh</span> in hope of partaking.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_11" data-id="C19_11">If we sowed unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_12" data-id="C19_12">If others partake of <span class="add">this</span> right over you, do not we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right; but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_13" data-id="C19_13">Know ye not that they that minister about sacred things eat <span class="add">of </span> the things of the temple, <span class="add">and</span> they that wait upon the altar have their portion with the altar?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_14" data-id="C19_14">Even so did the Lord ordain that they that proclaim the gospel should live of the gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_15" data-id="C19_15">But I have used none of these things: and I write not these things that it may be so done in my case; for <span class="add">it were</span> good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_16" data-id="C19_16">For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid upon me; for woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_17" data-id="C19_17">For if I do this of mine own will, I have a reward: but if not of mine own will, I have a stewardship intrusted to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_18" data-id="C19_18">What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_19" data-id="C19_19">For though I was free from all <span class="add">men,</span> I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_20" data-id="C19_20">And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_21" data-id="C19_21">to them that are without law, as without law, not being without law to God, but under law to Christ, that I might gain them that are without law. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_22" data-id="C19_22">To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I am become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_23" data-id="C19_23">And I do all things for the gospelâ€™s sake, that I may be a joint partaker thereof.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_24" data-id="C19_24">Know ye not that they that run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? Even so run; that ye may attain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_25" data-id="C19_25">And every man that striveth in the games exerciseth self-control in all things. Now they <span class="add">do it</span> to receive a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_26" data-id="C19_26">I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so fight I, as not beating the air:</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C19_27" data-id="C19_27">but I buffet my body, and bring it into bondage: lest by any means, after that I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected. </span>
