<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_1" data-id="ER4_1">Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple unto Jehovah, the God of Israel; </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_2" data-id="ER4_2">then they drew near to Zerubbabel, and to the heads of fathers’ <span class="add">houses</span>, and said unto them, Let us build with you; for we seek your God, as ye do; and we sacrifice unto him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assyria, who brought us up hither.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_3" data-id="ER4_3">But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers’ <span class="add">houses</span> of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us in building a house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_4" data-id="ER4_4">Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_5" data-id="ER4_5">and hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_6" data-id="ER4_6">And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem. </span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_8" data-id="ER4_8">Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:</span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_13" data-id="ER4_13">Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and in the end it will be hurtful unto the kings. </span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_15" data-id="ER4_15">that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time; for which cause was this city laid waste. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_16" data-id="ER4_16">We certify the king that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, by this means thou shalt have no portion beyond the River. </span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_18" data-id="ER4_18">The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_19" data-id="ER4_19">And I decreed, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_20" data-id="ER4_20">There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all <span class="add">the country</span> beyond the River; and tribute, custom, and toll, was paid unto them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER4_21" data-id="ER4_21">Make ye now a decree to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until a decree shall be made by me.</span>
