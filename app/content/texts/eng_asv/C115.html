<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_1" data-id="C115_1">Now I make known unto you brethren, the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye received, wherein also ye stand,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_2" data-id="C115_2">by which also ye are saved, if ye hold fast the word which I preached unto you, except ye believed in vain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_3" data-id="C115_3">For I delivered unto you first of all that which also I received: that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_4" data-id="C115_4">and that he was buried; and that he hath been raised on the third day according to the scriptures;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_5" data-id="C115_5">and that he appeared to Cephas; then to the twelve;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_6" data-id="C115_6">then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until now, but some are fallen asleep; </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_7" data-id="C115_7">then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_8" data-id="C115_8">and last of all, as to the <span class="add">child</span> untimely born, he appeared to me also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_9" data-id="C115_9">For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_10" data-id="C115_10">But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_11" data-id="C115_11">Whether then <span class="add">it be</span> I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_12" data-id="C115_12">Now if Christ is preached that he hath been raised from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_13" data-id="C115_13">But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither hath Christ been raised:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_14" data-id="C115_14">and if Christ hath not been raised, then is our preaching vain, your faith also is vain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_15" data-id="C115_15">Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we witnessed of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead are not raised. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_16" data-id="C115_16">For if the dead are not raised, neither hath Christ been raised:</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_17" data-id="C115_17">and if Christ hath not been raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_18" data-id="C115_18">Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_19" data-id="C115_19">If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_20" data-id="C115_20">But now hath Christ been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of them that are asleep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_21" data-id="C115_21">For since by man <span class="add">came</span> death, by man <span class="add">came</span> also the resurrection of the dead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_22" data-id="C115_22">For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_23" data-id="C115_23">But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; then they that are Christ’s, at his coming.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_24" data-id="C115_24">Then <span class="add">cometh</span> the end, when he shall deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have abolished all rule and all authority and power. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_25" data-id="C115_25">For he must reign, till he hath put all his enemies under his feet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_26" data-id="C115_26">The last enemy that shall be abolished is death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_27" data-id="C115_27">For, He put all things in subjection under his feet. But when he saith, All things are put in subjection, it is evident that he is excepted who did subject all things unto him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_28" data-id="C115_28">And when all things have been subjected unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subjected to him that did subject all things unto him, that God may be all in all. </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_29" data-id="C115_29">Else what shall they do that are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them? </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_30" data-id="C115_30">Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_31" data-id="C115_31">I protest by that glorying in you, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_32" data-id="C115_32">If after the manner of men I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die. </span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_33" data-id="C115_33">Be not deceived: Evil companionships corrupt good morals.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_34" data-id="C115_34">Awake to soberness righteously, and sin not; for some have no knowledge of God: I speak <span class="add">this</span> to move you to shame. </span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_35" data-id="C115_35">But some one will say, How are the dead raised? and with what manner of body do they come?</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_36" data-id="C115_36">Thou foolish one, that which thou thyself sowest is not quickened except it die:</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_37" data-id="C115_37">and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other kind; </span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_38" data-id="C115_38">but God giveth it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_39" data-id="C115_39">All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one <span class="add">flesh</span> of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fishes. </span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_40" data-id="C115_40">There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the <span class="add">glory</span> of the terrestrial is another. </span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_41" data-id="C115_41">There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory. </span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_42" data-id="C115_42">So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_43" data-id="C115_43">it is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_44" data-id="C115_44">it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual <span class="add">body</span>. </span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_45" data-id="C115_45">So also it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul. The last Adam <span class="add">became</span> a life-giving spirit. </span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_46" data-id="C115_46">Howbeit that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; then that which is spiritual.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_47" data-id="C115_47">The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is of heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_48" data-id="C115_48">As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_49" data-id="C115_49">And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_50" data-id="C115_50">Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. </span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_51" data-id="C115_51">Behold, I tell you a mystery: We all shall not sleep, but we shall all be changed,</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_52" data-id="C115_52">in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_53" data-id="C115_53">For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</span>
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_54" data-id="C115_54">But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</span>
<span class="v-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_55" data-id="C115_55">O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?</span>
<span class="v-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_56" data-id="C115_56">The sting of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law:</span>
<span class="v-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_57" data-id="C115_57">but thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span><span class="v C115_58" data-id="C115_58">Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not vain in the Lord. </span>
