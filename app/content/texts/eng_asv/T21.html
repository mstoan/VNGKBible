<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_1" data-id="T21_1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_2" data-id="T21_2">to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_3" data-id="T21_3">I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience, how unceasing is my remembrance of thee in my supplications, night and day </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_4" data-id="T21_4">longing to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_5" data-id="T21_5">having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in thee; which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and, I am persuaded, in thee also. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_6" data-id="T21_6">For which cause I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee through the laying on of my hands. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_7" data-id="T21_7">For God gave us not a spirit of fearfulness; but of power and love and discipline.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_8" data-id="T21_8">Be not ashamed therefore of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but suffer hardship with the gospel according to the power of God; </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_9" data-id="T21_9">who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_10" data-id="T21_10">but hath now been manifested by the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel, </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_11" data-id="T21_11">whereunto I was appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_12" data-id="T21_12">For which cause I suffer also these things: yet I am not ashamed; for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed unto him against that day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_13" data-id="T21_13">Hold the pattern of sound words which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_16" data-id="T21_16">The Lord grant mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus: for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_17" data-id="T21_17">but, when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me</span>
