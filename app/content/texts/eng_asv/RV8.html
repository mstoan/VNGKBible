<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_1" data-id="RV8_1">And when he opened the seventh seal, there followed a silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_2" data-id="RV8_2">And I saw the seven angels that stand before God; and there were given unto them seven trumpets.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_3" data-id="RV8_3">And another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should add it unto the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_4" data-id="RV8_4">And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angelâ€™s hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_5" data-id="RV8_5">And the angel taketh the censer; and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast it upon the earth: and there followed thunders, and voices, and lightnings, and an earthquake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_6" data-id="RV8_6">And the seven angels that had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_7" data-id="RV8_7">And the first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of the earth was burnt up, and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_8" data-id="RV8_8">And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood; </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_9" data-id="RV8_9">and there died the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, <span class="add">even</span> they that had life; and the third part of the ships was destroyed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_10" data-id="RV8_10">And the third angel sounded, and there fell from heaven a great star, burning as a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of the waters; </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_11" data-id="RV8_11">and the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_12" data-id="RV8_12">And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; that the third part of them should be darkened, and the day should not shine for the third part of it, and the night in like manner. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV8_13" data-id="RV8_13">And I saw, and I heard an eagle, flying in mid heaven, saying with a great voice, Woe, woe, woe, for them that dwell on the earth, by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, who are yet to sound.</span>
