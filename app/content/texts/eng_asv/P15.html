<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_1" data-id="P15_1">The elders therefore among you I exhort, who am a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_2" data-id="P15_2">Tend the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not of constraint, but willingly, according to <span class="add">the will of</span> God; nor yet for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_3" data-id="P15_3">neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you, but making yourselves ensamples to the flock.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_4" data-id="P15_4">And when the chief Shepherd shall be manifested, ye shall receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_5" data-id="P15_5">Likewise, ye younger, be subject unto the elder. Yea, all of you gird yourselves with humility, to serve one another: for God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_6" data-id="P15_6">Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_7" data-id="P15_7">casting all your anxiety upon him, because he careth for you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_8" data-id="P15_8">Be sober, be watchful: your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_9" data-id="P15_9">whom withstand stedfast in your faith, knowing that the same sufferings are accomplished in your brethren who are in the world. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_10" data-id="P15_10">And the God of all grace, who called you unto his eternal glory in Christ, after that ye have suffered a little while, shall himself perfect, establish, strengthen you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v P15_11" data-id="P15_11">To him <span class="add">be</span> the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</span>
