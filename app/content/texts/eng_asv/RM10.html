<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_1" data-id="RM10_1">Brethren, my heart’s desire and my supplication to God is for them, that they may be saved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_2" data-id="RM10_2">For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_3" data-id="RM10_3">For being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_4" data-id="RM10_4">For Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to every one that believeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_5" data-id="RM10_5">For Moses writeth that the man that doeth the righteousness which is of the law shall live thereby.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_6" data-id="RM10_6">But the righteousness which is of faith saith thus, Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down:) </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_7" data-id="RM10_7">or, Who shall descend into the abyss? (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_8" data-id="RM10_8">But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_9" data-id="RM10_9">because if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus <span class="add">as</span> Lord, and shalt believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved: </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_10" data-id="RM10_10">for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_11" data-id="RM10_11">For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be put to shame.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_12" data-id="RM10_12">For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek: for the same <span class="add">Lord</span> is Lord of all, and is rich unto all that call upon him:</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_13" data-id="RM10_13">for, Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_14" data-id="RM10_14">How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_15" data-id="RM10_15">and how shall they preach, except they be sent? even as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad tidings of good things! </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_16" data-id="RM10_16">But they did not all hearken to the glad tidings. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_17" data-id="RM10_17">So belief <span class="add">cometh</span> of hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_18" data-id="RM10_18">But I say, Did they not hear? Yea, verily,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM10_18" data-id="RM10_18">Their sound went out into all the earth,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM10_18" data-id="RM10_18">And their words unto the ends of the world.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_19" data-id="RM10_19">But I say, Did Israel not know? First Moses saith,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM10_19" data-id="RM10_19">I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM10_19" data-id="RM10_19">With a nation void of understanding will I anger you.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_20" data-id="RM10_20">And Isaiah is very bold, and saith,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM10_20" data-id="RM10_20">I was found of them that sought me not;</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM10_20" data-id="RM10_20">I became manifest unto them that asked not of me.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM10_21" data-id="RM10_21">But as to Israel he saith, All the day long did I spread out my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.</span>
