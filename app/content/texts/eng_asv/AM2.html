<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_1" data-id="AM2_1">Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Moab, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime: </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_2" data-id="AM2_2">but I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth; and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet; </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_3" data-id="AM2_3">and I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_4" data-id="AM2_4">Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Judah, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have rejected the law of Jehovah, and have not kept his statutes, and their lies have caused them to err, after which their fathers did walk: </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_5" data-id="AM2_5">but I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_6" data-id="AM2_6">Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Israel, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have sold the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoesâ€”</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_7" data-id="AM2_7">they that pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father go unto the <span class="add">same</span> maiden, to profane my holy name:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_8" data-id="AM2_8">and they lay themselves down beside every altar upon clothes taken in pledge; and in the house of their God they drink the wine of such as have been fined. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_9" data-id="AM2_9">Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_10" data-id="AM2_10">Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_11" data-id="AM2_11">And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazirites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith Jehovah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM2_12" data-id="AM2_12">But ye gave the Nazirites wine to drink, and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.</span>
