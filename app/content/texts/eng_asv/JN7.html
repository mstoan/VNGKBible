<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_1" data-id="JN7_1">And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judæa, because the Jews sought to kill him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_2" data-id="JN7_2">Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles, was at hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_3" data-id="JN7_3">His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judæa, that thy disciples also may behold thy works which thou doest. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_4" data-id="JN7_4">For no man doeth anything in secret, and himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_5" data-id="JN7_5">For even his brethren did not believe on him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_6" data-id="JN7_6">Jesus therefore saith unto them, My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_7" data-id="JN7_7">The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that its works are evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_8" data-id="JN7_8">Go ye up unto the feast: I go not up unto this feast; because my time is not yet fulfilled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_9" data-id="JN7_9">And having said these things unto them, he abode <span class="add">still</span> in Galilee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_10" data-id="JN7_10">But when his brethren were gone up unto the feast, then went he also up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_11" data-id="JN7_11">The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_12" data-id="JN7_12">And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him: some said, He is a good man; others said, Not so, but he leadeth the multitude astray. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_13" data-id="JN7_13">Yet no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_14" data-id="JN7_14">But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_15" data-id="JN7_15">The Jews therefore marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_16" data-id="JN7_16">Jesus therefore answered them, and said, My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_17" data-id="JN7_17">If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or <span class="add">whether</span> I speak from myself. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_18" data-id="JN7_18">He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_19" data-id="JN7_19">Did not Moses give you the law, and <span class="add">yet</span> none of you doeth the law? Why seek ye to kill me?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_20" data-id="JN7_20">The multitude answered, Thou hast a demon: who seeketh to kill thee?</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_21" data-id="JN7_21">Jesus answered and said unto them, I did one work, and ye all marvel because thereof.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_22" data-id="JN7_22">Moses hath given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers); and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_23" data-id="JN7_23">If a man receiveth circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are ye wroth with me, because I made a man every whit whole on the sabbath? </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_24" data-id="JN7_24">Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_25" data-id="JN7_25">Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_26" data-id="JN7_26">And lo, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing unto him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ?</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_27" data-id="JN7_27">Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no one knoweth whence he is.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_28" data-id="JN7_28">Jesus therefore cried in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me, and know whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_29" data-id="JN7_29">I know him; because I am from him, and he sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_30" data-id="JN7_30">They sought therefore to take him: and no man laid his hand on him, because his hour was not yet come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_31" data-id="JN7_31">But of the multitude many believed on him; and they said, When the Christ shall come, will he do more signs than those which this man hath done? </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_32" data-id="JN7_32">The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_33" data-id="JN7_33">Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while am I with you, and I go unto him that sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_34" data-id="JN7_34">Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_35" data-id="JN7_35">The Jews therefore said among themselves, Whither will this man go that we shall not find him? will he go unto the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? </span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_36" data-id="JN7_36">What is this word that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, ye cannot come?</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_37" data-id="JN7_37">Now on the last day, the great <span class="add">day</span> of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink. </span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_38" data-id="JN7_38">He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, from within him shall flow rivers of living water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_39" data-id="JN7_39">But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit was not yet <span class="add">given</span>; because Jesus was not yet glorified. </span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_40" data-id="JN7_40"> <span class="add">Some</span> of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is of a truth the prophet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_41" data-id="JN7_41">Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, What, doth the Christ come out of Galilee?</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_42" data-id="JN7_42">Hath not the scripture said that the Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_43" data-id="JN7_43">So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_44" data-id="JN7_44">And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_45" data-id="JN7_45">The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why did ye not bring him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_46" data-id="JN7_46">The officers answered, Never man so spake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_47" data-id="JN7_47">The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also led astray?</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_48" data-id="JN7_48">Hath any of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees?</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_49" data-id="JN7_49">But this multitude that knoweth not the law are accursed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_50" data-id="JN7_50">Nicodemus saith unto them (he that came to him before, being one of them),</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_51" data-id="JN7_51">Doth our law judge a man, except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth?</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN7_52" data-id="JN7_52">They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</span>
