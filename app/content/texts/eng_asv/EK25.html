<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_1" data-id="EK25_1">And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_2" data-id="EK25_2">Son of man, set thy face toward the children of Ammon, and prophesy against them:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_3" data-id="EK25_3">and say unto the children of Ammon, Hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was made desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity: </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_4" data-id="EK25_4">therefore, behold, I will deliver thee to the children of the east for a possession, and they shall set their encampments in thee, and make their dwellings in thee; they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_5" data-id="EK25_5">And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the children of Ammon a couching-place for flocks: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_6" data-id="EK25_6">For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast clapped thy hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced with all the despite of thy soul against the land of Israel; </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_7" data-id="EK25_7">therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the nations; and I will cut thee off from the peoples, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_8" data-id="EK25_8">Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the nations;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_9" data-id="EK25_9">therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim, </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_10" data-id="EK25_10">unto the children of the east, <span class="add">to go</span> against the children of Ammon; and I will give them for a possession, that the children of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_11" data-id="EK25_11">and I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_12" data-id="EK25_12">Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them; </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_13" data-id="EK25_13">therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, I will stretch out my hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; even unto Dedan shall they fall by the sword.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK25_14" data-id="EK25_14">And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my wrath; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord Jehovah.</span>
