<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_1" data-id="MT26_1">And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these words, he said unto his disciples,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_2" data-id="MT26_2">Ye know that after two days the passover cometh, and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_3" data-id="MT26_3">Then were gathered together the chief priests, and the elders of the people, unto the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas; </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_4" data-id="MT26_4">and they took counsel together that they might take Jesus by subtlety, and kill him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_5" data-id="MT26_5">But they said, Not during the feast, lest a tumult arise among the people.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_6" data-id="MT26_6">Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_7" data-id="MT26_7">there came unto him a woman having an alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment, and she poured it upon his head, as he sat at meat. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_8" data-id="MT26_8">But when the disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_9" data-id="MT26_9">For this <span class="add">ointment</span> might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_10" data-id="MT26_10">But Jesus perceiving it said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_11" data-id="MT26_11">For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_12" data-id="MT26_12">For in that she poured this ointment upon my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_13" data-id="MT26_13">Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_14" data-id="MT26_14">Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_15" data-id="MT26_15">and said, What are ye willing to give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they weighed unto him thirty pieces of silver. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_16" data-id="MT26_16">And from that time he sought opportunity to deliver him <span class="add">unto them. </span> </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_17" data-id="MT26_17">Now on the first <span class="add">day</span> of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where wilt thou that we make ready for thee to eat the passover? </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_18" data-id="MT26_18">And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Teacher saith, My time is at hand; I keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_19" data-id="MT26_19">And the disciples did as Jesus appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_20" data-id="MT26_20">Now when even was come, he was sitting at meat with the twelve disciples;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_21" data-id="MT26_21">and as they were eating, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_22" data-id="MT26_22">And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began to say unto him every one, Is it I, Lord?</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_23" data-id="MT26_23">And he answered and said, He that dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_24" data-id="MT26_24">The Son of man goeth, even as it is written of him: but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had not been born. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_25" data-id="MT26_25">And Judas, who betrayed him, answered and said, Is it I, Rabbi? He saith unto him, Thou hast said.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_26" data-id="MT26_26">And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it; and he gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_27" data-id="MT26_27">And he took a cup, and gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_28" data-id="MT26_28">for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many unto remission of sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_29" data-id="MT26_29">But I say unto you, I shall not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_30" data-id="MT26_30">And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_31" data-id="MT26_31">Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended in me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_32" data-id="MT26_32">But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_33" data-id="MT26_33">But Peter answered and said unto him, If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_34" data-id="MT26_34">Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_35" data-id="MT26_35">Peter saith unto him, Even if I must die with thee, <span class="add">yet</span> will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_36" data-id="MT26_36">Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I go yonder and pray. </span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_37" data-id="MT26_37">And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_38" data-id="MT26_38">Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: abide ye here, and watch with me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_39" data-id="MT26_39">And he went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt. </span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_40" data-id="MT26_40">And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour? </span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_41" data-id="MT26_41">Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_42" data-id="MT26_42">Again a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, thy will be done. </span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_43" data-id="MT26_43">And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_44" data-id="MT26_44">And he left them again, and went away, and prayed a third time, saying again the same words.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_45" data-id="MT26_45">Then cometh he to the disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. </span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_46" data-id="MT26_46">Arise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that betrayeth me.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_47" data-id="MT26_47">And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. </span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_48" data-id="MT26_48">Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he: take him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_49" data-id="MT26_49">And straightway he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_50" data-id="MT26_50">And Jesus said unto him, Friend, <span class="add">do</span> that for which thou art come. Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_51" data-id="MT26_51">And behold, one of them that were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear. </span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_52" data-id="MT26_52">Then saith Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into its place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. </span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_53" data-id="MT26_53">Or thinkest thou that I cannot beseech my Father, and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?</span>
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_54" data-id="MT26_54">How then should the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</span>
<span class="v-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_55" data-id="MT26_55">In that hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and ye took me not. </span>
<span class="v-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_56" data-id="MT26_56">But all this is come to pass, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him, and fled. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_57" data-id="MT26_57">And they that had taken Jesus led him away to <span class="add">the house of </span> Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_58" data-id="MT26_58">But Peter followed him afar off, unto the court of the high priest, and entered in, and sat with the officers, to see the end. </span>
<span class="v-num v-59">59&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_59" data-id="MT26_59">Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death;</span>
<span class="v-num v-60">60&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_60" data-id="MT26_60">and they found it not, though many false witnesses came. But afterward came two,</span>
<span class="v-num v-61">61&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_61" data-id="MT26_61">and said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-62">62&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_62" data-id="MT26_62">And the high priest stood up, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</span>
<span class="v-num v-63">63&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_63" data-id="MT26_63">But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ, the Son of God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-64">64&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_64" data-id="MT26_64">Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven. </span>
<span class="v-num v-65">65&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_65" data-id="MT26_65">Then the high priest rent his garments, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy: what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy: </span>
<span class="v-num v-66">66&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_66" data-id="MT26_66">what think ye? They answered and said, He is worthy of death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-67">67&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_67" data-id="MT26_67">Then did they spit in his face and buffet him: and some smote him with the palms of their hands,</span>
<span class="v-num v-68">68&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_68" data-id="MT26_68">saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ: who is he that struck thee?</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-69">69&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_69" data-id="MT26_69">Now Peter was sitting without in the court: and a maid came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilæan.</span>
<span class="v-num v-70">70&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_70" data-id="MT26_70">But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-71">71&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_71" data-id="MT26_71">And when he was gone out into the porch, another <span class="add">maid</span> saw him, and saith unto them that were there, This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-72">72&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_72" data-id="MT26_72">And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-73">73&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_73" data-id="MT26_73">And after a little while they that stood by came and said to Peter, Of a truth thou also art <span class="add">one</span> of them; for thy speech maketh thee known. </span>
<span class="v-num v-74">74&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_74" data-id="MT26_74">Then began he to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And straightway the cock crew.</span>
<span class="v-num v-75">75&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT26_75" data-id="MT26_75">And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly. </span>
