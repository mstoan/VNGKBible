<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_1" data-id="JN17_1">These things spake Jesus; and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that the Son may glorify thee: </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_2" data-id="JN17_2">even as thou gavest him authority over all flesh, that to all whom thou hast given him, he should give eternal life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_3" data-id="JN17_3">And this is life eternal, that they should know thee the only true God, and him whom thou didst send, <span class="add">even</span> Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_4" data-id="JN17_4">I glorified thee on the earth, having accomplished the work which thou hast given me to do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_5" data-id="JN17_5">And now, Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_6" data-id="JN17_6">I manifested thy name unto the men whom thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them to me; and they have kept thy word. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_7" data-id="JN17_7">Now they know that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are from thee:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_8" data-id="JN17_8">for the words which thou gavest me I have given unto them; and they received <span class="add">them</span>, and knew of a truth that I came forth from thee, and they believed that thou didst send me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_9" data-id="JN17_9">I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou hast given me; for they are thine:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_10" data-id="JN17_10">and all things that are mine are thine, and thine are mine: and I am glorified in them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_11" data-id="JN17_11">And I am no more in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one, even as we <span class="add">are</span>.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_12" data-id="JN17_12">While I was with them, I kept them in thy name which thou hast given me: and I guarded them, and not one of them perished, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_13" data-id="JN17_13">But now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_14" data-id="JN17_14">I have given them thy word; and the world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_15" data-id="JN17_15">I pray not that thou shouldest take them from the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil <span class="add">one</span>. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_16" data-id="JN17_16">They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_17" data-id="JN17_17">Sanctify them in the truth: thy word is truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_18" data-id="JN17_18">As thou didst send me into the world, even so sent I them into the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_19" data-id="JN17_19">And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_20" data-id="JN17_20">Neither for these only do I pray, but for them also that believe on me through their word;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_21" data-id="JN17_21">that they may all be one; even as thou, Father, <span class="add">art</span> in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us: that the world may believe that thou didst send me. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_22" data-id="JN17_22">And the glory which thou hast given me I have given unto them; that they may be one, even as we <span class="add">are</span> one; </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_23" data-id="JN17_23">I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that thou didst send me, and lovedst them, even as thou lovedst me. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_24" data-id="JN17_24">Father, I desire that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_25" data-id="JN17_25">O righteous Father, the world knew thee not, but I knew thee; and these knew that thou didst send me;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN17_26" data-id="JN17_26">and I made known unto them thy name, and will make it known; that the love wherewith thou lovedst me may be in them, and I in them. </span>
