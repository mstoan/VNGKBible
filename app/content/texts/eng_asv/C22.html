<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_1" data-id="C22_1">But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you with sorrow.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_2" data-id="C22_2">For if I make you sorry, who then is he that maketh me glad but he that is made sorry by me?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_3" data-id="C22_3">And I wrote this very thing, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is <span class="add">the joy</span> of you all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_4" data-id="C22_4">For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be made sorry, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_5" data-id="C22_5">But if any hath caused sorrow, he hath caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I press not too heavily) to you all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_6" data-id="C22_6">Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was <span class="add">inflicted </span> by the many; </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_7" data-id="C22_7">so that contrariwise ye should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his overmuch sorrow. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_8" data-id="C22_8">Wherefore I beseech you to confirm <span class="add">your</span> love toward him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_9" data-id="C22_9">For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_10" data-id="C22_10">But to whom ye forgive anything, I <span class="add">forgive</span> also: for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes <span class="add">have I forgiven it</span> in the presence of Christ;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_11" data-id="C22_11">that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_12" data-id="C22_12">Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and when a door was opened unto me in the Lord,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_13" data-id="C22_13">I had no relief for my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_14" data-id="C22_14">But thanks be unto God, who always leadeth us in triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest through us the savor of his knowledge in every place. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_15" data-id="C22_15">For we are a sweet savor of Christ unto God, in them that are saved, and in them that perish;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_16" data-id="C22_16">to the one a savor from death unto death; to the other a savor from life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things? </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C22_17" data-id="C22_17">For we are not as the many, corrupting the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, speak we in Christ. </span>
