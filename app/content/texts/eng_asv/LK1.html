<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_1" data-id="LK1_1">Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to draw up a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_2" data-id="LK1_2">even as they delivered them unto us, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_3" data-id="LK1_3">it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus; </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_4" data-id="LK1_4">that thou mightest know the certainty concerning the things wherein thou wast instructed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_5" data-id="LK1_5">There was in the days of Herod, king of Judæa, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abijah: and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_6" data-id="LK1_6">And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_7" data-id="LK1_7">And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were <span class="add">now</span> well stricken in years. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_8" data-id="LK1_8">Now it came to pass, while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his course,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_9" data-id="LK1_9">according to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_10" data-id="LK1_10">And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_11" data-id="LK1_11">And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_12" data-id="LK1_12">And Zacharias was troubled when he saw <span class="add">him</span>, and fear fell upon him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_13" data-id="LK1_13">But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: because thy supplication is heard, and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_14" data-id="LK1_14">And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_15" data-id="LK1_15">For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_16" data-id="LK1_16">And many of the children of Israel shall he turn unto the Lord their God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_17" data-id="LK1_17">And he shall go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient <span class="add">to walk</span> in the wisdom of the just; to make ready for the Lord a people prepared <span class="add">for him</span>. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_18" data-id="LK1_18">And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_19" data-id="LK1_19">And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak unto thee, and to bring thee these good tidings. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_20" data-id="LK1_20">And behold, thou shalt be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall come to pass, because thou believedst not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_21" data-id="LK1_21">And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marvelled while he tarried in the temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_22" data-id="LK1_22">And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: and he continued making signs unto them, and remained dumb. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_23" data-id="LK1_23">And it came to pass, when the days of his ministration were fulfilled, he departed unto his house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_24" data-id="LK1_24">And after these days Elisabeth his wife conceived; and she hid herself five months, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_25" data-id="LK1_25">Thus hath the Lord done unto me in the days wherein he looked upon <span class="add">me</span>, to take away my reproach among men. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_26" data-id="LK1_26">Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_27" data-id="LK1_27">to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_28" data-id="LK1_28">And he came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favored, the Lord <span class="add">is</span> with thee. </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_29" data-id="LK1_29">But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this might be.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_30" data-id="LK1_30">And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favor with God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_31" data-id="LK1_31">And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_32" data-id="LK1_32">He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: </span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_33" data-id="LK1_33">and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_34" data-id="LK1_34">And Mary said unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_35" data-id="LK1_35">And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee: wherefore also the holy thing which is begotten shall be called the Son of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_36" data-id="LK1_36">And behold, Elisabeth thy kinswoman, she also hath conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her that was called barren. </span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_37" data-id="LK1_37">For no word from God shall be void of power.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_38" data-id="LK1_38">And Mary said, Behold, the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_39" data-id="LK1_39">And Mary arose in these days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah;</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_40" data-id="LK1_40">and entered into the house of Zacharias and saluted Elisabeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_41" data-id="LK1_41">And it came to pass, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit; </span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_42" data-id="LK1_42">and she lifted up her voice with a loud cry, and said, Blessed <span class="add">art</span> thou among women, and blessed <span class="add">is</span> the fruit of thy womb.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_43" data-id="LK1_43">And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come unto me?</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_44" data-id="LK1_44">For behold, when the voice of thy salutation came into mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_45" data-id="LK1_45">And blessed <span class="add">is</span> she that believed; for there shall be a fulfilment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord. </span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK1_46" data-id="LK1_46">And Mary said,</span>
