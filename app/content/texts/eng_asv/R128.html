<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R128_2" data-id="R128_2">Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: as for me, it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and for the footstool of our God; and I had made ready for the building. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R128_3" data-id="R128_3">But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build a house for my name, because thou art a man of war, and hast shed blood.</span>

<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R128_5" data-id="R128_5">And of all my sons (for Jehovah hath given me many sons), he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of Jehovah over Israel. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R128_6" data-id="R128_6">And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R128_7" data-id="R128_7">And I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and mine ordinances, as at this day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R128_8" data-id="R128_8">Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of Jehovah, and in the audience of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of Jehovah your God; that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you for ever. </span>
