<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_1" data-id="MK16_1">And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the <span class="add">mother </span> of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.
</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_2" data-id="MK16_2">And very early on the first day of the week, they come to the tomb when the sun was risen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_3" data-id="MK16_3">And they were saying among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the tomb?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_4" data-id="MK16_4">and looking up, they see that the stone is rolled back: for it was exceeding great.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_5" data-id="MK16_5">And entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, arrayed in a white robe; and they were amazed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_6" data-id="MK16_6">And he saith unto them, Be not amazed: ye seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who hath been crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold, the place where they laid him! 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_7" data-id="MK16_7">But go, tell his disciples and Peter, He goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_8" data-id="MK16_8">And they went out, and fled from the tomb; for trembling and astonishment had come upon them: and they said nothing to any one; for they were afraid. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_9" data-id="MK16_9">Now when he was risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_10" data-id="MK16_10">She went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_11" data-id="MK16_11">And they, when they heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, disbelieved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_12" data-id="MK16_12">And after these things he was manifested in another form unto two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_13" data-id="MK16_13">And they went away and told it unto the rest: neither believed they them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_14" data-id="MK16_14">And afterward he was manifested unto the eleven themselves as they sat at meat; and he upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them that had seen him after he was risen.
</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_15" data-id="MK16_15">And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to the whole creation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_16" data-id="MK16_16">He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_17" data-id="MK16_17">And these signs shall accompany them that believe: in my name shall they cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues; 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_18" data-id="MK16_18">they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall in no wise hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_19" data-id="MK16_19">So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken unto them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK16_20" data-id="MK16_20">And they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs that followed. Amen. </span>
