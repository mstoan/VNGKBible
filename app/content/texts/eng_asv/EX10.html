<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_1" data-id="EX10_1">And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I may show these my signs in the midst of them, </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_2" data-id="EX10_2">and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son’s son, what things I have wrought upon Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know that I am Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_3" data-id="EX10_3">And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_4" data-id="EX10_4">Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to-morrow will I bring locusts into thy border:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_5" data-id="EX10_5">and they shall cover the face of the earth, so that one shall not be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field: </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_6" data-id="EX10_6">and thy houses shall be filled, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; as neither thy fathers nor thy fathers’ fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day.

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_7" data-id="EX10_7">And Pharaoh’s servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve Jehovah their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_8" data-id="EX10_8">And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve Jehovah your God; but who are they that shall go? </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_9" data-id="EX10_9">And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old; with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto Jehovah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_10" data-id="EX10_10">And he said unto them, So be Jehovah with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you. </span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_15" data-id="EX10_15">For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_16" data-id="EX10_16">Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against Jehovah your God, and against you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_17" data-id="EX10_17">Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat Jehovah your God, that he may take away from me this death only. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_18" data-id="EX10_18">And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX10_19" data-id="EX10_19">And Jehovah turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea; there remained not one locust in all the border of Egypt. </span>
