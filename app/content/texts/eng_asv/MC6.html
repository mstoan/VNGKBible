<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_1" data-id="MC6_1">Hear ye now what Jehovah saith: Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_2" data-id="MC6_2">Hear, O ye mountains, Jehovahâ€™s controversy, and ye enduring foundations of the earth; for Jehovah hath a controversy with his people, and he will contend with Israel. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_3" data-id="MC6_3">O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_4" data-id="MC6_4">For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_5" data-id="MC6_5">O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; <span class="add">remember</span> from Shittim unto Gilgal, that ye may know the righteous acts of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_6" data-id="MC6_6">Wherewith shall I come before Jehovah, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves a year old? </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_7" data-id="MC6_7">will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams, <span class="add">or</span> with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_8" data-id="MC6_8">He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth Jehovah require of thee, but to do justly, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with thy God? </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_9" data-id="MC6_9">The voice of Jehovah crieth unto the city, and <span class="add">the man of </span> wisdom will see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_10" data-id="MC6_10">Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and a scant measure that is abominable?</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_11" data-id="MC6_11">Shall I be pure with wicked balances, and with a bag of deceitful weights?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_12" data-id="MC6_12">For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_13" data-id="MC6_13">Therefore I also have smitten thee with a grievous wound; I have made thee desolate because of thy sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_14" data-id="MC6_14">Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy humiliation shall be in the midst of thee: and thou shalt put away, but shalt not save; and that which thou savest will I give up to the sword.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_15" data-id="MC6_15">Thou shalt sow, but shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but shalt not anoint thee with oil; and the vintage, but shalt not drink the wine. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MC6_16" data-id="MC6_16">For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I may make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof a hissing: and ye shall bear the reproach of my people.</span>
