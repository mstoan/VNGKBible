<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_1" data-id="JN19_1">Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_2" data-id="JN19_2">And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple garment;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_3" data-id="JN19_3">and they came unto him, and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they struck him with their hands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_4" data-id="JN19_4">And Pilate went out again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find no crime in him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_5" data-id="JN19_5">Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. And <span class="add">Pilate</span> saith unto them, Behold, the man! </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_6" data-id="JN19_6">When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify <span class="add">him</span>, crucify <span class="add">him</span>! Pilate saith unto them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him: for I find no crime in him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_7" data-id="JN19_7">The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_8" data-id="JN19_8">When Pilate therefore heard this saying, he was the more afraid;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_9" data-id="JN19_9">and he entered into the Prætorium again, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_10" data-id="JN19_10">Pilate therefore saith unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and have power to crucify thee? </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_11" data-id="JN19_11">Jesus answered him, Thou wouldest have no power against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_12" data-id="JN19_12">Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not Cæsar’s friend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Cæsar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_13" data-id="JN19_13">When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment-seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_14" data-id="JN19_14">Now it was the Preparation of the passover: it was about the sixth hour. And he saith unto the Jews, Behold, your King!</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_15" data-id="JN19_15">They therefore cried out, Away with <span class="add">him</span>, away with <span class="add">him</span>, crucify him! Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Cæsar. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_16" data-id="JN19_16">Then therefore he delivered him unto them to be crucified.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_17" data-id="JN19_17">They took Jesus therefore: and he went out, bearing the cross for himself, unto the place called The place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew Golgotha: </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_18" data-id="JN19_18">where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_19" data-id="JN19_19">And Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. And there was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_20" data-id="JN19_20">This title therefore read many of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city; and it was written in Hebrew, <span class="add">and </span> in Latin, <span class="add">and</span> in Greek.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_21" data-id="JN19_21">The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but, that he said, I am King of the Jews. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_22" data-id="JN19_22">Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_23" data-id="JN19_23">The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_24" data-id="JN19_24">They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v JN19_24" data-id="JN19_24">They parted my garments among them,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v JN19_24" data-id="JN19_24">And upon my vesture did they cast lots.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_25" data-id="JN19_25">These things therefore the soldiers did. But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the <span class="add">wife </span> of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_26" data-id="JN19_26">When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold, thy son! </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_27" data-id="JN19_27">Then saith he to the disciple, Behold, thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own <span class="add">home</span>. </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_28" data-id="JN19_28">After this Jesus, knowing that all things are now finished, that the scripture might be accomplished, saith, I thirst.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_29" data-id="JN19_29">There was set there a vessel full of vinegar: so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop, and brought it to his mouth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_30" data-id="JN19_30">When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_31" data-id="JN19_31">The Jews therefore, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath (for the day of that sabbath was a high <span class="add">day</span>), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and <span class="add">that</span> they might be taken away. </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_32" data-id="JN19_32">The soldiers therefore came, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him:</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_33" data-id="JN19_33">but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_34" data-id="JN19_34">howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and straightway there came out blood and water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_35" data-id="JN19_35">And he that hath seen hath borne witness, and his witness is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye also may believe. </span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_36" data-id="JN19_36">For these things came to pass, that the scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_37" data-id="JN19_37">And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_38" data-id="JN19_38">And after these things Joseph of Arimathæa, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave <span class="add">him</span> leave. He came therefore, and took away his body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_39" data-id="JN19_39">And there came also Nicodemus, he who at the first came to him by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds. </span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_40" data-id="JN19_40">So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_41" data-id="JN19_41">Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man yet laid.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN19_42" data-id="JN19_42">There then because of the Jews’ Preparation (for the tomb was nigh at hand) they laid Jesus.</span>
