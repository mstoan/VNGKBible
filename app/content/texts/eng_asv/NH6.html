<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH6_1" data-id="NH6_1">Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and unto the rest of our enemies, that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein (though even unto that time I had not set up the doors in the gates), </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH6_2" data-id="NH6_2">that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me saying, Come, let us meet together in <span class="add">one of</span> the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH6_3" data-id="NH6_3">And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you? </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH6_4" data-id="NH6_4">And they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH6_5" data-id="NH6_5">Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH6_6" data-id="NH6_6">wherein was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause thou art building the wall: and thou wouldest be their king, according to these words.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH6_7" data-id="NH6_7">And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH6_8" data-id="NH6_8">Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH6_9" data-id="NH6_9">For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. But now, <span class="add">O God</span>, strengthen thou my hands. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH6_10" data-id="NH6_10">And I went unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH6_11" data-id="NH6_11">And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH6_12" data-id="NH6_12">And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH6_13" data-id="NH6_13">For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH6_14" data-id="NH6_14">Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH6_15" data-id="NH6_15">So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth <span class="add">day</span> of <span class="add">the month</span> Elul, in fifty and two days. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH6_16" data-id="NH6_16">And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard <span class="add">thereof</span>, that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH6_17" data-id="NH6_17">Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and <span class="add">the letters</span> of Tobiah came unto them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH6_18" data-id="NH6_18">For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH6_19" data-id="NH6_19">Also they spake of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. <span class="add">And</span> Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear. </span>
