<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C28_1" data-id="C28_1">Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God which hath been given in the churches of Macedonia;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C28_2" data-id="C28_2">how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C28_3" data-id="C28_3">For according to their power, I bear witness, yea and beyond their power, <span class="add">they gave</span> of their own accord, </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C28_4" data-id="C28_4">beseeching us with much entreaty in regard of this grace and the fellowship in the ministering to the saints:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C28_5" data-id="C28_5">and <span class="add">this</span>, not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C28_6" data-id="C28_6">Insomuch that we exhorted Titus, that as he had made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C28_7" data-id="C28_7">But as ye abound in everything, <span class="add">in</span> faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and <span class="add">in</span> all earnestness, and <span class="add">in</span> your love to us, <span class="add">see</span> that ye abound in this grace also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C28_8" data-id="C28_8">I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C28_9" data-id="C28_9">For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might become rich. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C28_10" data-id="C28_10">And herein I give <span class="add">my</span> judgment: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to make a beginning a year ago, not only to do, but also to will. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C28_11" data-id="C28_11">But now complete the doing also; that as <span class="add">there was</span> the readiness to will, so <span class="add">there may be</span> the completion also out of your ability. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C28_12" data-id="C28_12">For if the readiness is there, <span class="add">it is</span> acceptable according as <span class="add">a man</span> hath, not according as <span class="add">he</span> hath not. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C28_13" data-id="C28_13">For <span class="add">I say</span> not <span class="add">this</span> that others may be eased <span class="add">and</span> ye distressed; </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C28_14" data-id="C28_14">but by equality: your abundance <span class="add">being a supply</span> at this present time for their want, that their abundance also may become <span class="add">a supply </span> for your want; that there may be equality:</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C28_15" data-id="C28_15">as it is written, He that <span class="add">gathered</span> much had nothing over; and he that <span class="add">gathered</span> little had no lack. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C28_16" data-id="C28_16">But thanks be to God, who putteth the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C28_17" data-id="C28_17">For he accepted indeed our exhortation; but being himself very earnest, he went forth unto you of his own accord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C28_18" data-id="C28_18">And we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel <span class="add">is spread</span> through all the churches; </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C28_19" data-id="C28_19">and not only so, but who was also appointed by the churches to travel with us in <span class="add">the matter of</span> this grace, which is ministered by us to the glory of the Lord, and <span class="add">to show</span> our readiness: </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C28_20" data-id="C28_20">Avoiding this, that any man should blame us in <span class="add">the matter of </span> this bounty which is ministered by us: </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C28_21" data-id="C28_21">for we take thought for things honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C28_22" data-id="C28_22">And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which <span class="add">he hath</span> in you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C28_23" data-id="C28_23">Whether <span class="add">any inquire</span> about Titus, <span class="add">he is</span> my partner and <span class="add">my</span> fellow-worker to you-ward; or our brethren, <span class="add">they are </span> the messengers of the churches, <span class="add">they are</span> the glory of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C28_24" data-id="C28_24">Show ye therefore unto them in the face of the churches the proof of your love, and of our glorying on your behalf.</span>
