<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_1" data-id="C13_1">And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_2" data-id="C13_2">I fed you with milk, not with meat; for ye were not yet able <span class="add">to bear it</span>: nay, not even now are ye able; </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_3" data-id="C13_3">for ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you jealousy and strife, are ye not carnal, and do ye not walk after the manner of men? </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_4" data-id="C13_4">For when one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not men?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_5" data-id="C13_5">What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? Ministers through whom ye believed; and each as the Lord gave to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_6" data-id="C13_6">I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_7" data-id="C13_7">So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_8" data-id="C13_8">Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_9" data-id="C13_9">For we are God’s fellow-workers: ye are God’s husbandry, God’s building.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_10" data-id="C13_10">According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_11" data-id="C13_11">For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_12" data-id="C13_12">But if any man buildeth on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_13" data-id="C13_13">each man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man’s work of what sort it is. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_14" data-id="C13_14">If any man’s work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_15" data-id="C13_15">If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_16" data-id="C13_16">Know ye not that ye are a temple of God, and <span class="add">that</span> the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_17" data-id="C13_17">If any man destroyeth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_18" data-id="C13_18">Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinketh that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_19" data-id="C13_19">For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He that taketh the wise in their craftiness:</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_20" data-id="C13_20">and again, The Lord knoweth the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_21" data-id="C13_21">Wherefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_22" data-id="C13_22">whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_23" data-id="C13_23">and ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.</span>
