<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC1_2" data-id="ZC1_2">Jehovah was sore displeased with your fathers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC1_3" data-id="ZC1_3">Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Return unto me, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will return unto you, saith Jehovah of hosts. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC1_4" data-id="ZC1_4">Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets cried, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Return ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC1_5" data-id="ZC1_5">Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC1_6" data-id="ZC1_6">But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? and they turned and said, Like as Jehovah of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC1_7" data-id="ZC1_7">Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC1_8" data-id="ZC1_8">I saw in the night, and, behold, a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle-trees that were in the bottom; and behind him there were horses, red, sorrel, and white.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC1_9" data-id="ZC1_9">Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will show thee what these are.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC1_10" data-id="ZC1_10">And the man that stood among the myrtle-trees answered and said, These are they whom Jehovah hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC1_11" data-id="ZC1_11">And they answered the angel of Jehovah that stood among the myrtle-trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC1_12" data-id="ZC1_12">Then the angel of Jehovah answered and said, O Jehovah of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC1_13" data-id="ZC1_13">And Jehovah answered the angel that talked with me with good words, <span class="add">even</span> comfortable words. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC1_14" data-id="ZC1_14">So the angel that talked with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC1_15" data-id="ZC1_15">And I am very sore displeased with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC1_16" data-id="ZC1_16">Therefore thus saith Jehovah: I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies; my house shall be built in it, saith Jehovah of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC1_17" data-id="ZC1_17">Cry yet again, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: My cities shall yet overflow with prosperity; and Jehovah shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC1_18" data-id="ZC1_18">And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, four horns.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC1_19" data-id="ZC1_19">And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC1_20" data-id="ZC1_20">And Jehovah showed me four smiths.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC1_21" data-id="ZC1_21">Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head; but these are come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it. </span>
