<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_1" data-id="P13_1">In like manner, ye wives, <span class="add">be</span> in subjection to your own husbands; that, even if any obey not the word, they may without the word be gained by the behavior of their wives; </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_2" data-id="P13_2">beholding your chaste behavior <span class="add">coupled</span> with fear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_3" data-id="P13_3">Whose <span class="add">adorning</span> let it not be the outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on apparel; </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_4" data-id="P13_4">but <span class="add">let it be</span> the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible <span class="add">apparel</span> of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_5" data-id="P13_5">For after this manner aforetime the holy women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands: </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_6" data-id="P13_6">as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose children ye now are, if ye do well, and are not put in fear by any terror. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_7" data-id="P13_7">Ye husbands, in like manner, dwell with <span class="add">your wives</span> according to knowledge, giving honor unto the woman, as unto the weaker vessel, as being also joint-heirs of the grace of life; to the end that your prayers be not hindered.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_8" data-id="P13_8">Finally, <span class="add">be</span> ye all likeminded, compassionate, loving as brethren, tenderhearted, humbleminded:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_9" data-id="P13_9">not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling; but contrariwise blessing; for hereunto were ye called, that ye should inherit a blessing. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_10" data-id="P13_10">For,</span>

<div class="q">
<span class="v P13_10" data-id="P13_10">He that would love life,</span>

<span class="v P13_10" data-id="P13_10">And see good days,</span>

<div class="q">
<span class="v P13_10" data-id="P13_10">Let him refrain his tongue from evil,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v P13_10" data-id="P13_10">And his lips that they speak no guile:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_11" data-id="P13_11">And let him turn away from evil, and do good;</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v P13_11" data-id="P13_11">Let him seek peace, and pursue it.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_12" data-id="P13_12">For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v P13_12" data-id="P13_12">And his ears unto their supplication:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v P13_12" data-id="P13_12">But the face of the Lord is upon them that do evil.</span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_13" data-id="P13_13">And who is he that will harm you, if ye be zealous of that which is good?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_14" data-id="P13_14">But even if ye should suffer for righteousnessâ€™ sake, blessed <span class="add">are ye</span>: and fear not their fear, neither be troubled; </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_15" data-id="P13_15">but sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord: <span class="add">being</span> ready always to give answer to every man that asketh you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, yet with meekness and fear:</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_16" data-id="P13_16">having a good conscience; that, wherein ye are spoken against, they may be put to shame who revile your good manner of life in Christ. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_17" data-id="P13_17">For it is better, if the will of God should so will, that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_18" data-id="P13_18">Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit; </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_19" data-id="P13_19">in which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_20" data-id="P13_20">that aforetime were disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water: </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_21" data-id="P13_21">which also after a true likeness doth now save you, <span class="add">even </span> baptism, not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the interrogation of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ; </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_22" data-id="P13_22">who is on the right hand of God, having gone into heaven; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.</span>
