<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v H22_1" data-id="H22_1">Now we beseech you, brethren, touching the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together unto him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v H22_2" data-id="H22_2">to the end that ye be not quickly shaken from your mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by epistle as from us, as that the day of the Lord is just at hand; </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v H22_3" data-id="H22_3">let no man beguile you in any wise: for <span class="add">it will not be,</span> except the falling away come first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition, </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v H22_4" data-id="H22_4">he that opposeth and exalteth himself against all that is called God or that is worshipped; so that he sitteth in the temple of God, setting himself forth as God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v H22_5" data-id="H22_5">Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v H22_6" data-id="H22_6">And now ye know that which restraineth, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v H22_7" data-id="H22_7">For the mystery of lawlessness doth already work: only <span class="add">there is </span> one that restraineth now, until he be taken out of the way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v H22_8" data-id="H22_8">And then shall be revealed the lawless one, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the breath of his mouth, and bring to nought by the manifestation of his coming; </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v H22_9" data-id="H22_9"> <span class="add">even he</span>, whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v H22_10" data-id="H22_10">and with all deceit of unrighteousness for them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v H22_11" data-id="H22_11">And for this cause God sendeth them a working of error, that they should believe a lie:</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v H22_12" data-id="H22_12">that they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v H22_13" data-id="H22_13">But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, for that God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v H22_14" data-id="H22_14">whereunto he called you through our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v H22_15" data-id="H22_15">So then, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye were taught, whether by word, or by epistle of ours.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v H22_16" data-id="H22_16">Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace, </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v H22_17" data-id="H22_17">comfort your hearts and establish them in every good work and word.</span>
