<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX5_1" data-id="EX5_1">And afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said unto Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX5_2" data-id="EX5_2">And Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah, that I should hearken unto his voice to let Israel go? I know not Jehovah, and moreover I will not let Israel go. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX5_3" data-id="EX5_3">And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice unto Jehovah our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX5_4" data-id="EX5_4">And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, loose the people from their works? get you unto your burdens. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX5_5" data-id="EX5_5">And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land are now many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX5_6" data-id="EX5_6">And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX5_7" data-id="EX5_7">Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX5_8" data-id="EX5_8">And the number of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof: for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX5_9" data-id="EX5_9">Let heavier work be laid upon the men, that they may labor therein; and let them not regard lying words.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX5_10" data-id="EX5_10">And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX5_11" data-id="EX5_11">Go yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it: for nought of your work shall be diminished.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX5_12" data-id="EX5_12">So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX5_13" data-id="EX5_13">And the taskmasters were urgent saying, Fulfil your works, <span class="add">your </span> daily tasks, as when there was straw. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX5_14" data-id="EX5_14">And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task both yesterday and to-day, in making brick as heretofore?</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX5_15" data-id="EX5_15">Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants? </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX5_16" data-id="EX5_16">There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX5_17" data-id="EX5_17">But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrifice to Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX5_18" data-id="EX5_18">Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the number of bricks.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX5_19" data-id="EX5_19">And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, when it was said, Ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks, <span class="add">your</span> daily tasks. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX5_20" data-id="EX5_20">And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX5_21" data-id="EX5_21">and they said unto them, Jehovah look upon you, and judge: because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX5_22" data-id="EX5_22">And Moses returned unto Jehovah, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou dealt ill with this people? why is it that thou hast sent me? </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX5_23" data-id="EX5_23">For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath dealt ill with this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all. </span>
