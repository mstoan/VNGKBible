<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV17_2" data-id="LV17_2">Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them: This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, saying, </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV17_3" data-id="LV17_3">What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it without the camp, </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV17_4" data-id="LV17_4">and hath not brought it unto the door of the tent of meeting, to offer it as an oblation unto Jehovah before the tabernacle of Jehovah: blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people: </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV17_5" data-id="LV17_5">to the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field, even that they may bring them unto Jehovah, unto the door of the tent of meeting, unto the priest, and sacrifice them for sacrifices of peace-offerings unto Jehovah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV17_6" data-id="LV17_6">And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting, and burn the fat for a sweet savor unto Jehovah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV17_7" data-id="LV17_7">And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the he-goats, after which they play the harlot. This shall be a statute forever unto them throughout their generations. </span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV17_11" data-id="LV17_11">For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh atonement by reason of the life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV17_12" data-id="LV17_12">Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood. </span>
