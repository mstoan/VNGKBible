<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_1" data-id="LV9_1">And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_2" data-id="LV9_2">and he said unto Aaron, Take thee a calf of the herd for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and offer them before Jehovah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_3" data-id="LV9_3">And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a he-goat for a sin-offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without blemish, for a burnt-offering; </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_4" data-id="LV9_4">and an ox and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before Jehovah; and a meal-offering mingled with oil: for to-day Jehovah appeareth unto you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_5" data-id="LV9_5">And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tent of meeting: and all the congregation drew near and stood before Jehovah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_6" data-id="LV9_6">And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah commanded that ye should do: and the glory of Jehovah shall appear unto you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_7" data-id="LV9_7">And Moses said unto Aaron, Draw near unto the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for the people; and offer the oblation of the people, and make atonement for them; as Jehovah commanded. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_8" data-id="LV9_8">So Aaron drew near unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin-offering, which was for himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_9" data-id="LV9_9">And the sons of Aaron presented the blood unto him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar: </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_10" data-id="LV9_10">but the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul from the liver of the sin-offering, he burnt upon the altar; as Jehovah commanded Moses. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_11" data-id="LV9_11">And the flesh and the skin he burnt with fire without the camp.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_12" data-id="LV9_12">And he slew the burnt-offering; and Aaron’s sons delivered unto him the blood, and he sprinkled it upon the altar round about. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_13" data-id="LV9_13">And they delivered the burnt-offering unto him, piece by piece, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_14" data-id="LV9_14">And he washed the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt-offering on the altar.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_15" data-id="LV9_15">And he presented the people’s oblation, and took the goat of the sin-offering which was for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_16" data-id="LV9_16">And he presented the burnt-offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_17" data-id="LV9_17">And he presented the meal-offering, and filled his hand therefrom, and burnt it upon the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning. </span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_18" data-id="LV9_18">He slew also the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron’s sons delivered unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_19" data-id="LV9_19">and the fat of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covereth <span class="add">the inwards</span>, and the kidneys, and the caul of the liver:</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_20" data-id="LV9_20">and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_21" data-id="LV9_21">and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave-offering before Jehovah; as Moses commanded.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_22" data-id="LV9_22">And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_23" data-id="LV9_23">And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of Jehovah appeared unto all the people. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV9_24" data-id="LV9_24">And there came forth fire from before Jehovah, and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fat: and when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces. </span>
