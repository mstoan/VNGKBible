<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_1" data-id="C110_1">For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_2" data-id="C110_2">and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_3" data-id="C110_3">and did all eat the same spiritual food;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_4" data-id="C110_4">and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was Christ. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_5" data-id="C110_5">Howbeit with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_6" data-id="C110_6">Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_7" data-id="C110_7">Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_8" data-id="C110_8">Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_9" data-id="C110_9">Neither let us make trial of the Lord, as some of them made trial, and perished by the serpents.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_10" data-id="C110_10">Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_11" data-id="C110_11">Now these things happened unto them by way of example; and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_12" data-id="C110_12">Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_13" data-id="C110_13">There hath no temptation taken you but such as man can bear: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_14" data-id="C110_14">Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_15" data-id="C110_15">I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_16" data-id="C110_16">The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a communion of the body of Christ? </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_17" data-id="C110_17">seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body: for we all partake of the one bread.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_18" data-id="C110_18">Behold Israel after the flesh: have not they that eat the sacrifices communion with the altar?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_19" data-id="C110_19">What say I then? that a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_20" data-id="C110_20">But <span class="add">I say</span>, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have communion with demons. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_21" data-id="C110_21">Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: ye cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_22" data-id="C110_22">Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_23" data-id="C110_23">All things are lawful; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful; but not all things edify.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_24" data-id="C110_24">Let no man seek his own, but <span class="add">each</span> his neighbor’s <span class="add">good</span>. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_25" data-id="C110_25">Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat, asking no question for conscience’ sake;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_26" data-id="C110_26">for the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_27" data-id="C110_27">If one of them that believe not biddeth you <span class="add">to a feast</span>, and ye are disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience’ sake. </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_28" data-id="C110_28">But if any man say unto you, This hath been offered in sacrifice, eat not, for his sake that showed it, and for conscience’ sake: </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_29" data-id="C110_29">conscience, I say, not thine own, but the other’s; for why is my liberty judged by another conscience?</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_30" data-id="C110_30">If I partake with thankfulness, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_31" data-id="C110_31">Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_32" data-id="C110_32">Give no occasion of stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God:</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_33" data-id="C110_33">even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the <span class="add">profit</span> of the many, that they may be saved. </span>
