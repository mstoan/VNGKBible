<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_1" data-id="HB4_1">Let us fear therefore, lest haply, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you should seem to have come short of it. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_2" data-id="HB4_2">For indeed we have had good tidings preached unto us, even as also they: but the word of hearing did not profit them, because it was not united by faith with them that heard. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_3" data-id="HB4_3">For we who have believed do enter into that rest; even as he hath said,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB4_3" data-id="HB4_3">As I sware in my wrath,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB4_3" data-id="HB4_3">They shall not enter into my rest:</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v HB4_3" data-id="HB4_3">although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_4" data-id="HB4_4">For he hath said somewhere of the seventh <span class="add">day</span> on this wise, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works; </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_5" data-id="HB4_5">and in this <span class="add">place</span> again,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB4_5" data-id="HB4_5">They shall not enter into my rest.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_6" data-id="HB4_6">Seeing therefore it remaineth that some should enter thereinto, and they to whom the good tidings were before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience, </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_7" data-id="HB4_7">he again defineth a certain day, To-day, saying in David so long a time afterward (even as hath been said before),</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB4_7" data-id="HB4_7">To-day if ye shall hear his voice,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB4_7" data-id="HB4_7">Harden not your hearts.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_8" data-id="HB4_8">For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_9" data-id="HB4_9">There remaineth therefore a sabbath rest for the people of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_10" data-id="HB4_10">For he that is entered into his rest hath himself also rested from his works, as God did from his.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_11" data-id="HB4_11">Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, that no man fall after the same example of disobedience.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_12" data-id="HB4_12">For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_13" data-id="HB4_13">And there is no creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_14" data-id="HB4_14">Having then a great high priest, who hath passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_15" data-id="HB4_15">For we have not a high priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but one that hath been in all points tempted like as <span class="add">we are, yet</span> without sin. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB4_16" data-id="HB4_16">Let us therefore draw near with boldness unto the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace to help <span class="add">us</span> in time of need. </span>
