<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_1" data-id="HB5_1">For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins: </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_2" data-id="HB5_2">who can bear gently with the ignorant and erring, for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_3" data-id="HB5_3">and by reason thereof is bound, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_4" data-id="HB5_4">And no man taketh the honor unto himself, but when he is called of God, even as was Aaron.</span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB5_8" data-id="HB5_8">though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered;</span>
