<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_1" data-id="PM1_1">Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_2" data-id="PM1_2">and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_3" data-id="PM1_3">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_4" data-id="PM1_4">I thank my God always, making mention of thee in my prayers,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_5" data-id="PM1_5">hearing of thy love, and of the faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_6" data-id="PM1_6">that the fellowship of thy faith may become effectual, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in you, unto Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_7" data-id="PM1_7">For I had much joy and comfort in thy love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_8" data-id="PM1_8">Wherefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to enjoin thee that which is befitting,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_9" data-id="PM1_9">yet for loveâ€™s sake I rather beseech, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_10" data-id="PM1_10">I beseech thee for my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_11" data-id="PM1_11">who once was unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable to thee and to me:</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_12" data-id="PM1_12">whom I have sent back to thee in his own person, that is, my very heart:</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_13" data-id="PM1_13">whom I would fain have kept with me, that in thy behalf he might minister unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_14" data-id="PM1_14">but without thy mind I would do nothing; that thy goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_15" data-id="PM1_15">For perhaps he was therefore parted <span class="add">from thee</span> for a season, that thou shouldest have him for ever;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_16" data-id="PM1_16">no longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_17" data-id="PM1_17">If then thou countest me a partner, receive him as myself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_18" data-id="PM1_18">But if he hath wronged thee at all, or oweth <span class="add">thee</span> aught, put that to mine account;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_19" data-id="PM1_19">I Paul write it with mine own hand, I will repay it: that I say not unto thee that thou owest to me even thine own self besides. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_20" data-id="PM1_20">Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_21" data-id="PM1_21">Having confidence in thine obedience I write unto thee, knowing that thou wilt do even beyond what I say.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_22" data-id="PM1_22">But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted unto you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_23" data-id="PM1_23">Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee;</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_24" data-id="PM1_24"> <span class="add">and so do</span> Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_25" data-id="PM1_25">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. </span>
