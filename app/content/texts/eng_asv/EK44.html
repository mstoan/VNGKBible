<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_6" data-id="EK44_6">And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations, </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK44_7" data-id="EK44_7">in that ye have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant, <span class="add">to add</span> unto all your abominations. </span>
