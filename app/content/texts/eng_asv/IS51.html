<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS51_1" data-id="IS51_1">Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek Jehovah: look unto the rock whence ye were hewn, and to the hold of the pit whence ye were digged. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS51_2" data-id="IS51_2">Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you; for when he was but one I called him, and I blessed him, and made him many. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS51_3" data-id="IS51_3">For Jehovah hath comforted Zion; he hath comforted all her waste places, and hath made her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of Jehovah; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS51_4" data-id="IS51_4">Attend unto me, O my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law shall go forth from me, and I will establish my justice for a light of the peoples. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS51_5" data-id="IS51_5">My righteousness is near, my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall judge the peoples; the isles shall wait for me, and on mine arm shall they trust. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS51_6" data-id="IS51_6">Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment; and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS51_7" data-id="IS51_7">Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye dismayed at their revilings. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS51_8" data-id="IS51_8">For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool; but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation unto all generations. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS51_9" data-id="IS51_9">Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of Jehovah; awake, as in the days of old, the generations of ancient times. Is it not thou that didst cut Rahab in pieces, that didst pierce the monster?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS51_10" data-id="IS51_10">Is it not thou that driedst up the sea, the waters of the great deep; that madest the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over? </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS51_11" data-id="IS51_11">And the ransomed of Jehovah shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads: they shall obtain gladness and joy; <span class="add">and</span> sorrow and sighing shall flee away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS51_12" data-id="IS51_12">I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou art afraid of man that shall die, and of the son of man that shall be made as grass; </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS51_13" data-id="IS51_13">and hast forgotten Jehovah thy Maker, that stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and fearest continually all the day because of the fury of the oppressor, when he maketh ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor? </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS51_14" data-id="IS51_14">The captive exile shall speedily be loosed; and he shall not die <span class="add">and go down</span> into the pit, neither shall his bread fail.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS51_15" data-id="IS51_15">For I am Jehovah thy God, who stirreth up the sea, so that the waves thereof roar: Jehovah of hosts is his name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS51_16" data-id="IS51_16">And I have put my words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the shadow of my hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS51_17" data-id="IS51_17">Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, that hast drunk at the hand of Jehovah the cup of his wrath; thou hast drunken the bowl of the cup of staggering, and drained it. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS51_18" data-id="IS51_18">There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand among all the sons that she hath brought up. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS51_19" data-id="IS51_19">These two things are befallen thee, who shall bemoan thee? desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword; how shall I comfort thee? </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS51_20" data-id="IS51_20">Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as an antelope in a net; they are full of the wrath of Jehovah, the rebuke of thy God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS51_21" data-id="IS51_21">Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS51_22" data-id="IS51_22">Thus saith thy Lord Jehovah, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thy hand the cup of staggering, even the bowl of the cup of my wrath; thou shalt no more drink it again:</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS51_23" data-id="IS51_23">and I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee, that have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over; and thou hast laid thy back as the ground, and as the street, to them that go over.</span>
