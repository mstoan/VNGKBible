<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_1" data-id="EP3_1">For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you Gentiles,—</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_2" data-id="EP3_2">if so be that ye have heard of the dispensation of that grace of God which was given me to you-ward;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_3" data-id="EP3_3">how that by revelation was made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote before in few words,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_4" data-id="EP3_4">whereby, when ye read, ye can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_5" data-id="EP3_5">which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit; </span>
