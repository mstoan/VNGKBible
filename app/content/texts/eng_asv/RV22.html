<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV22_2" data-id="RV22_2">in the midst of the street thereof.

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV22_8" data-id="RV22_8">And I John am he that heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel that showed me these things. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV22_9" data-id="RV22_9">And he saith unto me, See thou do it not: I am a fellow-servant with thee and with thy brethren the prophets, and with them that keep the words of this book: worship God. </span>
