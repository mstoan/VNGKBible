<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV22_1" data-id="RV22_1">And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV22_2" data-id="RV22_2">in the midst of the street thereof. And on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life, bearing twelve <span class="add">manner of</span> fruits, yielding its fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV22_3" data-id="RV22_3">And there shall be no curse any more: and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be therein: and his servants shall serve him;

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV22_8" data-id="RV22_8">And I John am he that heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel that showed me these things. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV22_9" data-id="RV22_9">And he saith unto me, See thou do it not: I am a fellow-servant with thee and with thy brethren the prophets, and with them that keep the words of this book: worship God.
