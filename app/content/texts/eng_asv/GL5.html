<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_1" data-id="GL5_1">For freedom did Christ set us free: stand fast therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_2" data-id="GL5_2">Behold, I Paul say unto you, that, if ye receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_3" data-id="GL5_3">Yea, I testify again to every man that receiveth circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_4" data-id="GL5_4">Ye are severed from Christ, ye who would be justified by the law; ye are fallen away from grace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_5" data-id="GL5_5">For we through the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_6" data-id="GL5_6">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_7" data-id="GL5_7">Ye were running well; who hindered you that ye should not obey the truth?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_8" data-id="GL5_8">This persuasion <span class="add">came</span> not of him that calleth you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_9" data-id="GL5_9">A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_10" data-id="GL5_10">I have confidence to you-ward in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_11" data-id="GL5_11">But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been done away. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_12" data-id="GL5_12">I would that they that unsettle you would even go beyond circumcision.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_13" data-id="GL5_13">For ye, brethren, were called for freedom; only <span class="add">use</span> not your freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through love be servants one to another. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_14" data-id="GL5_14">For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, <span class="add">even</span> in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_15" data-id="GL5_15">But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_16" data-id="GL5_16">But I say, Walk by the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_17" data-id="GL5_17">For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other; that ye may not do the things that ye would. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_18" data-id="GL5_18">But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_19" data-id="GL5_19">Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are <span class="add">these</span>: fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_20" data-id="GL5_20">idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousies, wraths, factions, divisions, parties,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_21" data-id="GL5_21">envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like; of which I forewarn you, even as I did forewarn you, that they who practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_22" data-id="GL5_22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_23" data-id="GL5_23">meekness, self-control; against such there is no law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_24" data-id="GL5_24">And they that are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_25" data-id="GL5_25">If we live by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us also walk.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL5_26" data-id="GL5_26">Let us not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another.</span>
