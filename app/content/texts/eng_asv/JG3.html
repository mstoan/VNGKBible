<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_1" data-id="JG3_1">Now these are the nations which Jehovah left, to prove Israel by them, even as many <span class="add">of Israel</span> as had not known all the wars of Canaan; </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_2" data-id="JG3_2">only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as beforetime knew nothing thereof: </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_3" data-id="JG3_3"> <span class="add">namely</span>, the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entrance of Hamath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_4" data-id="JG3_4">And they were <span class="add">left</span>, to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah, which he commanded their fathers by Moses. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_5" data-id="JG3_5">And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites: </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_6" data-id="JG3_6">and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_7" data-id="JG3_7">And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and forgat Jehovah their God, and served the Baalim and the Asheroth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_8" data-id="JG3_8">Therefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_9" data-id="JG3_9">And when the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah, Jehovah raised up a saviour to the children of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Calebâ€™s younger brother. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_10" data-id="JG3_10">And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Jehovah delivered Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand: and his hand prevailed against Cushan-rishathaim.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_11" data-id="JG3_11">And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_12" data-id="JG3_12">And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and Jehovah strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_13" data-id="JG3_13">And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and smote Israel, and they possessed the city of palm-trees. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_14" data-id="JG3_14">And the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_15" data-id="JG3_15">But when the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah, Jehovah raised them up a saviour, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a man left-handed. And the children of Israel sent tribute by him unto Eglon the king of Moab.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_16" data-id="JG3_16">And Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_17" data-id="JG3_17">And he offered the tribute unto Eglon king of Moab: now Eglon was a very fat man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_18" data-id="JG3_18">And when he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away the people that bare the tribute.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_19" data-id="JG3_19">But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king. And he said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_20" data-id="JG3_20">And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_21" data-id="JG3_21">And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body:</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_22" data-id="JG3_22">and the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, for he drew not the sword out of his body; and it came out behind. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_23" data-id="JG3_23">Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room upon him, and locked them.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_24" data-id="JG3_24">Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw, and, behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; and they said, Surely he is covering his feet in the upper chamber. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_25" data-id="JG3_25">And they tarried till they were ashamed; and, behold, he opened not the doors of the upper room: therefore they took the key, and opened <span class="add">them</span>; and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_26" data-id="JG3_26">And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_27" data-id="JG3_27">And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill-country, and he before them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_28" data-id="JG3_28">And he said unto them, Follow after me; for Jehovah hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and suffered not a man to pass over.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_29" data-id="JG3_29">And they smote of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valor; and there escaped not a man. </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_30" data-id="JG3_30">So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG3_31" data-id="JG3_31">And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who smote of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad: and he also saved Israel. </span>
