<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS15_1" data-id="IS15_1">The burden of Moab. For in a night Ar of Moab is laid waste, <span class="add">and </span> brought to nought; for in a night Kir of Moab is laid waste, <span class="add">and </span> brought to nought. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS15_2" data-id="IS15_2">They are gone up to Bayith, and to Dibon, to the high places, to weep: Moab waileth over Nebo, and over Medeba; on all their heads is baldness, every beard is cut off. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS15_3" data-id="IS15_3">In their streets they gird themselves with sackcloth; on their housetops, and in their broad places, every one waileth, weeping abundantly. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS15_4" data-id="IS15_4">And Heshbon crieth out, and Elealeh; their voice is heard even unto Jahaz: therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud; his soul trembleth within him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS15_5" data-id="IS15_5">My heart crieth out for Moab; her nobles <span class="add">flee</span> unto Zoar, to Eglath-shelishi-yah: for by the ascent of Luhith with weeping they go up; for in the way of Horonaim they raise up a cry of destruction.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS15_6" data-id="IS15_6">For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate; for the grass is withered away, the tender grass faileth, there is no green thing. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS15_7" data-id="IS15_7">Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away over the brook of the willows. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS15_8" data-id="IS15_8">For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the wailing thereof unto Eglaim, and the wailing thereof unto Beer-elim. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS15_9" data-id="IS15_9">For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; for I will bring yet more upon Dimon, a lion upon them of Moab that escape, and upon the remnant of the land. </span>
