<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_1" data-id="HS4_1">Hear the word of Jehovah, ye children of Israel; for Jehovah hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor goodness, nor knowledge of God in the land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_2" data-id="HS4_2">There is nought but swearing and breaking faith, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery; they break out, and blood toucheth blood. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_3" data-id="HS4_3">Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_4" data-id="HS4_4">Yet let no man strive, neither let any man reprove; for thy people are as they that strive with the priest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_5" data-id="HS4_5">And thou shalt stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night; and I will destroy thy mother. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_6" data-id="HS4_6">My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_7" data-id="HS4_7">As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_8" data-id="HS4_8">They feed on the sin of my people, and set their heart on their iniquity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_9" data-id="HS4_9">And it shall be, like people, like priest; and I will punish them for their ways, and will requite them their doings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_10" data-id="HS4_10">And they shall eat, and not have enough; they shall play the harlot, and shall not increase; because they have left off taking heed to Jehovah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_11" data-id="HS4_11">Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the understanding.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_12" data-id="HS4_12">My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declareth unto them; for the spirit of whoredom hath caused them to err, and they have played the harlot, <span class="add">departing</span> from under their God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_13" data-id="HS4_13">They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters play the harlot, and your brides commit adultery.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_14" data-id="HS4_14">I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot, nor your brides when they commit adultery; for <span class="add">the men</span> themselves go apart with harlots, and they sacrifice with the prostitutes; and the people that doth not understand shall be overthrown. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_15" data-id="HS4_15">Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, As Jehovah liveth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_16" data-id="HS4_16">For Israel hath behaved himself stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer: now will Jehovah feed them as a lamb in a large place. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_17" data-id="HS4_17">Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_18" data-id="HS4_18">Their drink is become sour; they play the harlot continually; her rulers dearly love shame.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS4_19" data-id="HS4_19">The wind hath wrapped her up in its wings; and they shall be put to shame because of their sacrifices.</span>
