<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_1" data-id="TT3_1">Put them in mind to be in subjection to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_2" data-id="TT3_2">to speak evil of no man, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all meekness toward all men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_3" data-id="TT3_3">For we also once were foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_4" data-id="TT3_4">But when the kindness of God our Saviour, and his love toward man, appeared,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_5" data-id="TT3_5">not by works <span class="add">done</span> in righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_6" data-id="TT3_6">which he poured out upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_7" data-id="TT3_7">that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</span>

These things are good and profitable unto men:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_9" data-id="TT3_9">but shun foolish questionings, and genealogies, and strifes, and fightings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. </span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_11" data-id="TT3_11">knowing that such a one is perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_12" data-id="TT3_12">When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, give diligence to come unto me to Nicopolis: for there I have determined to winter. </span>
