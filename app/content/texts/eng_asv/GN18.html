<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_1" data-id="GN18_1">And Jehovah appeared unto him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_2" data-id="GN18_2">and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood over against him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth, </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_3" data-id="GN18_3">and said, My lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_4" data-id="GN18_4">let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_5" data-id="GN18_5">and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and strengthen ye your heart; after that ye shall pass on: forasmuch as ye are come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_6" data-id="GN18_6">And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_7" data-id="GN18_7">And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto the servant; and he hasted to dress it. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_8" data-id="GN18_8">And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat. </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_9" data-id="GN18_9">And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_10" data-id="GN18_10">And he said, I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_11" data-id="GN18_11">Now Abraham and Sarah were old, <span class="add">and</span> well stricken in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_12" data-id="GN18_12">And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_13" data-id="GN18_13">And Jehovah said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, who am old?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_14" data-id="GN18_14">Is anything too hard for Jehovah? At the set time I will return unto thee, when the season cometh round, and Sarah shall have a son. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_15" data-id="GN18_15">Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_17" data-id="GN18_17">And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_18" data-id="GN18_18">seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_19" data-id="GN18_19">For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_20" data-id="GN18_20">And Jehovah said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_21" data-id="GN18_21">I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know. </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_22" data-id="GN18_22">And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_23" data-id="GN18_23">And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou consume the righteous with the wicked?</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_24" data-id="GN18_24">Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein? </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_25" data-id="GN18_25">That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from thee: shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_26" data-id="GN18_26">And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_27" data-id="GN18_27">And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, who am but dust and ashes:</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_28" data-id="GN18_28">peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five. </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_29" data-id="GN18_29">And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty’s sake. </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_30" data-id="GN18_30">And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there. </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_31" data-id="GN18_31">And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the twenty’s sake. </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_32" data-id="GN18_32">And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten’s sake. </span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN18_33" data-id="GN18_33">And Jehovah went his way, as soon as he had left off communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.</span>
