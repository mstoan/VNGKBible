<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT15_1" data-id="DT15_1">At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT15_2" data-id="DT15_2">And this is the manner of the release: every creditor shall release that which he hath lent unto his neighbor; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother; because Jehovahâ€™s release hath been proclaimed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT15_3" data-id="DT15_3">Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it: but whatsoever of thine is with thy brother thy hand shall release.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT15_4" data-id="DT15_4">Howbeit there shall be no poor with thee (for Jehovah will surely bless thee in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it), </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT15_5" data-id="DT15_5">if only thou diligently hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God, to observe to do all this commandment which I command thee this day. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT15_6" data-id="DT15_6">For Jehovah thy God will bless thee, as he promised thee: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt rule over many nations, but they shall not rule over thee.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT15_7" data-id="DT15_7">If there be with thee a poor man, one of thy brethren, within any of thy gates in thy land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thy heart, nor shut thy hand from thy poor brother;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT15_8" data-id="DT15_8">but thou shalt surely open thy hand unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need <span class="add">in that</span> which he wanteth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT15_9" data-id="DT15_9">Beware that there be not a base thought in thy heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou give him nought; and he cry unto Jehovah against thee, and it be sin unto thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT15_10" data-id="DT15_10">Thou shalt surely give him, and thy heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him; because that for this thing Jehovah thy God will bless thee in all thy work, and in all that thou puttest thy hand unto.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT15_11" data-id="DT15_11">For the poor will never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt surely open thy hand unto thy brother, to thy needy, and to thy poor, in thy land. </span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT15_13" data-id="DT15_13">And when thou lettest him go free from thee, thou shalt not let him go empty:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT15_14" data-id="DT15_14">thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy threshing-floor, and out of thy winepress; as Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT15_15" data-id="DT15_15">And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing to-day. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT15_16" data-id="DT15_16">And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go out from thee; because he loveth thee and thy house, because he is well with thee; </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT15_17" data-id="DT15_17">then thou shalt take an awl, and thrust it through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy maid-servant thou shalt do likewise. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT15_18" data-id="DT15_18">It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou lettest him go free from thee; for to the double of the hire of a hireling hath he served thee six years: and Jehovah thy God will bless thee in all that thou doest.</span>

<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT15_20" data-id="DT15_20">Thou shalt eat it before Jehovah thy God year by year in the place which Jehovah shall choose, thou and thy household.</span>
