<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_18" data-id="S211_18">Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_19" data-id="S211_19">and he charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling all the things concerning the war unto the king, </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_20" data-id="S211_20">it shall be that, if the king’s wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore went ye so nigh unto the city to fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall? </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_21" data-id="S211_21">who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast an upper millstone upon him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? why went ye so nigh the wall? then shalt thou say, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v S211_22" data-id="S211_22">So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.</span>
