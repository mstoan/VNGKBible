<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_2" data-id="NU18_2">And thy brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall be before the tent of the testimony.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_3" data-id="NU18_3">And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the Tent: only they shall not come nigh unto the vessels of the sanctuary and unto the altar, that they die not, neither they, nor ye.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_4" data-id="NU18_4">And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the Tent: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_5" data-id="NU18_5">And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar; that there be wrath no more upon the children of Israel. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_6" data-id="NU18_6">And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are a gift, given unto Jehovah, to do the service of the tent of meeting. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_7" data-id="NU18_7">And thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that within the veil; and ye shall serve: I give you the priesthood as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_9" data-id="NU18_9">This shall be thine of the most holy things, <span class="add">reserved</span> from the fire: every oblation of theirs, even every meal-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every trespass-offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_10" data-id="NU18_10">As the most holy things shalt thou eat thereof; every male shall eat thereof: it shall be holy unto thee.</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_12" data-id="NU18_12">All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first-fruits of them which they give unto Jehovah, to thee have I given them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_13" data-id="NU18_13">The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring unto Jehovah, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof. </span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_16" data-id="NU18_16">And those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the same is twenty gerahs).</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_17" data-id="NU18_17">But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savor unto Jehovah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_18" data-id="NU18_18">And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave-breast and as the right thigh, it shall be thine.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_19" data-id="NU18_19">All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto Jehovah, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, as a portion for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before Jehovah unto thee and to thy seed with thee. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_20" data-id="NU18_20">And Jehovah said unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any portion among them: I am thy portion and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.</span>

<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_21" data-id="NU18_21">And unto the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_22" data-id="NU18_22">And henceforth the children of Israel shall not come nigh the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_23" data-id="NU18_23">But the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations; and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_24" data-id="NU18_24">For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a heave-offering unto Jehovah, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_25" data-id="NU18_25">And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_26" data-id="NU18_26">Moreover thou shalt speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up a heave-offering of it for Jehovah, a tithe of the tithe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_27" data-id="NU18_27">And your heave-offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the grain of the threshing-floor, and as the fulness of the winepress. </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_28" data-id="NU18_28">Thus ye also shall offer a heave-offering unto Jehovah of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and thereof ye shall give Jehovah’s heave-offering to Aaron the priest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_29" data-id="NU18_29">Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave-offering of Jehovah, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it. </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_30" data-id="NU18_30">Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye heave the best thereof from it, then it shall be reckoned unto the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the wine-press.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_31" data-id="NU18_31">And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting. </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU18_32" data-id="NU18_32">And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best thereof: and ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that ye die not. </span>
