<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU8_7" data-id="NU8_7">And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of expiation upon them, and let them cause a razor to pass over all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU8_8" data-id="NU8_8">Then let them take a young bullock, and its meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil; and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin-offering. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU8_9" data-id="NU8_9">And thou shalt present the Levites before the tent of meeting: and thou shalt assemble the whole congregation of the children of Israel: </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU8_10" data-id="NU8_10">and thou shalt present the Levites before Jehovah. And the children of Israel shall lay their hands upon the Levites:</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU8_14" data-id="NU8_14">Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU8_16" data-id="NU8_16">For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of all that openeth the womb, even the first-born of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU8_17" data-id="NU8_17">For all the first-born among the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself. </span>

<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU8_25" data-id="NU8_25">and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the work, and shall serve no more,</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU8_26" data-id="NU8_26">but shall minister with their brethren in the tent of meeting, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charges. </span>
