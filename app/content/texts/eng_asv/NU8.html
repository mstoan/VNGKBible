<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU8_7" data-id="NU8_7">And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of expiation upon them, and let them cause a razor to pass over all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU8_8" data-id="NU8_8">Then let them take a young bullock, and its meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil; and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin-offering. </span>
