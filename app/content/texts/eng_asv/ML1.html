<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_1" data-id="ML1_1">The burden of the word of Jehovah to Israel by Malachi.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_2" data-id="ML1_2">I have loved you, saith Jehovah. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob’s brother, saith Jehovah: yet I loved Jacob; </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_3" data-id="ML1_3">but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and <span class="add">gave </span> his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_4" data-id="ML1_4">Whereas Edom saith, We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places; thus saith Jehovah of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and men shall call them The border of wickedness, and The people against whom Jehovah hath indignation for ever. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_5" data-id="ML1_5">And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, Jehovah be magnified beyond the border of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_6" data-id="ML1_6">A son honoreth his father, and a servant his master: if then I am a father, where is mine honor? and if I am a master, where is my fear? saith Jehovah of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name? </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_7" data-id="ML1_7">Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar. And ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of Jehovah is contemptible. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_8" data-id="ML1_8">And when ye offer the blind for sacrifice, it is no evil! and when ye offer the lame and sick, it is no evil! Present it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee? or will he accept thy person? saith Jehovah of hosts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_9" data-id="ML1_9">And now, I pray you, entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he accept any of your persons? saith Jehovah of hosts. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_10" data-id="ML1_10">Oh that there were one among you that would shut the doors, that ye might not kindle <span class="add">fire on</span> mine altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, saith Jehovah of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_11" data-id="ML1_11">For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name <span class="add">shall be</span> great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense <span class="add">shall be</span> offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name <span class="add">shall be</span> great among the Gentiles, saith Jehovah of hosts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_12" data-id="ML1_12">But ye profane it, in that ye say, The table of Jehovah is polluted, and the fruit thereof, even its food, is contemptible. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_13" data-id="ML1_13">Ye say also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith Jehovah of hosts; and ye have brought that which was taken by violence, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye bring the offering: should I accept this at your hand? saith Jehovah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ML1_14" data-id="ML1_14">But cursed be the deceiver, who hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a blemished thing; for I am a great King, saith Jehovah of hosts, and my name is terrible among the Gentiles.</span>
