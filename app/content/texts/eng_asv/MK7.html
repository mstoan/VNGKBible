<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_1" data-id="MK7_1">And there are gathered together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, who had come from Jerusalem,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_2" data-id="MK7_2">and had seen that some of his disciples ate their bread with defiled, that is, unwashen, hands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_3" data-id="MK7_3">(For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands diligently, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders; </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_4" data-id="MK7_4">and <span class="add">when they come</span> from the marketplace, except they bathe themselves, they eat not; and many other things there are, which they have received to hold, washings of cups, and pots, and brasen vessels.)</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_5" data-id="MK7_5">And the Pharisees and the scribes ask him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with defiled hands? </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_6" data-id="MK7_6">And he said unto them, Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,</span>

<span class="v MK7_6" data-id="MK7_6">This people honoreth me with their lips,</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_9" data-id="MK7_9">And he said unto them, Full well do ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your tradition.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_10" data-id="MK7_10">For Moses said, Honor thy father and thy mother; and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_11" data-id="MK7_11">but ye say, If a man shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is Corban, that is to say, Given <span class="add">to God</span>; </span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_14" data-id="MK7_14">And he called to him the multitude again, and said unto them, Hear me all of you, and understand:</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_15" data-id="MK7_15">there is nothing from without the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man. </span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_18" data-id="MK7_18">And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Perceive ye not, that whatsoever from without goeth into the man, <span class="add">it</span> cannot defile him; </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_19" data-id="MK7_19">because it goeth not into his heart, but into his belly, and goeth out into the draught? <span class="add">This he said</span>, making all meats clean. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_20" data-id="MK7_20">And he said, That which proceedeth out of the man, that defileth the man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_21" data-id="MK7_21">For from within, out of the heart of men, evil thoughts proceed, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_22" data-id="MK7_22">covetings, wickednesses, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, railing, pride, foolishness:</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_23" data-id="MK7_23">all these evil things proceed from within, and defile the man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_24" data-id="MK7_24">And from thence he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered into a house, and would have no man know it; and he could not be hid. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_25" data-id="MK7_25">But straightway a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_26" data-id="MK7_26">Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. And she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_27" data-id="MK7_27">And he said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs. </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_28" data-id="MK7_28">But she answered and saith unto him, Yea, Lord; even the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_29" data-id="MK7_29">And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the demon is gone out of thy daughter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_30" data-id="MK7_30">And she went away unto her house, and found the child laid upon the bed, and the demon gone out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_31" data-id="MK7_31">And again he went out from the borders of Tyre, and came through Sidon unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis. </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_32" data-id="MK7_32">And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to lay his hand upon him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_33" data-id="MK7_33">And he took him aside from the multitude privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue; </span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_34" data-id="MK7_34">and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_35" data-id="MK7_35">And his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_36" data-id="MK7_36">And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it. </span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK7_37" data-id="MK7_37">And they were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well; he maketh even the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak. </span>
