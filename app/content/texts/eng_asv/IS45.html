<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS45_2" data-id="IS45_2">I will go before thee, and make the rough places smooth; I will break in pieces the doors of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron; </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS45_3" data-id="IS45_3">and I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that it is I, Jehovah, who call thee by thy name, even the God of Israel. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS45_4" data-id="IS45_4">For Jacob my servantâ€™s sake, and Israel my chosen, I have called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me. </span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS45_7" data-id="IS45_7">I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil. I am Jehovah, that doeth all these things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS45_8" data-id="IS45_8">Distil, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, that it may bring forth salvation, and let it cause righteousness to spring up together; I, Jehovah, have created it.</span>

<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS45_19" data-id="IS45_19">I have not spoken in secret, in a place of the land of darkness; I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I, Jehovah, speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS45_20" data-id="IS45_20">Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.</span>
