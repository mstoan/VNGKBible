<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_1" data-id="LK23_1">And the whole company of them rose up, and brought him before Pilate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_2" data-id="LK23_2">And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cæsar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_3" data-id="LK23_3">And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_4" data-id="LK23_4">And Pilate said unto the chief priests and the multitudes, I find no fault in this man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_5" data-id="LK23_5">But they were the more urgent, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judæa, and beginning from Galilee even unto this place. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_6" data-id="LK23_6">But when Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man were a Galilæan.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_7" data-id="LK23_7">And when he knew that he was of Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him unto Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in these days. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_8" data-id="LK23_8">Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was of a long time desirous to see him, because he had heard concerning him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_9" data-id="LK23_9">And he questioned him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_10" data-id="LK23_10">And the chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_11" data-id="LK23_11">And Herod with his soldiers set him at nought, and mocked him, and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to Pilate. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_12" data-id="LK23_12">And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_13" data-id="LK23_13">And Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_14" data-id="LK23_14">and said unto them, Ye brought unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people: and behold, I, having examined him before you, found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_15" data-id="LK23_15">no, nor yet Herod: for he sent him back unto us; and behold, nothing worthy of death hath been done by him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_16" data-id="LK23_16">I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_18" data-id="LK23_18">But they cried out all together, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:—</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_19" data-id="LK23_19">one who for a certain insurrection made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_20" data-id="LK23_20">And Pilate spake unto them again, desiring to release Jesus;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_21" data-id="LK23_21">but they shouted, saying, Crucify, crucify him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_22" data-id="LK23_22">And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath this man done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him and release him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_23" data-id="LK23_23">But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. And their voices prevailed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_24" data-id="LK23_24">And Pilate gave sentence that what they asked for should be done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_25" data-id="LK23_25">And he released him that for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_26" data-id="LK23_26">And when they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to bear it after Jesus. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_27" data-id="LK23_27">And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_28" data-id="LK23_28">But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_29" data-id="LK23_29">For behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the breasts that never gave suck. </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_30" data-id="LK23_30">Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_31" data-id="LK23_31">For if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_32" data-id="LK23_32">And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_33" data-id="LK23_33">And when they came unto the place which is called The skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand and the other on the left. </span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_34" data-id="LK23_34">And Jesus said, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And parting his garments among them, they cast lots. </span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_35" data-id="LK23_35">And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also scoffed at him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen. </span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_36" data-id="LK23_36">And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, offering him vinegar,</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_37" data-id="LK23_37">and saying, If thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_38" data-id="LK23_38">And there was also a superscription over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_39" data-id="LK23_39">And one of the malefactors that were hanged railed on him, saying, Art not thou the Christ? save thyself and us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_40" data-id="LK23_40">But the other answered, and rebuking him said, Dost thou not even fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_41" data-id="LK23_41">And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_42" data-id="LK23_42">And he said, Jesus, remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_43" data-id="LK23_43">And he said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_44" data-id="LK23_44">And it was now about the sixth hour, and a darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour,</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_45" data-id="LK23_45">the sun’s light failing: and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_46" data-id="LK23_46">And Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said this, he gave up the ghost. </span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_47" data-id="LK23_47">And when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_48" data-id="LK23_48">And all the multitudes that came together to this sight, when they beheld the things that were done, returned smiting their breasts. </span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_49" data-id="LK23_49">And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed with him from Galilee, stood afar off, seeing these things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_50" data-id="LK23_50">And behold, a man named Joseph, who was a councillor, a good and righteous man</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_51" data-id="LK23_51">(he had not consented to their counsel and deed), <span class="add">a man</span> of Arimathæa, a city of the Jews, who was looking for the kingdom of God: </span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_52" data-id="LK23_52">this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_53" data-id="LK23_53">And he took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was hewn in stone, where never man had yet lain. </span>
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_54" data-id="LK23_54">And it was the day of the Preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</span>
<span class="v-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_55" data-id="LK23_55">And the women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and beheld the tomb, and how his body was laid.</span>
<span class="v-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v LK23_56" data-id="LK23_56">And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments. And on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</span>
