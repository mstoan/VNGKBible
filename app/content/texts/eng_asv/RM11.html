<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_1" data-id="RM11_1">I say then, Did God cast off his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_2" data-id="RM11_2">God did not cast off his people which he foreknew. Or know ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah? how he pleadeth with God against Israel: </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_3" data-id="RM11_3">Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_4" data-id="RM11_4">But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have left for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_5" data-id="RM11_5">Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_6" data-id="RM11_6">But if it is by grace, it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_7" data-id="RM11_7">What then? That which Israel seeketh for, that he obtained not; but the election obtained it, and the rest were hardened:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_8" data-id="RM11_8">according as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this very day. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_9" data-id="RM11_9">And David saith,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM11_9" data-id="RM11_9">Let their table be made a snare, and a trap,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM11_9" data-id="RM11_9">And a stumblingblock, and a recompense unto them:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_10" data-id="RM11_10">Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM11_10" data-id="RM11_10">And bow thou down their back always.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_11" data-id="RM11_11">I say then, Did they stumble that they might fall? God forbid: but by their fall salvation <span class="add">is come</span> unto the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_12" data-id="RM11_12">Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_13" data-id="RM11_13">But I speak to you that are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_14" data-id="RM11_14">if by any means I may provoke to jealousy <span class="add">them that are</span> my flesh, and may save some of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_15" data-id="RM11_15">For if the casting away of them <span class="add">is</span> the reconciling of the world, what <span class="add">shall</span> the receiving <span class="add">of them be</span>, but life from the dead?</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_16" data-id="RM11_16">And if the firstfruit is holy, so is the lump: and if the root is holy, so are the branches.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_17" data-id="RM11_17">But if some of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive, wast grafted in among them, and didst become partaker with them of the root of the fatness of the olive tree;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_18" data-id="RM11_18">glory not over the branches: but if thou gloriest, it is not thou that bearest the root, but the root thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_19" data-id="RM11_19">Thou wilt say then, Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_20" data-id="RM11_20">Well; by their unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by thy faith. Be not highminded, but fear:</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_21" data-id="RM11_21">for if God spared not the natural branches, neither will he spare thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_22" data-id="RM11_22">Behold then the goodness and severity of God: toward them that fell, severity; but toward thee, God’s goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_23" data-id="RM11_23">And they also, if they continue not in their unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_24" data-id="RM11_24">For if thou wast cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and wast grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how much more shall these, which are the natural <span class="add">branches</span>, be grafted into their own olive tree?</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_25" data-id="RM11_25">For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant of this mystery, lest ye be wise in your own conceits, that a hardening in part hath befallen Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in;</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_26" data-id="RM11_26">and so all Israel shall be saved: even as it is written,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM11_26" data-id="RM11_26">There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer;</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM11_26" data-id="RM11_26">He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_27" data-id="RM11_27">And this is my covenant unto them,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM11_27" data-id="RM11_27">When I shall take away their sins.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_28" data-id="RM11_28">As touching the gospel, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sake. </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_29" data-id="RM11_29">For the gifts and the calling of God are not repented of.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_30" data-id="RM11_30">For as ye in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_31" data-id="RM11_31">even so have these also now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they also may now obtain mercy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_32" data-id="RM11_32">For God hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_33" data-id="RM11_33">O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out! </span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_34" data-id="RM11_34">For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_35" data-id="RM11_35">or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_36" data-id="RM11_36">For of him, and through him, and unto him, are all things. To him <span class="add">be</span> the glory for ever. Amen. </span>
