<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_7" data-id="EK22_7">In thee have they set light by father and mother; in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the sojourner; in thee have they wronged the fatherless and the widow. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_8" data-id="EK22_8">Thou hast despised my holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_9" data-id="EK22_9">Slanderous men have been in thee to shed blood; and in thee they have eaten upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they have committed lewdness. </span>

<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_25" data-id="EK22_25">There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey: they have devoured souls; they take treasure and precious things; they have made her widows many in the midst thereof.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_26" data-id="EK22_26">Her priests have done violence to my law, and have profaned my holy things: they have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they caused men to discern between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_27" data-id="EK22_27">Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, <span class="add">and</span> to destroy souls, that they may get dishonest gain.</span>

<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_29" data-id="EK22_29">The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery; yea, they have vexed the poor and needy, and have oppressed the sojourner wrongfully. </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_30" data-id="EK22_30">And I sought for a man among them, that should build up the wall, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found none. </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK22_31" data-id="EK22_31">Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I brought upon their heads, saith the Lord Jehovah. </span>
