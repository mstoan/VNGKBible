<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_7" data-id="K122_7">But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we may inquire of him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_8" data-id="K122_8">And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah, Micaiah the son of Imlah: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_9" data-id="K122_9">Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_13" data-id="K122_13">And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets <span class="add">declare</span> good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak thou good. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_14" data-id="K122_14">And Micaiah said, As Jehovah liveth, what Jehovah saith unto me, that will I speak.</span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_18" data-id="K122_18">And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_19" data-id="K122_19">And <span class="add">Micaiah</span> said, Therefore hear thou the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_20" data-id="K122_20">And Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner; and another said on that manner. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_21" data-id="K122_21">And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him.</span>

<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_25" data-id="K122_25">And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_26" data-id="K122_26">And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the kingâ€™s son; </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_27" data-id="K122_27">and say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace. </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_28" data-id="K122_28">And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, Jehovah hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, ye peoples, all of you. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_29" data-id="K122_29">So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_30" data-id="K122_30">And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_31" data-id="K122_31">Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty and two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel. </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_32" data-id="K122_32">And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel; and they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_33" data-id="K122_33">And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_34" data-id="K122_34">And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_35" data-id="K122_35">And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even; and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot. </span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_36" data-id="K122_36">And there went a cry throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his country. </span>

<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_43" data-id="K122_43">And he walked in all the way of Asa his father; He turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah: howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_44" data-id="K122_44">And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</span>
