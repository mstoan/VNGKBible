<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_2" data-id="K122_2">And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_3" data-id="K122_3">And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth-gilead is ours, and we are still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?

<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_4" data-id="K122_4">And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_5" data-id="K122_5">And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire first, I pray thee, for the word of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_6" data-id="K122_6">Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.
</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_7" data-id="K122_7">But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we may inquire of him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_8" data-id="K122_8">And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah, Micaiah the son of Imlah: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_9" data-id="K122_9">Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_10" data-id="K122_10">Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_13" data-id="K122_13">And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets <span class="add">declare</span> good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak thou
 good. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_14" data-id="K122_14">And Micaiah said, As Jehovah liveth, what Jehovah saith unto me, that will I speak.</span>

</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_16" data-id="K122_16">And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah?

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_17" data-id="K122_17">And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Jehovah said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_18" data-id="K122_18">And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_19" data-id="K122_19">And <span class="add">Micaiah</span> said, Therefore hear thou the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.
</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_20" data-id="K122_20">And Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner; and another said on that manner. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_21" data-id="K122_21">And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_22" data-id="K122_22">And Jehovah said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also: go forth, and do so.
</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_23" data-id="K122_23">Now therefore, behold, Jehovah hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets; and Jehovah hath spoken evil concerning thee.

</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_25" data-id="K122_25">And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_26" data-id="K122_26">And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son; 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_27" data-id="K122_27">and say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.

<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_28" data-id="K122_28">And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, Jehovah hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, ye peoples, all of you.

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_29" data-id="K122_29">So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_30" data-id="K122_30">And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_31" data-id="K122_31">Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty and two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_32" data-id="K122_32">And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel; and they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.
</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_33" data-id="K122_33">And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.

<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_34" data-id="K122_34">And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded.
</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_35" data-id="K122_35">And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even; and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.

</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v K122_44" data-id="K122_44">And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</span>
