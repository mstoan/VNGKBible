<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_2" data-id="DT29_2">And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have seen all that Jehovah did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_3" data-id="DT29_3">the great trials which thine eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_4" data-id="DT29_4">but Jehovah hath not given you a heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_5" data-id="DT29_5">And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxed old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxed old upon thy foot. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_6" data-id="DT29_6">Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink; that ye may know that I am Jehovah your God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_7" data-id="DT29_7">And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them: </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_8" data-id="DT29_8">and we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of the Manassites. </span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_10" data-id="DT29_10">Ye stand this day all of you before Jehovah your God; your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers, even all the men of Israel, </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_11" data-id="DT29_11">your little ones, your wives, and thy sojourner that is in the midst of thy camps, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water; </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_12" data-id="DT29_12">that thou mayest enter into the covenant of Jehovah thy God, and into his oath, which Jehovah thy God maketh with thee this day; </span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_18" data-id="DT29_18">lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from Jehovah our God, to go to serve the gods of those nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_19" data-id="DT29_19">and it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart, to destroy the moist with the dry.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_20" data-id="DT29_20">Jehovah will not pardon him, but then the anger of Jehovah and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book shall lie upon him, and Jehovah will blot out his name from under heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_21" data-id="DT29_21">And Jehovah will set him apart unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this book of the law. </span>

<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_23" data-id="DT29_23"> <span class="add">and that</span> the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, <span class="add">and</span> a burning, <span class="add">that</span> it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which Jehovah overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_24" data-id="DT29_24">even all the nations shall say, Wherefore hath Jehovah done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger? </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_25" data-id="DT29_25">Then men shall say, Because they forsook the covenant of Jehovah, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_26" data-id="DT29_26">and went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods that they knew not, and that he had not given unto them:</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_27" data-id="DT29_27">therefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curse that is written in this book; </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_28" data-id="DT29_28">and Jehovah rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as at this day. </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT29_29" data-id="DT29_29">The secret things belong unto Jehovah our God; but the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law. </span>
