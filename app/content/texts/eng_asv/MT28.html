<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_2" data-id="MT28_2">And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and sat upon it. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_3" data-id="MT28_3">His appearance was as lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_4" data-id="MT28_4">and for fear of him the watchers did quake, and became as dead men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_5" data-id="MT28_5">And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye; for I know that ye seek Jesus, who hath been crucified.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_6" data-id="MT28_6">He is not here; for he is risen, even as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_7" data-id="MT28_7">And go quickly, and tell his disciples, He is risen from the dead; and lo, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_8" data-id="MT28_8">And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_9" data-id="MT28_9">And behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and took hold of his feet, and worshipped him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_10" data-id="MT28_10">Then saith Jesus unto them, Fear not: go tell my brethren that they depart into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_11" data-id="MT28_11">Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city, and told unto the chief priests all the things that were come to pass. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_12" data-id="MT28_12">And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave much money unto the soldiers,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_13" data-id="MT28_13">saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_14" data-id="MT28_14">And if this come to the governorâ€™s ears, we will persuade him, and rid you of care.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_15" data-id="MT28_15">So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying was spread abroad among the Jews, <span class="add">and continueth</span> until this day. </span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT28_16" data-id="MT28_16">But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</span>
