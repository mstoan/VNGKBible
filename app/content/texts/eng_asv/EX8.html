<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX8_4" data-id="EX8_4">and the frogs shall come up both upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX8_5" data-id="EX8_5">And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.</span>
