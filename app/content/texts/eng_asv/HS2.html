<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS2_1" data-id="HS2_1">Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS2_2" data-id="HS2_2">Contend with your mother, contend; for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband; and let her put away her whoredoms from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts; </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS2_3" data-id="HS2_3">lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS2_4" data-id="HS2_4">Yea, upon her children will I have no mercy; for they are children of whoredom;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS2_5" data-id="HS2_5">for their mother hath played the harlot; she that conceived them hath done shamefully; for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS2_6" data-id="HS2_6">Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and I will build a wall against her, that she shall not find her paths. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS2_7" data-id="HS2_7">And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS2_8" data-id="HS2_8">For she did not know that I gave her the grain, and the new wine, and the oil, and multiplied unto her silver and gold, which they used for Baal. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS2_9" data-id="HS2_9">Therefore will I take back my grain in the time thereof, and my new wine in the season thereof, and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS2_10" data-id="HS2_10">And now will I uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS2_11" data-id="HS2_11">I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS2_12" data-id="HS2_12">And I will lay waste her vines and her fig-trees, whereof she hath said, These are my hire that my lovers have given me; and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS2_13" data-id="HS2_13">And I will visit upon her the days of the Baalim, unto which she burned incense, when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS2_14" data-id="HS2_14">Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS2_15" data-id="HS2_15">And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she shall make answer there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS2_16" data-id="HS2_16">And it shall be at that day, saith Jehovah, that thou shalt call me Ishi, and shalt call me no more Baali.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS2_17" data-id="HS2_17">For I will take away the names of the Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be mentioned by their name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS2_18" data-id="HS2_18">And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the heavens, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, and will make them to lie down safely. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS2_19" data-id="HS2_19">And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in justice, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS2_20" data-id="HS2_20">I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness; and thou shalt know Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS2_21" data-id="HS2_21">And it shall come to pass in that day, I will answer, saith Jehovah, I will answer the heavens, and they shall answer the earth; </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS2_22" data-id="HS2_22">and the earth shall answer the grain, and the new wine, and the oil; and they shall answer Jezreel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS2_23" data-id="HS2_23">And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them that were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, <span class="add">Thou art</span> my God. </span>
