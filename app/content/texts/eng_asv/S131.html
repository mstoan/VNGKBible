</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S131_2" data-id="S131_2">And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.

<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S131_3" data-id="S131_3">And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S131_4" data-id="S131_4">Then said Saul to his armorbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armorbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell
 upon it. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S131_5" data-id="S131_5">And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S131_6" data-id="S131_6">So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armorbearer, and all his men, that same day together.</span>

 in them. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S131_8" data-id="S131_8">And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S131_10" data-id="S131_10">And they put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S131_11" data-id="S131_11">And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done to Saul,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v S131_12" data-id="S131_12">all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan; and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S131_13" data-id="S131_13">And they took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk-tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days. </span>
