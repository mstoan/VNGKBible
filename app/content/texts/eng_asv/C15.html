<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_1" data-id="C15_1">It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles, that one <span class="add">of you </span> hath his fatherâ€™s wife. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_2" data-id="C15_2">And ye are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_3" data-id="C15_3">For I verily, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already as though I were present judged him that hath so wrought this thing, </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_4" data-id="C15_4">in the name of our Lord Jesus, ye being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_5" data-id="C15_5">to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_6" data-id="C15_6">Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_7" data-id="C15_7">Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are unleavened. For our passover also hath been sacrificed, <span class="add">even</span> Christ: </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_8" data-id="C15_8">wherefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_9" data-id="C15_9">I wrote unto you in my epistle to have no company with fornicators;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_10" data-id="C15_10">not at all <span class="add">meaning</span> with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world: </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_11" data-id="C15_11">but as it is, I wrote unto you not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one no, not to eat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_12" data-id="C15_12">For what have I to do with judging them that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_13" data-id="C15_13">But them that are without God judgeth. Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.</span>
