<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_1" data-id="RM12_1">I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, <span class="add">which is</span> your spiritual service. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_2" data-id="RM12_2">And be not fashioned according to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_3" data-id="RM12_3">For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but so to think as to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to each man a measure of faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_4" data-id="RM12_4">For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members have not the same office:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_5" data-id="RM12_5">so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_6" data-id="RM12_6">And having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, whether prophecy, <span class="add">let us prophesy</span> according to the proportion of our faith;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_7" data-id="RM12_7">or ministry, <span class="add">let us give ourselves</span> to our ministry; or he that teacheth, to his teaching;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_8" data-id="RM12_8">or he that exhorteth, to his exhorting: he that giveth, <span class="add">let him do it</span> with liberality; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_9" data-id="RM12_9">Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_10" data-id="RM12_10">In love of the brethren be tenderly affectioned one to another; in honor preferring one another;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_11" data-id="RM12_11">in diligence not slothful; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_12" data-id="RM12_12">rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing stedfastly in prayer;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_13" data-id="RM12_13">communicating to the necessities of the saints; given to hospitality.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_14" data-id="RM12_14">Bless them that persecute you; bless, and curse not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_15" data-id="RM12_15">Rejoice with them that rejoice; weep with them that weep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_16" data-id="RM12_16">Be of the same mind one toward another. Set not your mind on high things, but condescend to things that are lowly. Be not wise in your own conceits. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_17" data-id="RM12_17">Render to no man evil for evil. Take thought for things honorable in the sight of all men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_18" data-id="RM12_18">If it be possible, as much as in you lieth, be at peace with all men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_19" data-id="RM12_19">Avenge not yourselves, beloved, but give place unto the wrath <span class="add">of God</span>: for it is written, Vengeance belongeth unto me; I will recompense, saith the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_20" data-id="RM12_20">But if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him to drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM12_21" data-id="RM12_21">Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</span>
