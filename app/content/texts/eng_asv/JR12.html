<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR12_1" data-id="JR12_1">Righteous art thou, O Jehovah, when I contend with thee; yet would I reason the cause with thee: wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they at ease that deal very treacherously?</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR12_2" data-id="JR12_2">Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root; they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their heart. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR12_3" data-id="JR12_3">But thou, O Jehovah, knowest me; thou seest me, and triest my heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR12_4" data-id="JR12_4">How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole country wither? for the wickedness of them that dwell therein, the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our latter end.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR12_5" data-id="JR12_5">If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and though in a land of peace thou art secure, yet how wilt thou do in the pride of the Jordan?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR12_6" data-id="JR12_6">For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; even they have cried aloud after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR12_7" data-id="JR12_7">I have forsaken my house, I have cast off my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR12_8" data-id="JR12_8">My heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest: she hath uttered her voice against me; therefore I have hated her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR12_9" data-id="JR12_9">Is my heritage unto me as a speckled bird of prey? are the birds of prey against her round about? go ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, bring them to devour. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR12_10" data-id="JR12_10">Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR12_11" data-id="JR12_11">They have made it a desolation; it mourneth unto me, being desolate; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR12_12" data-id="JR12_12">Destroyers are come upon all the bare heights in the wilderness; for the sword of Jehovah devoureth from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh hath peace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR12_13" data-id="JR12_13">They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns; they have put themselves to pain, and profit nothing: and ye shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce anger of Jehovah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR12_14" data-id="JR12_14">Thus saith Jehovah against all mine evil neighbors, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit: behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR12_15" data-id="JR12_15">And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them; and I will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR12_16" data-id="JR12_16">And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, As Jehovah liveth; even as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built up in the midst of my people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR12_17" data-id="JR12_17">But if they will not hear, then will I pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it, saith Jehovah.</span>
