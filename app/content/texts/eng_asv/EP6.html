<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_1" data-id="EP6_1">Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_2" data-id="EP6_2">Honor thy father and mother (which is the first commandment with promise),</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_3" data-id="EP6_3">that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_4" data-id="EP6_4">And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but nurture them in the chastening and admonition of the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_5" data-id="EP6_5">Servants, be obedient unto them that according to the flesh are your masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_6" data-id="EP6_6">not in the way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_7" data-id="EP6_7">with good will doing service, as unto the Lord, and not unto men:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_8" data-id="EP6_8">knowing that whatsoever good thing each one doeth, the same shall he receive again from the Lord, whether <span class="add">he be</span> bond or free. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_9" data-id="EP6_9">And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, and forbear threatening: knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with him. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_10" data-id="EP6_10">Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might.</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_12" data-id="EP6_12">For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual <span class="add">hosts</span> of wickedness in the heavenly
 <span class="add">places</span>. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_13" data-id="EP6_13">Wherefore take up the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand.

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_17" data-id="EP6_17">And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP6_18" data-id="EP6_18">with all prayer and supplication praying at all seasons in the Spirit, and watching thereunto in all perseverance and supplication for all the saints,
