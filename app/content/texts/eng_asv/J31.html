<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_1" data-id="J31_1">The elder unto Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_2" data-id="J31_2">Beloved, I pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_3" data-id="J31_3">For I rejoiced greatly, when brethren came and bare witness unto thy truth, even as thou walkest in truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_4" data-id="J31_4">Greater joy have I none than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_5" data-id="J31_5">Beloved, thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever thou doest toward them that are brethren and strangers withal;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_6" data-id="J31_6">who bare witness to thy love before the church: whom thou wilt do well to set forward on their journey worthily of God:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_7" data-id="J31_7">because that for the sake of the Name they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_8" data-id="J31_8">We therefore ought to welcome such, that we may be fellow-workers for the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_9" data-id="J31_9">I wrote somewhat unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_10" data-id="J31_10">Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he doeth, prating against us with wicked words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and them that would he forbiddeth and casteth <span class="add">them</span> out of the church. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_11" data-id="J31_11">Beloved, imitate not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: he that doeth evil hath not seen God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_12" data-id="J31_12">Demetrius hath the witness of all <span class="add">men</span>, and of the truth itself: yea, we also bear witness; and thou knowest that our witness is true. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_13" data-id="J31_13">I had many things to write unto thee, but I am unwilling to write <span class="add">them</span> to thee with ink and pen: </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v J31_14" data-id="J31_14">but I hope shortly to see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace <span class="add">be</span> unto thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name. </span>
