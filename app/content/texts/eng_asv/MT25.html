<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_1" data-id="MT25_1">Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_2" data-id="MT25_2">And five of them were foolish, and five were wise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_3" data-id="MT25_3">For the foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_4" data-id="MT25_4">but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_5" data-id="MT25_5">Now while the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_6" data-id="MT25_6">But at midnight there is a cry, Behold, the bridegroom! Come ye forth to meet him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_7" data-id="MT25_7">Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_8" data-id="MT25_8">And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_9" data-id="MT25_9">But the wise answered, saying, Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you: go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_10" data-id="MT25_10">And while they went away to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast: and the door was shut. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_11" data-id="MT25_11">Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_12" data-id="MT25_12">But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_13" data-id="MT25_13">Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_14" data-id="MT25_14">For <span class="add">it is</span> as <span class="add">when</span> a man, going into another country, called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_15" data-id="MT25_15">And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his several ability; and he went on his journey. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_16" data-id="MT25_16">Straightway he that received the five talents went and traded with them, and made other five talents.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_17" data-id="MT25_17">In like manner he also that <span class="add">received</span> the two gained other two.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_18" data-id="MT25_18">But he that received the one went away and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_19" data-id="MT25_19">Now after a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and maketh a reckoning with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_20" data-id="MT25_20">And he that received the five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: lo, I have gained other five talents. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_21" data-id="MT25_21">His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_22" data-id="MT25_22">And he also that <span class="add">received</span> the two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: lo, I have gained other two talents. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_23" data-id="MT25_23">His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_24" data-id="MT25_24">And he also that had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou didst not sow, and gathering where thou didst not scatter; </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_25" data-id="MT25_25">and I was afraid, and went away and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, thou hast thine own.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_26" data-id="MT25_26">But his lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I did not scatter; </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_27" data-id="MT25_27">thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back mine own with interest. </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_28" data-id="MT25_28">Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him that hath the ten talents.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_29" data-id="MT25_29">For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away. </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_30" data-id="MT25_30">And cast ye out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</span>

<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_31" data-id="MT25_31">But when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory: </span>

<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT25_41" data-id="MT25_41">Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels: </span>
