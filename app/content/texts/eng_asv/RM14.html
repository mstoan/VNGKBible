<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_1" data-id="RM14_1">But him that is weak in faith receive ye, <span class="add">yet</span> not for decision of scruples.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_2" data-id="RM14_2">One man hath faith to eat all things: but he that is weak eateth herbs.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_3" data-id="RM14_3">Let not him that eateth set at nought him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_4" data-id="RM14_4">Who art thou that judgest the servant of another? to his own lord he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be made to stand; for the Lord hath power to make him stand. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_5" data-id="RM14_5">One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day <span class="add">alike</span>. Let each man be fully assured in his own mind. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_6" data-id="RM14_6">He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord: and he that eateth, eateth unto the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, unto the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_7" data-id="RM14_7">For none of us liveth to himself, and none dieth to himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_8" data-id="RM14_8">For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_9" data-id="RM14_9">For to this end Christ died and lived <span class="add">again</span>, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_10" data-id="RM14_10">But thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? or thou again, why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_11" data-id="RM14_11">For it is written,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM14_11" data-id="RM14_11">As I live, saith the Lord, to me every knee shall bow,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM14_11" data-id="RM14_11">And every tongue shall confess to God.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_12" data-id="RM14_12">So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_13" data-id="RM14_13">Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge ye this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock in his brother’s way, or an occasion of falling. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_14" data-id="RM14_14">I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: save that to him who accounteth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_15" data-id="RM14_15">For if because of meat thy brother is grieved, thou walkest no longer in love. Destroy not with thy meat him for whom Christ died. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_16" data-id="RM14_16">Let not then your good be evil spoken of:</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_17" data-id="RM14_17">for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_18" data-id="RM14_18">For he that herein serveth Christ is well-pleasing to God, and approved of men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_19" data-id="RM14_19">So then let us follow after things which make for peace, and things whereby we may edify one another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_20" data-id="RM14_20">Overthrow not for meat’s sake the work of God. All things indeed are clean; howbeit it is evil for that man who eateth with offence. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_21" data-id="RM14_21">It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor <span class="add">to do anything </span> whereby thy brother stumbleth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_22" data-id="RM14_22">The faith which thou hast, have thou to thyself before God. Happy is he that judgeth not himself in that which he approveth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM14_23" data-id="RM14_23">But he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because <span class="add">he eateth </span> not of faith; and whatsoever is not of faith is sin. </span>
