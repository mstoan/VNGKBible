<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_1" data-id="C18_1">Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_2" data-id="C18_2">If any man thinketh that he knoweth anything, he knoweth not yet as he ought to know;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_3" data-id="C18_3">but if any man loveth God, the same is known by him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_4" data-id="C18_4">Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is <span class="add">anything</span> in the world, and that there is no God but one.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_5" data-id="C18_5">For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth; as there are gods many, and lords many;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_6" data-id="C18_6">yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_7" data-id="C18_7">Howbeit there is not in all men that knowledge: but some, being used until now to the idol, eat as <span class="add">of</span> a thing sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_8" data-id="C18_8">But food will not commend us to God: neither, if we eat not, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_9" data-id="C18_9">But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to the weak.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_10" data-id="C18_10">For if a man see thee who hast knowledge sitting at meat in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols? </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_11" data-id="C18_11">For through thy knowledge he that is weak perisheth, the brother for whose sake Christ died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_12" data-id="C18_12">And thus, sinning against the brethren, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, ye sin against Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_13" data-id="C18_13">Wherefore, if meat causeth my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh for evermore, that I cause not my brother to stumble. </span>
