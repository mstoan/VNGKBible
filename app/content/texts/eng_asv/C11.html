<div class="c">1</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_1" data-id="C11_1">Paul, called <span class="add">to be</span> an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_2" data-id="C11_2">unto the church of God which is at Corinth, <span class="add">even</span> them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called <span class="add">to be</span> saints, with all that call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, their <span class="add">Lord </span> and ours: </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_3" data-id="C11_3">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_4" data-id="C11_4">I thank my God always concerning you, for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_5" data-id="C11_5">that in everything ye were enriched in him, in all utterance and all knowledge;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_6" data-id="C11_6">even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_7" data-id="C11_7">so that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_8" data-id="C11_8">who shall also confirm you unto the end, <span class="add">that ye be</span> unreproveable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_9" data-id="C11_9">God is faithful, through whom ye were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_10" data-id="C11_10">Now I beseech you, brethren, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and <span class="add">that</span> there be no divisions among you; but <span class="add">that</span> ye be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_11" data-id="C11_11">For it hath been signified unto me concerning you, my brethren, by them <span class="add">that are of the household</span> of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_12" data-id="C11_12">Now this I mean, that each one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_13" data-id="C11_13">Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized into the name of Paul?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_14" data-id="C11_14">I thank God that I baptized none of you, save Crispus and Gaius;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_15" data-id="C11_15">lest any man should say that ye were baptized into my name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_16" data-id="C11_16">And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_17" data-id="C11_17">For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made void. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_18" data-id="C11_18">For the word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us who are saved it is the power of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_19" data-id="C11_19">For it is written,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v C11_19" data-id="C11_19">I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v C11_19" data-id="C11_19">And the discernment of the discerning will I bring to nought.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_20" data-id="C11_20">Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_21" data-id="C11_21">For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom knew not God, it was Godâ€™s good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save them that believe. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_22" data-id="C11_22">Seeing that Jews ask for signs, and Greeks seek after wisdom:</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_23" data-id="C11_23">but we preach Christ crucified, unto Jews a stumblingblock, and unto Gentiles foolishness;</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_24" data-id="C11_24">but unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_25" data-id="C11_25">Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_26" data-id="C11_26">For behold your calling, brethren, that not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, <span class="add">are called</span>: </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_27" data-id="C11_27">but God chose the foolish things of the world, that he might put to shame them that are wise; and God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_28" data-id="C11_28">and the base things of the world, and the things that are despised, did God choose, <span class="add">yea</span> and the things that are not, that he might bring to nought the things that are:</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_29" data-id="C11_29">that no flesh should glory before God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_30" data-id="C11_30">But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who was made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption: </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_31" data-id="C11_31">that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</span>
