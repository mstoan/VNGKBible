<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_1" data-id="HS10_1">Israel is a luxuriant vine, that putteth forth his fruit: according to the abundance of his fruit he hath multiplied his altars; according to the goodness of their land they have made goodly pillars.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_2" data-id="HS10_2">Their heart is divided; now shall they be found guilty: he will smite their altars, he will destroy their pillars.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_3" data-id="HS10_3">Surely now shall they say, We have no king; for we fear not Jehovah; and the king, what can he do for us?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_4" data-id="HS10_4">They speak <span class="add">vain</span> words, swearing falsely in making covenants: therefore judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_5" data-id="HS10_5">The inhabitants of Samaria shall be in terror for the calves of Beth-aven; for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced over it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_6" data-id="HS10_6">It also shall be carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_7" data-id="HS10_7"> <span class="add">As for</span> Samaria, her king is cut off, as foam upon the water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_8" data-id="HS10_8">The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_9" data-id="HS10_9">O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood; the battle against the children of iniquity doth not overtake them in Gibeah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_10" data-id="HS10_10">When it is my desire, I will chastise them; and the peoples shall be gathered against them, when they are bound to their two transgressions. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_11" data-id="HS10_11">And Ephraim is a heifer that is taught, that loveth to tread out <span class="add">the grain</span>; but I have passed over upon her fair neck: I will set a rider on Ephraim; Judah shall plow, Jacob shall break his clods. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_12" data-id="HS10_12">Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap according to kindness; break up your fallow ground; for it is time to seek Jehovah, till he come and rain righteousness upon you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_13" data-id="HS10_13">Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies; for thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_14" data-id="HS10_14">Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces with her children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS10_15" data-id="HS10_15">So shall Beth-el do unto you because of your great wickedness: at daybreak shall the king of Israel be utterly cut off.</span>
