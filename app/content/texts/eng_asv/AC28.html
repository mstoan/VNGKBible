<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_1" data-id="AC28_1">And when we were escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_2" data-id="AC28_2">And the barbarians showed us no common kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_3" data-id="AC28_3">But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out by reason of the heat, and fastened on his hand. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_4" data-id="AC28_4">And when the barbarians saw the <span class="add">venomous</span> creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped from the sea, yet Justice hath not suffered to live.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_5" data-id="AC28_5">Howbeit he shook off the creature into the fire, and took no harm.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_6" data-id="AC28_6">But they expected that he would have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but when they were long in expectation and beheld nothing amiss came to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_7" data-id="AC28_7">Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius; who received us, and entertained us three days courteously. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_8" data-id="AC28_8">And it was so, that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery: unto whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laying his hands on him healed him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_9" data-id="AC28_9">And when this was done, the rest also that had diseases in the island came, and were cured:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_10" data-id="AC28_10">who also honored us with many honors; and when we sailed, they put on board such things as we needed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_11" data-id="AC28_11">And after three months we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The Twin Brothers. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_12" data-id="AC28_12">And touching at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_13" data-id="AC28_13">And from thence we made a circuit, and arrived at Rhegium: and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli; </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_14" data-id="AC28_14">where we found brethren, and were entreated to tarry with them seven days: and so we came to Rome.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_15" data-id="AC28_15">And from thence the brethren, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_16" data-id="AC28_16">And when we entered into Rome, Paul was suffered to abide by himself with the soldier that guarded him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_17" data-id="AC28_17">And it came to pass, that after three days he called together those that were the chief of the Jews: and when they were come together, he said unto them, I, brethren, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans:</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_18" data-id="AC28_18">who, when they had examined me, desired to set me at liberty, because there was no cause of death in me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_19" data-id="AC28_19">But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Cæsar; not that I had aught whereof to accuse my nation. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_20" data-id="AC28_20">For this cause therefore did I entreat you to see and to speak with <span class="add">me</span>: for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_21" data-id="AC28_21">And they said unto him, We neither received letters from Judæa concerning thee, nor did any of the brethren come hither and report or speak any harm of thee. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_22" data-id="AC28_22">But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_23" data-id="AC28_23">And when they had appointed him a day, they came to him into his lodging in great number; to whom he expounded <span class="add">the matter,</span> testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning till evening. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_24" data-id="AC28_24">And some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_25" data-id="AC28_25">And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Spirit through Isaiah the prophet unto your fathers, </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC28_26" data-id="AC28_26">saying,</span>
