<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_2" data-id="RM13_2">Therefore he that resisteth the power, withstandeth the ordinance of God: and they that withstand shall receive to themselves judgment. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_3" data-id="RM13_3">For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. And wouldest thou have no fear of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise from the same: </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_4" data-id="RM13_4">for he is a minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is a minister of God, an avenger for wrath to him that doeth evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM13_5" data-id="RM13_5">Wherefore <span class="add">ye</span> must needs be in subjection, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience’ sake.</span>
