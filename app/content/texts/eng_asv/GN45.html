<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_2" data-id="GN45_2">And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_3" data-id="GN45_3">And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_4" data-id="GN45_4">And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_5" data-id="GN45_5">And now be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_6" data-id="GN45_6">For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and there are yet five years, in which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_7" data-id="GN45_7">And God sent me before you to preserve you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_8" data-id="GN45_8">So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_9" data-id="GN45_9">Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not; </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_10" data-id="GN45_10">and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children’s children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_11" data-id="GN45_11">and there will I nourish thee; for there are yet five years of famine; lest thou come to poverty, thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_12" data-id="GN45_12">And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_16" data-id="GN45_16">And the report thereof was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, Joseph’s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_17" data-id="GN45_17">And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye: lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_18" data-id="GN45_18">and take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_19" data-id="GN45_19">Now thou art commanded, this do ye: take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_20" data-id="GN45_20">Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.</span>

<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_21" data-id="GN45_21">And the sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_22" data-id="GN45_22">To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_23" data-id="GN45_23">And to his father he sent after this manner: ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_24" data-id="GN45_24">So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_25" data-id="GN45_25">And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_26" data-id="GN45_26">And they told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for he believed them not. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_27" data-id="GN45_27">And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived: </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN45_28" data-id="GN45_28">and Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.</span>
