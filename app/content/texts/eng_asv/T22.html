<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_2" data-id="T22_2">And the things which thou hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_3" data-id="T22_3">Suffer hardship with <span class="add">me</span>, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_4" data-id="T22_4">No soldier on service entangleth himself in the affairs of <span class="add">this </span> life; that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_5" data-id="T22_5">And if also a man contend in the games, he is not crowned, except he have contended lawfully.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_6" data-id="T22_6">The husbandman that laboreth must be the first to partake of the fruits.</span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_8" data-id="T22_8">Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_9" data-id="T22_9">wherein I suffer hardship unto bonds, as a malefactor; but the word of God is not bound.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_10" data-id="T22_10">Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_11" data-id="T22_11">Faithful is the saying: For if we died with him, we shall also live with him:</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_12" data-id="T22_12">if we endure, we shall also reign with him: if we shall deny him, he also will deny us:</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_13" data-id="T22_13">if we are faithless, he abideth faithful; for he cannot deny himself.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_15" data-id="T22_15">Give diligence to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, handling aright the word of truth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_16" data-id="T22_16">But shun profane babblings: for they will proceed further in ungodliness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_17" data-id="T22_17">and their word will eat as doth a gangrene: of whom is Hymenæus and Philetus;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_18" data-id="T22_18">men who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some.</span>

<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_21" data-id="T22_21">If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, meet for the master’s use, prepared unto every good work. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_22" data-id="T22_22">But flee youthful lusts, and follow after righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_23" data-id="T22_23">But foolish and ignorant questionings refuse, knowing that they gender strifes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_24" data-id="T22_24">And the Lord’s servant must not strive, but be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_25" data-id="T22_25">in meekness correcting them that oppose themselves; if peradventure God may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth, </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v T22_26" data-id="T22_26">and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him unto his will.</span>
