<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_1" data-id="R121_1">And Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_2" data-id="R121_2">And David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know the sum of them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_3" data-id="R121_3">And Joab said, Jehovah make his people a hundred times as many as they are: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord’s servants? why doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of guilt unto Israel?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_4" data-id="R121_4">Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_5" data-id="R121_5">And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_6" data-id="R121_6">But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them; for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_7" data-id="R121_7">And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_8" data-id="R121_8">And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing: but now put away, I beseech thee, the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_9" data-id="R121_9">And Jehovah spake unto Gad, David’s seer, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_10" data-id="R121_10">Go and speak unto David, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_11" data-id="R121_11">So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Take which thou wilt:</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_12" data-id="R121_12">either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before thy foes, while the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of Jehovah, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Jehovah destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him that sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_13" data-id="R121_13">And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Jehovah; for very great are his mercies: and let me not fall into the hand of man. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_14" data-id="R121_14">So Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_15" data-id="R121_15">And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was about to destroy, Jehovah beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the destroying angel, It is enough; now stay thy hand. And the angel of Jehovah was standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_16" data-id="R121_16">And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Jehovah standing between earth and heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_17" data-id="R121_17">And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, O Jehovah my God, be against me, and against my father’s house; but not against thy people, that they should be plagued.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_18" data-id="R121_18">Then the angel of Jehovah commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and rear an altar unto Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_19" data-id="R121_19">And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_20" data-id="R121_20">And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons that were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_21" data-id="R121_21">And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_22" data-id="R121_22">Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing-floor, that I may build thereon an altar unto Jehovah: for the full price shalt thou give it me, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_23" data-id="R121_23">And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give <span class="add">thee</span> the oxen for burnt-offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal-offering; I give it all. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_24" data-id="R121_24">And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for Jehovah, nor offer a burnt-offering without cost. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_25" data-id="R121_25">So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_26" data-id="R121_26">And David built there an altar unto Jehovah, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon Jehovah; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_27" data-id="R121_27">And Jehovah commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_28" data-id="R121_28">At that time, when David saw that Jehovah had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there. </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_29" data-id="R121_29">For the tabernacle of Jehovah, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt-offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon. </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v R121_30" data-id="R121_30">But David could not go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Jehovah.</span>
