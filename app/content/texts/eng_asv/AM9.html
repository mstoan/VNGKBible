<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_1" data-id="AM9_1">I saw the Lord standing beside the altar: and he said, Smite the capitals, that the thresholds may shake; and break them in pieces on the head of all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: there shall not one of them flee away, and there shall not one of them escape. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_2" data-id="AM9_2">Though they dig into Sheol, thence shall my hand take them; and though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_3" data-id="AM9_3">And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and it shall bite them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_4" data-id="AM9_4">And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_5" data-id="AM9_5">For the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, <span class="add">is</span> he that toucheth the land and it melteth, and all that dwell therein shall mourn; and it shall rise up wholly like the River, and shall sink again, like the River of Egypt;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_6" data-id="AM9_6"> <span class="add">it is</span> he that buildeth his chambers in the heavens, and hath founded his vault upon the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth; Jehovah is his name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_7" data-id="AM9_7">Are ye not as the children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith Jehovah. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_8" data-id="AM9_8">Behold, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; save that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_9" data-id="AM9_9">For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations, like as <span class="add">grain</span> is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least kernel fall upon the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_10" data-id="AM9_10">All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, who say, The evil shall not overtake nor meet us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_11" data-id="AM9_11">In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old; </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_12" data-id="AM9_12">that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations that are called by my name, saith Jehovah that doeth this.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_13" data-id="AM9_13">Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_14" data-id="AM9_14">And I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM9_15" data-id="AM9_15">And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be plucked up out of their land which I have given them, saith Jehovah thy God. </span>
