<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_3" data-id="ZP2_3">Seek ye Jehovah, all ye meek of the earth, that have kept his ordinances; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye will be hid in the day of Jehovah’s anger. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_4" data-id="ZP2_4">For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation; they shall drive out Ashdod at noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted up. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_5" data-id="ZP2_5">Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea-coast, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of Jehovah is against you, O Canaan, the land of the Philistines; I will destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_6" data-id="ZP2_6">And the sea-coast shall be pastures, with cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_7" data-id="ZP2_7">And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed <span class="add">their flocks</span> thereupon; in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening; for Jehovah their God will visit them, and bring back their captivity. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_8" data-id="ZP2_8">I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, wherewith they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_9" data-id="ZP2_9">Therefore as I live, saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall make a prey of them, and the remnant of my nation shall inherit them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_10" data-id="ZP2_10">This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Jehovah of hosts. </span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_14" data-id="ZP2_14">And herds shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the pelican and the porcupine shall lodge in the capitals thereof; <span class="add">their</span> voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds: for he hath laid bare the cedar-work. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZP2_15" data-id="ZP2_15">This is the joyous city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none besides me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.</span>
