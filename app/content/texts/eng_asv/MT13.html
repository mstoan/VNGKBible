<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_1" data-id="MT13_1">On that day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_2" data-id="MT13_2">And there were gathered unto him great multitudes, so that he entered into a boat, and sat; and all the multitude stood on the beach. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_3" data-id="MT13_3">And he spake to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went forth to sow;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_4" data-id="MT13_4">and as he sowed, some <span class="add">seeds</span> fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured them:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_5" data-id="MT13_5">and others fell upon the rocky places, where they had not much earth: and straightway they sprang up, because they had no deepness of earth: </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_6" data-id="MT13_6">and when the sun was risen, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_7" data-id="MT13_7">And others fell upon the thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked them:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_8" data-id="MT13_8">and others fell upon the good ground, and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_9" data-id="MT13_9">He that hath ears, let him hear.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_10" data-id="MT13_10">And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_11" data-id="MT13_11">And he answered and said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_12" data-id="MT13_12">For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_13" data-id="MT13_13">Therefore speak I to them in parables; because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_14" data-id="MT13_14">And unto them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith,</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_16" data-id="MT13_16">But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_17" data-id="MT13_17">For verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_18" data-id="MT13_18">Hear then ye the parable of the sower.</span>

This is he that was sown by the way side. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_20" data-id="MT13_20">And he that was sown upon the rocky places, this is he that heareth the word, and straightway with joy receiveth it;</span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_22" data-id="MT13_22">And he that was sown among the thorns, this is he that heareth the word; and the care of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_23" data-id="MT13_23">And he that was sown upon the good ground, this is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; who verily beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_24" data-id="MT13_24">Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his field: </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_25" data-id="MT13_25">but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat, and went away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_26" data-id="MT13_26">But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_27" data-id="MT13_27">And the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares? </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_28" data-id="MT13_28">And he said unto them, An enemy hath done this. And the servants say unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_29" data-id="MT13_29">But he saith, Nay; lest haply while ye gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_30" data-id="MT13_30">Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_31" data-id="MT13_31">Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field: </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_32" data-id="MT13_32">which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_33" data-id="MT13_33">Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_34" data-id="MT13_34">All these things spake Jesus in parables unto the multitudes; and without a parable spake he nothing unto them:</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_35" data-id="MT13_35">that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v MT13_35" data-id="MT13_35">I will open my mouth in parables;</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v MT13_35" data-id="MT13_35">I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_36" data-id="MT13_36">Then he left the multitudes, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Explain unto us the parable of the tares of the field. </span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_37" data-id="MT13_37">And he answered and said, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_38" data-id="MT13_38">and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil <span class="add">one</span>; </span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_39" data-id="MT13_39">and the enemy that sowed them is the devil: and the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are angels.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_40" data-id="MT13_40">As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire; so shall it be in the end of the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_41" data-id="MT13_41">The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and them that do iniquity, </span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_42" data-id="MT13_42">and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_43" data-id="MT13_43">Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears, let him hear.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_44" data-id="MT13_44">The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in the field; which a man found, and hid; and in his joy he goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_45" data-id="MT13_45">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls:</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_46" data-id="MT13_46">and having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_47" data-id="MT13_47">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_48" data-id="MT13_48">which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach; and they sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but the bad they cast away. </span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_49" data-id="MT13_49">So shall it be in the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the righteous,</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_50" data-id="MT13_50">and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</span>

<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_51" data-id="MT13_51">Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_52" data-id="MT13_52">And he said unto them, Therefore every scribe who hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_53" data-id="MT13_53">And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_54" data-id="MT13_54">And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works? </span>
<span class="v-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v MT13_55" data-id="MT13_55">Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas? </span>
