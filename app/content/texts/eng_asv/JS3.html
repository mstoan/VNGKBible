<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS3_4" data-id="JS3_4">Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go; for ye have not passed this way heretofore.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS3_5" data-id="JS3_5">And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow Jehovah will do wonders among you.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS3_15" data-id="JS3_15">and when they that bare the ark were come unto the Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brink of the water (for the Jordan overfloweth all its banks all the time of harvest),</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS3_16" data-id="JS3_16">that the waters which came down from above stood, and rose up in one heap, a great way off, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan; and those that went down toward the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho. </span>
