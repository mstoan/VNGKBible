<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_1" data-id="RV5_1">And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back, close sealed with seven seals. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_2" data-id="RV5_2">And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_3" data-id="RV5_3">And no one in the heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look thereon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_4" data-id="RV5_4">And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look thereon:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_5" data-id="RV5_5">and one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not; behold, the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath overcome to open the book and the seven seals thereof. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_6" data-id="RV5_6">And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_7" data-id="RV5_7">And he came, and he taketh <span class="add">it</span> out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_8" data-id="RV5_8">And when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having each one a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.</span>

<span class="v RV5_9" data-id="RV5_9">Worthy art thou to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and didst purchase unto God with thy blood <span class="add">men</span> of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_10" data-id="RV5_10">and madest them <span class="add">to be</span> unto our God a kingdom and priests; and they reign upon the earth.</span>
