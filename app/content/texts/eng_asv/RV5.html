<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_4" data-id="RV5_4">And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look thereon:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_5" data-id="RV5_5">and one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not; behold, the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath overcome to open the book and the seven seals thereof. </span>
