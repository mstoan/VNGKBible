<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_1" data-id="EC2_1">I said in my heart, Come now, I will prove thee with mirth; therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also was vanity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_2" data-id="EC2_2">I said of laughter, It is mad; and of mirth, What doeth it?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_3" data-id="EC2_3">I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my heart yet guiding <span class="add">me</span> with wisdom, and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do under heaven all the days of their life. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_4" data-id="EC2_4">I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_5" data-id="EC2_5">I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_6" data-id="EC2_6">I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_7" data-id="EC2_7">I bought men-servants and maid-servants, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all that were before me in Jerusalem; </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_8" data-id="EC2_8">I gathered me also silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces; I gat me men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the sons of men, musical instruments, and that of all sorts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_9" data-id="EC2_9">So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_10" data-id="EC2_10">And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced because of all my labor; and this was my portion from all my labor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_11" data-id="EC2_11">Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_12" data-id="EC2_12">And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what <span class="add">can</span> the man <span class="add">do</span> that cometh after the king? <span class="add">even </span> that which hath been done long ago. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_13" data-id="EC2_13">Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_14" data-id="EC2_14">The wise man’s eyes are in his head, and the fool walketh in darkness: and yet I perceived that one event happeneth to them all. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_15" data-id="EC2_15">Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then said I in my heart, that this also is vanity. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_16" data-id="EC2_16">For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. And how doth the wise man die even as the fool!</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_17" data-id="EC2_17">So I hated life, because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and a striving after wind. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_18" data-id="EC2_18">And I hated all my labor wherein I labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_19" data-id="EC2_19">And who knoweth whether he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_20" data-id="EC2_20">Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor wherein I had labored under the sun.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_21" data-id="EC2_21">For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skilfulness; yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_22" data-id="EC2_22">For what hath a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, wherein he laboreth under the sun?</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_23" data-id="EC2_23">For all his days are <span class="add">but</span> sorrows, and his travail is grief; yea, even in the night his heart taketh no rest. This also is vanity. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_24" data-id="EC2_24">There is nothing better for a man <span class="add">than</span> that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_25" data-id="EC2_25">For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_26" data-id="EC2_26">For to the man that pleaseth him <span class="add">God</span> giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that pleaseth God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</span>
