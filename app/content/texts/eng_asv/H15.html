<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_1" data-id="H15_1">But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that aught be written unto you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_2" data-id="H15_2">For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_3" data-id="H15_3">When they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall in no wise escape. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_4" data-id="H15_4">But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_5" data-id="H15_5">for ye are all sons of light, and sons of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_6" data-id="H15_6">so then let us not sleep, as do the rest, but let us watch and be sober.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_7" data-id="H15_7">For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that are drunken are drunken in the night.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_8" data-id="H15_8">But let us, since we are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_9" data-id="H15_9">For God appointed us not unto wrath, but unto the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_10" data-id="H15_10">who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_11" data-id="H15_11">Wherefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as also ye do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_12" data-id="H15_12">But we beseech you, brethren, to know them that labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_13" data-id="H15_13">and to esteem them exceeding highly in love for their work’s sake. Be at peace among yourselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_14" data-id="H15_14">And we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be longsuffering toward all. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_15" data-id="H15_15">See that none render unto any one evil for evil; but always follow after that which is good, one toward another, and toward all. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_16" data-id="H15_16">Rejoice always;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_17" data-id="H15_17">pray without ceasing;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_18" data-id="H15_18">in everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus to you-ward.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_19" data-id="H15_19">Quench not the Spirit;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_20" data-id="H15_20">despise not prophesyings;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_21" data-id="H15_21">prove all things; hold fast that which is good;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_22" data-id="H15_22">abstain from every form of evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_23" data-id="H15_23">And the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_24" data-id="H15_24">Faithful is he that calleth you, who will also do it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_25" data-id="H15_25">Brethren, pray for us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_26" data-id="H15_26">Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_27" data-id="H15_27">I adjure you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the brethren.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v H15_28" data-id="H15_28">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</span>
