<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_2" data-id="GN13_2">And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_3" data-id="GN13_3">And he went on his journeys from the South even to Beth-el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Ai, </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_4" data-id="GN13_4">unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_5" data-id="GN13_5">And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_6" data-id="GN13_6">And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_7" data-id="GN13_7">And there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdsmen of Lot’s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_8" data-id="GN13_8">And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen; for we are brethren. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_9" data-id="GN13_9">Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if <span class="add">thou wilt take</span> the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if <span class="add">thou take</span> the right hand, then I will go to the left. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_10" data-id="GN13_10">And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the Plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt, as thou goest unto Zoar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_11" data-id="GN13_11">So Lot chose him all the Plain of the Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN13_12" data-id="GN13_12">Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the Plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.</span>
