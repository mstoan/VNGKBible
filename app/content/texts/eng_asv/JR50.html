<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_6" data-id="JR50_6">My people have been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray; they have turned them away on the mountains; they have gone from mountain to hill; they have forgotten their resting-place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR50_7" data-id="JR50_7">All that found them have devoured them; and their adversaries said, We are not guilty, because they have sinned against Jehovah, the habitation of righteousness, even Jehovah, the hope of their fathers.</span>
