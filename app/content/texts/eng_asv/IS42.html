<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS42_14" data-id="IS42_14">I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: <span class="add">now</span> will I cry out like a travailing woman; I will gasp and pant together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS42_15" data-id="IS42_15">I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and will dry up the pools. </span>
