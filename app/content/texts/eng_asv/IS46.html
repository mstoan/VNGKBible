<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS46_1" data-id="IS46_1">Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth; their idols are upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: the things that ye carried about are made a load, a burden to the weary <span class="add">beast</span>. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS46_2" data-id="IS46_2">They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS46_3" data-id="IS46_3">Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, that have been borne <span class="add">by me</span> from their birth, that have been carried from the womb;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS46_4" data-id="IS46_4">and even to old age I am he, and even to hoar hairs will I carry <span class="add">you</span>; I have made, and I will bear; yea, I will carry, and will deliver.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS46_7" data-id="IS46_7">They bear it upon the shoulder, they carry it, and set it in its place, and it standeth, from its place shall it not remove: yea, one may cry unto it, yet can it not answer, nor save him out of his trouble.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS46_8" data-id="IS46_8">Remember this, and show yourselves men; bring it again to mind, O ye transgressors.</span>
