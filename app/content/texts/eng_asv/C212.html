<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_1" data-id="C212_1">I must needs glory, though it is not expedient; but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_2" data-id="C212_2">I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not; or whether out of the body, I know not; God knoweth), such a one caught up even to the third heaven. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_3" data-id="C212_3">And I know such a man (whether in the body, or apart from the body, I know not; God knoweth),</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_4" data-id="C212_4">how that he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_5" data-id="C212_5">On behalf of such a one will I glory: but on mine own behalf I will not glory, save in <span class="add">my</span> weaknesses. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_6" data-id="C212_6">For if I should desire to glory, I shall not be foolish; for I shall speak the truth: but I forbear, lest any man should account of me above that which he seeth me <span class="add">to be</span>, or heareth from me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_7" data-id="C212_7">And by reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, that I should not be exalted overmuch.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_8" data-id="C212_8">Concerning this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_9" data-id="C212_9">And he hath said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for <span class="add">my</span> power is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_10" data-id="C212_10">Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christâ€™s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_11" data-id="C212_11">I am become foolish: ye compelled me; for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I am nothing. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_12" data-id="C212_12">Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, by signs and wonders and mighty works.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_13" data-id="C212_13">For what is there wherein ye were made inferior to the rest of the churches, except <span class="add">it be</span> that I myself was not a burden to you? forgive me this wrong.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_14" data-id="C212_14">Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be a burden to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_15" data-id="C212_15">And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_16" data-id="C212_16">But be it so, I did not myself burden you; but, being crafty, I caught you with guile.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_17" data-id="C212_17">Did I take advantage of you by any one of them whom I have sent unto you?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_18" data-id="C212_18">I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? walked we not in the same spirit? <span class="add">walked we</span> not in the same steps? </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_19" data-id="C212_19">Ye think all this time that we are excusing ourselves unto you. In the sight of God speak we in Christ. But all things, beloved, <span class="add">are</span> for your edifying. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_20" data-id="C212_20">For I fear, lest by any means, when I come, I should find you not such as I would, and should myself be found of you such as ye would not; lest by any means <span class="add">there should be</span> strife, jealousy, wraths, factions, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults; </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C212_21" data-id="C212_21">lest again when I come my God should humble me before you, and I should mourn for many of them that have sinned heretofore, and repented not of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they committed.</span>
