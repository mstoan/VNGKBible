<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS6_1" data-id="HS6_1">Come, and let us return unto Jehovah; for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS6_2" data-id="HS6_2">After two days will he revive us: on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS6_3" data-id="HS6_3">And let us know, let us follow on to know Jehovah: his going forth is sure as the morning; and he will come unto us as the rain, as the latter rain that watereth the earth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS6_4" data-id="HS6_4">O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that goeth early away. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS6_5" data-id="HS6_5">Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are <span class="add">as</span> the light that goeth forth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS6_6" data-id="HS6_6">For I desire goodness, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS6_7" data-id="HS6_7">But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS6_8" data-id="HS6_8">Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity; it is stained with blood.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS6_9" data-id="HS6_9">And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem; yea, they have committed lewdness. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS6_10" data-id="HS6_10">In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing: there whoredom is <span class="add">found</span> in Ephraim, Israel is defiled. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS6_11" data-id="HS6_11">Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for thee, when I bring back the captivity of my people.</span>
