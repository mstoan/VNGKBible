<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_1" data-id="RM2_1">Wherefore thou art without excuse, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest dost practise the same things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_2" data-id="RM2_2">And we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against them that practise such things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_3" data-id="RM2_3">And reckonest thou this, O man, who judgest them that practise such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God? </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_4" data-id="RM2_4">Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_5" data-id="RM2_5">but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up for thyself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_6" data-id="RM2_6">who will render to every man according to his works:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_7" data-id="RM2_7">to them that by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and incorruption, eternal life:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_8" data-id="RM2_8">but unto them that are factious, and obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness, <span class="add">shall be</span> wrath and indignation, </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_9" data-id="RM2_9">tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_10" data-id="RM2_10">but glory and honor and peace to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_11" data-id="RM2_11">for there is no respect of persons with God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_12" data-id="RM2_12">For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without the law: and as many as have sinned under the law shall be judged by the law; </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_13" data-id="RM2_13">for not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_14" data-id="RM2_14">(for when Gentiles that have not the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are the law unto themselves; </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_15" data-id="RM2_15">in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness therewith, and their thoughts one with another accusing or else excusing <span class="add">them</span>);</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_16" data-id="RM2_16">in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my gospel, by Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_17" data-id="RM2_17">But if thou bearest the name of a Jew, and restest upon the law, and gloriest in God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_18" data-id="RM2_18">and knowest his will, and approvest the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_19" data-id="RM2_19">and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_20" data-id="RM2_20">a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_21" data-id="RM2_21">thou therefore that teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal? </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_22" data-id="RM2_22">thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou rob temples? </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_23" data-id="RM2_23">thou who gloriest in the law, through thy transgression of the law dishonorest thou God?</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_24" data-id="RM2_24">For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you, even as it is written.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_25" data-id="RM2_25">For circumcision indeed profiteth, if thou be a doer of the law: but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is become uncircumcision. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_26" data-id="RM2_26">If therefore the uncircumcision keep the ordinances of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision? </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_27" data-id="RM2_27">and shall not the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who with the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law? </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_28" data-id="RM2_28">For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh:</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM2_29" data-id="RM2_29">but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God. </span>
