<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_1" data-id="HB8_1">Now in the things which we are saying the chief point <span class="add">is this</span>: We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_2" data-id="HB8_2">a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_3" data-id="HB8_3">For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that this <span class="add">high priest</span> also have somewhat to offer. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_4" data-id="HB8_4">Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are those who offer the gifts according to the law;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_5" data-id="HB8_5">who serve <span class="add">that which is</span> a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses is warned <span class="add">of God</span> when he is about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern that was showed thee in the mount. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_6" data-id="HB8_6">But now hath he obtained a ministry the more excellent, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which hath been enacted upon better promises. </span>
