<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_2" data-id="ZC9_2">and Hamath, also, which bordereth thereon; Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_3" data-id="ZC9_3">And Tyre did build herself a stronghold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.</span>

<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_5" data-id="ZC9_5">Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also, and shall be sore pained; and Ekron, for her expectation shall be put to shame; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_6" data-id="ZC9_6">And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_7" data-id="ZC9_7">And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth; and he also shall be a remnant for our God; and he shall be as a chieftain in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_8" data-id="ZC9_8">And I will encamp about my house against the army, that none pass through or return; and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_9" data-id="ZC9_9">Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy king cometh unto thee; he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, even upon a colt the foal of an ass.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_10" data-id="ZC9_10">And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem; and the battle bow shall be cut off; and he shall speak peace unto the nations: and his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_11" data-id="ZC9_11">As for thee also, because of the blood of thy covenant I have set free thy prisoners from the pit wherein is no water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_12" data-id="ZC9_12">Turn you to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope: even to-day do I declare that I will render double unto thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_13" data-id="ZC9_13">For I have bent Judah for me, I have filled the bow with Ephraim; and I will stir up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and will make thee as the sword of a mighty man. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_14" data-id="ZC9_14">And Jehovah shall be seen over them; and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning; and the Lord Jehovah will blow the trumpet, and will go with whirlwinds of the south. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_15" data-id="ZC9_15">Jehovah of hosts will defend them; and they shall devour, and shall tread down the sling-stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, like the corners of the altar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_16" data-id="ZC9_16">And Jehovah their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people; for <span class="add">they shall be as</span> the stones of a crown, lifted on high over his land.</span>
