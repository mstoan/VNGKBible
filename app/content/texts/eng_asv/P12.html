<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_2" data-id="P12_2">as newborn babes, long for the spiritual milk which is without guile, that ye may grow thereby unto salvation;</span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_10" data-id="P12_10">who in time past were no people, but now are the people of God: who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_11" data-id="P12_11">Beloved, I beseech you as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_12" data-id="P12_12">having your behavior seemly among the Gentiles; that, wherein they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_13" data-id="P12_13">Be subject to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether to the king, as supreme;</span>

<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_19" data-id="P12_19">For this is acceptable, if for conscience toward God a man endureth griefs, suffering wrongfully.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_20" data-id="P12_20">For what glory is it, if, when ye sin, and are buffeted <span class="add">for it</span>, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer <span class="add">for it</span>, ye shall take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_21" data-id="P12_21">For hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that ye should follow his steps: </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_22" data-id="P12_22">who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_23" data-id="P12_23">who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, threatened not; but committed <span class="add">himself</span> to him that judgeth righteously: </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_24" data-id="P12_24">who his own self bare our sins in his body upon the tree, that we, having died unto sins, might live unto righteousness; by whose stripes ye were healed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_25" data-id="P12_25">For ye were going astray like sheep; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</span>
