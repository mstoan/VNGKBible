<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_1" data-id="P12_1">Putting away therefore all wickedness, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_2" data-id="P12_2">as newborn babes, long for the spiritual milk which is without guile, that ye may grow thereby unto salvation;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_3" data-id="P12_3">if ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious:</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_4" data-id="P12_4">unto whom coming, a living stone, rejected indeed of men, but with God elect, precious,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_5" data-id="P12_5">ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_6" data-id="P12_6">Because it is contained in scripture,</span>

<div class="q">
<span class="v P12_6" data-id="P12_6">Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v P12_6" data-id="P12_6">And he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_7" data-id="P12_7">For you therefore that believe is the preciousness: but for such as disbelieve,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v P12_7" data-id="P12_7">The stone which the builders rejected,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v P12_7" data-id="P12_7">The same was made the head of the corner;</span>

</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v P12_8" data-id="P12_8">A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence;</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v P12_8" data-id="P12_8">for they stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_9" data-id="P12_9">But ye are an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for <span class="add">God’s</span> own possession, that ye may show forth the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_10" data-id="P12_10">who in time past were no people, but now are the people of God: who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_11" data-id="P12_11">Beloved, I beseech you as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_12" data-id="P12_12">having your behavior seemly among the Gentiles; that, wherein they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_13" data-id="P12_13">Be subject to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether to the king, as supreme;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_14" data-id="P12_14">or unto governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to them that do well.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_15" data-id="P12_15">For so is the will of God, that by well-doing ye should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_16" data-id="P12_16">as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_17" data-id="P12_17">Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_18" data-id="P12_18">Servants, <span class="add">be</span> in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_19" data-id="P12_19">For this is acceptable, if for conscience toward God a man endureth griefs, suffering wrongfully.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_20" data-id="P12_20">For what glory is it, if, when ye sin, and are buffeted <span class="add">for it</span>, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer <span class="add">for it</span>, ye shall take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_21" data-id="P12_21">For hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that ye should follow his steps: </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_22" data-id="P12_22">who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_23" data-id="P12_23">who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, threatened not; but committed <span class="add">himself</span> to him that judgeth righteously: </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_24" data-id="P12_24">who his own self bare our sins in his body upon the tree, that we, having died unto sins, might live unto righteousness; by whose stripes ye were healed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v P12_25" data-id="P12_25">For ye were going astray like sheep; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</span>
