<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_1" data-id="JM3_1">Be not many <span class="add">of you</span> teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive heavier judgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_2" data-id="JM3_2">For in many things we all stumble. If any stumbleth not in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_3" data-id="JM3_3">Now if we put the horsesâ€™ bridles into their mouths that they may obey us, we turn about their whole body also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_4" data-id="JM3_4">Behold, the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by rough winds, are yet turned about by a very small rudder, whither the impulse of the steersman willeth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_5" data-id="JM3_5">So the tongue also is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how much wood is kindled by how small a fire!</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_6" data-id="JM3_6">And the tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the wheel of nature, and is set on fire by hell.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_7" data-id="JM3_7">For every kind of beasts and birds, of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_8" data-id="JM3_8">but the tongue can no man tame; <span class="add">it is</span> a restless evil, <span class="add">it is</span> full of deadly poison. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_9" data-id="JM3_9">Therewith bless we the Lord and Father; and therewith curse we men, who are made after the likeness of God:</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_10" data-id="JM3_10">out of the same mouth cometh forth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_11" data-id="JM3_11">Doth the fountain send forth from the same opening sweet <span class="add">water </span> and bitter? </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_12" data-id="JM3_12">Can a fig tree, my brethren, yield olives, or a vine figs? neither <span class="add">can</span> salt water yield sweet. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_13" data-id="JM3_13">Who is wise and understanding among you? let him show by his good life his works in meekness of wisdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_14" data-id="JM3_14">But if ye have bitter jealousy and faction in your heart, glory not and lie not against the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_15" data-id="JM3_15">This wisdom is not <span class="add">a wisdom</span> that cometh down from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_16" data-id="JM3_16">For where jealousy and faction are, there is confusion and every vile deed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_17" data-id="JM3_17">But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without variance, without hypocrisy. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_18" data-id="JM3_18">And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for them that make peace.</span>
