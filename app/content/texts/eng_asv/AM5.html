<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_1" data-id="AM5_1">Hear ye this word which I take up for a lamentation over you, O house of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_2" data-id="AM5_2">The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is cast down upon her land; there is none to raise her up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_3" data-id="AM5_3">For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left, and that which went forth a hundred shall have ten left, to the house of Israel. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_4" data-id="AM5_4">For thus saith Jehovah unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_5" data-id="AM5_5">but seek not Beth-el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth-el shall come to nought. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_6" data-id="AM5_6">Seek Jehovah, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and it devour, and there be none to quench it in Beth-el. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_7" data-id="AM5_7">Ye who turn justice to wormwood, and cast down righteousness to the earth,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_8" data-id="AM5_8"> <span class="add">seek him</span> that maketh the Pleiades and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night; that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth (Jehovah is his name); </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_9" data-id="AM5_9">that bringeth sudden destruction upon the strong, so that destruction cometh upon the fortress.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_10" data-id="AM5_10">They hate him that reproveth in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_11" data-id="AM5_11">Forasmuch therefore as ye trample upon the poor, and take exactions from him of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink the wine thereof.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_12" data-id="AM5_12">For I know how manifold are your transgressions, and how mighty are your sins-ye that afflict the just, that take a bribe, and that turn aside the needy in the gate <span class="add">from their right</span>. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_13" data-id="AM5_13">Therefore he that is prudent shall keep silence in such a time; for it is an evil time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_14" data-id="AM5_14">Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live; and so Jehovah, the God of hosts, will be with you, as ye say.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_15" data-id="AM5_15">Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish justice in the gate: it may be that Jehovah, the God of hosts, will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_16" data-id="AM5_16">Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the Lord: Wailing shall be in all the broad ways; and they shall say in all the streets, Alas! Alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful in lamentation to wailing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_17" data-id="AM5_17">And in all vineyards shall be wailing; for I will pass through the midst of thee, saith Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_18" data-id="AM5_18">Woe unto you that desire the day of Jehovah! Wherefore would ye have the day of Jehovah? It is darkness, and not light.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_19" data-id="AM5_19">As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_20" data-id="AM5_20">Shall not the day of Jehovah be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_21" data-id="AM5_21">I hate, I despise your feasts, and I will take no delight in your solemn assemblies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_22" data-id="AM5_22">Yea, though ye offer me your burnt-offerings and meal-offerings, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your fat beasts. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_23" data-id="AM5_23">Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_24" data-id="AM5_24">But let justice roll down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_25" data-id="AM5_25">Did ye bring unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_26" data-id="AM5_26">Yea, ye have borne the tabernacle of your king and the shrine of your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM5_27" data-id="AM5_27">Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith Jehovah, whose name is the God of hosts.</span>
