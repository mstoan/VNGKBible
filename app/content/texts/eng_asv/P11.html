<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_2" data-id="P11_2">according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_3" data-id="P11_3">Blessed <span class="add">be</span> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy begat us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_4" data-id="P11_4">unto an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_5" data-id="P11_5">who by the power of God are guarded through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_6" data-id="P11_6">Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, ye have been put to grief in manifold trials,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_7" data-id="P11_7">that the proof of your faith, <span class="add">being</span> more precious than gold that perisheth though it is proved by fire, may be found unto praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_8" data-id="P11_8">whom not having seen ye love; on whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory: </span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_10" data-id="P11_10">Concerning which salvation the prophets sought and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that <span class="add">should come</span> unto you: </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_11" data-id="P11_11">searching what <span class="add">time</span> or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did point unto, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should follow them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_12" data-id="P11_12">To whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto you, did they minister these things, which now have been announced unto you through them that preached the gospel unto you by the Holy Spirit sent forth from heaven; which things angels desire to look into. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_13" data-id="P11_13">Wherefore girding up the loins of your mind, be sober and set your hope perfectly on the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_14" data-id="P11_14">as children of obedience, not fashioning yourselves according to your former lusts in <span class="add">the time of</span> your ignorance: </span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_18" data-id="P11_18">knowing that ye were redeemed, not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers; </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_19" data-id="P11_19">but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, <span class="add">even the blood </span> of Christ: </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_20" data-id="P11_20">who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but was manifested at the end of the times for your sake,</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_21" data-id="P11_21">who through him are believers in God, that raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; so that your faith and hope might be in God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_22" data-id="P11_22">Seeing ye have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth unto unfeigned love of the brethren, love one another from the heart fervently: </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_23" data-id="P11_23">having been begotten again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God, which liveth and abideth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_24" data-id="P11_24">For, All flesh is as grass, And all the glory thereof as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower falleth: </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_25" data-id="P11_25">But the word of the Lord abideth for ever. And this is the word of good tidings which was preached unto you.</span>
