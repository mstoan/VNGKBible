<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_1" data-id="T23_1">But know this, that in the last days grievous times shall come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_2" data-id="T23_2">For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, railers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_3" data-id="T23_3">without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_4" data-id="T23_4">traitors, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_5" data-id="T23_5">holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power thereof: from these also turn away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_6" data-id="T23_6">For of these are they that creep into houses, and take captive silly women laden with sins, led away by divers lusts,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_7" data-id="T23_7">ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_8" data-id="T23_8">And even as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth; men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_9" data-id="T23_9">But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be evident unto all men, as theirs also came to be.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_10" data-id="T23_10">But thou didst follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_11" data-id="T23_11">persecutions, sufferings; what things befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: and out of them all the Lord delivered me. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_12" data-id="T23_12">Yea, and all that would live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_13" data-id="T23_13">But evil men and impostors shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_14" data-id="T23_14">But abide thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_15" data-id="T23_15">and that from a babe thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_16" data-id="T23_16">Every scripture inspired of God <span class="add">is</span> also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness: </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_17" data-id="T23_17">that the man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto every good work.</span>
