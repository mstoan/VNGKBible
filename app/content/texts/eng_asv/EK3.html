<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_1" data-id="EK3_1">And he said unto me, Son of man, eat that which thou findest; eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_2" data-id="EK3_2">So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the roll.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_3" data-id="EK3_3">And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_4" data-id="EK3_4">And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_5" data-id="EK3_5">For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_6" data-id="EK3_6">not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, if I sent thee to them, they would hearken unto thee. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_7" data-id="EK3_7">But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are of hard forehead and of a stiff heart. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_8" data-id="EK3_8">Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_9" data-id="EK3_9">As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_10" data-id="EK3_10">Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_11" data-id="EK3_11">And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_12" data-id="EK3_12">Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, <span class="add">saying</span>, Blessed be the glory of Jehovah from his place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_13" data-id="EK3_13">And <span class="add">I heard</span> the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_14" data-id="EK3_14">So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_15" data-id="EK3_15">Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and to where they dwelt; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_16" data-id="EK3_16">And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_17" data-id="EK3_17">Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_18" data-id="EK3_18">When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_19" data-id="EK3_19">Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_20" data-id="EK3_20">Again, when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_21" data-id="EK3_21">Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_22" data-id="EK3_22">And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_23" data-id="EK3_23">Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of Jehovah stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_24" data-id="EK3_24">Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thy house. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_25" data-id="EK3_25">But thou, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them: </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_26" data-id="EK3_26">and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK3_27" data-id="EK3_27">But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.</span>
