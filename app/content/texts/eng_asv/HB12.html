<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_1" data-id="HB12_1">Therefore let us also, seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_2" data-id="HB12_2">looking unto Jesus the author and perfecter of <span class="add">our</span> faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising shame, and hath sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_3" data-id="HB12_3">For consider him that hath endured such gainsaying of sinners against himself, that ye wax not weary, fainting in your souls. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_4" data-id="HB12_4">Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_5" data-id="HB12_5">and ye have forgotten the exhortation which reasoneth with you as with sons,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB12_5" data-id="HB12_5">My son, regard not lightly the chastening of the Lord,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB12_5" data-id="HB12_5">Nor faint when thou art reproved of him;</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_6" data-id="HB12_6">For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB12_6" data-id="HB12_6">And scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_7" data-id="HB12_7">It is for chastening that ye endure; God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is there whom <span class="add">his</span> father chasteneth not? </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_8" data-id="HB12_8">But if ye are without chastening, whereof all have been made partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_9" data-id="HB12_9">Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live? </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_10" data-id="HB12_10">For they indeed for a few days chastened <span class="add">us</span> as seemed good to them; but he for <span class="add">our</span> profit, that <span class="add">we</span> may be partakers of his holiness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_11" data-id="HB12_11">All chastening seemeth for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yieldeth peaceable fruit unto them that have been exercised thereby, <span class="add">even the fruit</span> of righteousness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_12" data-id="HB12_12">Wherefore lift up the hands that hang down, and the palsied knees;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_13" data-id="HB12_13">and make straight paths for your feet, that that which is lame be not turned out of the way, but rather be healed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_14" data-id="HB12_14">Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man shall see the Lord:</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_15" data-id="HB12_15">looking carefully lest <span class="add">there be</span> any man that falleth short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble <span class="add">you</span>, and thereby the many be defiled;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_16" data-id="HB12_16">lest <span class="add">there be</span> any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one mess of meat sold his own birthright.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_17" data-id="HB12_17">For ye know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place for a change of mind <span class="add">in his father,</span> though he sought it diligently with tears.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_18" data-id="HB12_18">For ye are not come unto <span class="add">a mount</span> that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest, </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_19" data-id="HB12_19">and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which <span class="add">voice </span> they that heard entreated that no word more should be spoken unto them;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_20" data-id="HB12_20">for they could not endure that which was enjoined, If even a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_21" data-id="HB12_21">and so fearful was the appearance, <span class="add">that</span> Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_22" data-id="HB12_22">but ye are come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable hosts of angels, </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_23" data-id="HB12_23">to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_24" data-id="HB12_24">and to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better than <span class="add">that of</span> Abel. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_25" data-id="HB12_25">See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not when they refused him that warned <span class="add">them</span> on earth, much more <span class="add">shall not</span> we <span class="add">escape</span> who turn away from him that <span class="add">warneth </span> from heaven: </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_26" data-id="HB12_26">whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more will I make to tremble not the earth only, but also the heaven. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_27" data-id="HB12_27">And this <span class="add">word</span>, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain. </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_28" data-id="HB12_28">Wherefore, receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us have grace, whereby we may offer service well-pleasing to God with reverence and awe: </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_29" data-id="HB12_29">for our God is a consuming fire.</span>
