<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_4" data-id="K18_4">And they brought up the ark of Jehovah, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; even these did the priests and the Levites bring up. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_5" data-id="K18_5">And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_6" data-id="K18_6">And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim. </span>
