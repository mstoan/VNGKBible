<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_2" data-id="EK43_2">And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shined with his glory. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_3" data-id="EK43_3">And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_4" data-id="EK43_4">And the glory of Jehovah came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_5" data-id="EK43_5">And the Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_7" data-id="EK43_7">And he said unto me, Son of man, <span class="add">this is</span> the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever. And the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, and by the dead bodies of their kings <span class="add">in</span> their high places; </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_8" data-id="EK43_8">in their setting of their threshold by my threshold, and their door-post beside my door-post, and there was <span class="add">but</span> the wall between me and them; and they have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_9" data-id="EK43_9">Now let them put away their whoredom, and the dead bodies of their kings, far from me; and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever. </span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_18" data-id="EK43_18">And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_19" data-id="EK43_19">Thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that are of the seed of Zadok, who are near unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord Jehovah, a young bullock for a sin-offering. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_20" data-id="EK43_20">And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the ledge, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse it and make atonement for it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_21" data-id="EK43_21">Thou shalt also take the bullock of the sin-offering, and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_22" data-id="EK43_22">And on the second day thou shalt offer a he-goat without blemish for a sin-offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_23" data-id="EK43_23">When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_24" data-id="EK43_24">And thou shalt bring them near before Jehovah, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_25" data-id="EK43_25">Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin-offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK43_26" data-id="EK43_26">Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it; so shall they consecrate it.</span>
