<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_12" data-id="S12_12">Now the sons of Eli were base men; they knew not Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_13" data-id="S12_13">And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_14" data-id="S12_14">and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_15" data-id="S12_15">Yea, before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled flesh of thee, but raw. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_16" data-id="S12_16">And if the man said unto him, They will surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would say, Nay, but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_17" data-id="S12_17">And the sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah; for the men despised the offering of Jehovah.</span>

<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_20" data-id="S12_20">And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Jehovah give thee seed of this woman for the petition which was asked of Jehovah. And they went unto their own home. </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_22" data-id="S12_22">Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with the women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_23" data-id="S12_23">And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_24" data-id="S12_24">Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make Jehovah’s people to transgress.</span>

<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_28" data-id="S12_28">and did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up unto mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_29" data-id="S12_29">Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in <span class="add">my</span> habitation, and honorest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people? </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_30" data-id="S12_30">Therefore Jehovah, the God of Israel, saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now Jehovah saith, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_31" data-id="S12_31">Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house. </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_32" data-id="S12_32">And thou shalt behold the affliction of <span class="add">my</span> habitation, in all the wealth which <span class="add">God</span> shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_33" data-id="S12_33">And the man of thine, <span class="add">whom</span> I shall not cut off from mine altar, <span class="add">shall be</span> to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thy heart; and all the increase of thy house shall die in the flower of their age. </span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_34" data-id="S12_34">And this shall be the sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_35" data-id="S12_35">And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_36" data-id="S12_36">And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.</span>
