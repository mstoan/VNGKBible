<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_13" data-id="S12_13">And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand;</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_14" data-id="S12_14">and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_15" data-id="S12_15">Yea, before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled flesh of thee, but raw. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_16" data-id="S12_16">And if the man said unto him, They will surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would say, Nay, but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_17" data-id="S12_17">And the sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah; for the men despised the offering of Jehovah.</span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_22" data-id="S12_22">Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with the women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_23" data-id="S12_23">And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_24" data-id="S12_24">Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make Jehovah’s people to transgress.</span>

<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_29" data-id="S12_29">Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in <span class="add">my</span> habitation, and honorest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people? </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_30" data-id="S12_30">Therefore Jehovah, the God of Israel, saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now Jehovah saith, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_31" data-id="S12_31">Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house. </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_32" data-id="S12_32">And thou shalt behold the affliction of <span class="add">my</span> habitation, in all the wealth which <span class="add">God</span> shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_33" data-id="S12_33">And the man of thine, <span class="add">whom</span> I shall not cut off from mine altar, <span class="add">shall be</span> to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thy heart; and all the increase of thy house shall die in the flower of their age. </span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_34" data-id="S12_34">And this shall be the sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_35" data-id="S12_35">And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v S12_36" data-id="S12_36">And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.</span>
