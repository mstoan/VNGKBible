<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_1" data-id="C12_1">And I, brethren, when I came unto you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_2" data-id="C12_2">For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_3" data-id="C12_3">And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_4" data-id="C12_4">And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_5" data-id="C12_5">that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_6" data-id="C12_6">We speak wisdom, however, among them that are fullgrown: yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nought: </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_7" data-id="C12_7">but we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, <span class="add">even</span> the <span class="add">wisdom </span> that hath been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds unto our glory:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_8" data-id="C12_8">which none of the rulers of this world hath known: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_9" data-id="C12_9">but as it is written,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v C12_9" data-id="C12_9">Things which eye saw not, and ear heard not,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v C12_9" data-id="C12_9">And <span class="add">which</span> entered not into the heart of man,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v C12_9" data-id="C12_9">Whatsoever things God prepared for them that love him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_10" data-id="C12_10">But unto us God revealed <span class="add">them</span> through the Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_11" data-id="C12_11">For who among men knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of the man, which is in him? even so the things of God none knoweth, save the Spirit of God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_12" data-id="C12_12">But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God; that we might know the things that were freely given to us of God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_13" data-id="C12_13">Which things also we speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Spirit teacheth; combining spiritual things with spiritual <span class="add">words</span>. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_14" data-id="C12_14">Now the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him; and he cannot know them, because they are spiritually judged. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_15" data-id="C12_15">But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, and he himself is judged of no man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_16" data-id="C12_16">For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</span>
