<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_1" data-id="IS61_1">The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me; because Jehovah hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening <span class="add">of the prison</span> to them that are bound; </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_2" data-id="IS61_2">to proclaim the year of Jehovahâ€™s favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_3" data-id="IS61_3">to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be called trees of righteousness, the planting of Jehovah, that he may be glorified. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_4" data-id="IS61_4">And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_5" data-id="IS61_5">And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners shall be your plowmen and your vine-dressers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_6" data-id="IS61_6">But ye shall be named the priests of Jehovah; men shall call you the ministers of our God: ye shall eat the wealth of the nations, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_7" data-id="IS61_7">Instead of your shame <span class="add">ye shall have</span> double; and instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess double; everlasting joy shall be unto them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_8" data-id="IS61_8">For I, Jehovah, love justice, I hate robbery with iniquity; and I will give them their recompense in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_9" data-id="IS61_9">And their seed shall be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples; all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which Jehovah hath blessed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_10" data-id="IS61_10">I will greatly rejoice in Jehovah, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with a garland, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS61_11" data-id="IS61_11">For as the earth bringeth forth its bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord Jehovah will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.</span>
