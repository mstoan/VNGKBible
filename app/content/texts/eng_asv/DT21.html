<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_1" data-id="DT21_1">If one be found slain in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath smitten him; </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_2" data-id="DT21_2">then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain: </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_3" data-id="DT21_3">and it shall be, that the city which is nearest unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_4" data-id="DT21_4">and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heiferâ€™s neck there in the valley. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_5" data-id="DT21_5">And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them Jehovah thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of Jehovah; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_6" data-id="DT21_6">And all the elders of that city, who are nearest unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley; </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_7" data-id="DT21_7">and they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_8" data-id="DT21_8">Forgive, O Jehovah, thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and suffer not innocent blood <span class="add">to remain</span> in the midst of thy people Israel. And the blood shall be forgiven them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_9" data-id="DT21_9">So shalt thou put away the innocent blood from the midst of thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah. </span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_10" data-id="DT21_10">When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and Jehovah thy God delivereth them into thy hands, and thou carriest them away captive, </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_11" data-id="DT21_11">and seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_12" data-id="DT21_12">then thou shalt bring her home to thy house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_13" data-id="DT21_13">and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thy house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_14" data-id="DT21_14">And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not deal with her as a slave, because thou hast humbled her.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_15" data-id="DT21_15">If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the first-born son be hers that was hated; </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_16" data-id="DT21_16">then it shall be, in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved the first-born before the son of the hated, who is the first-born:</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_17" data-id="DT21_17">but he shall acknowledge the first-born, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath; for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the first-born is his.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_18" data-id="DT21_18">If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, that will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and, though they chasten him, will not hearken unto them; </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_19" data-id="DT21_19">then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_20" data-id="DT21_20">and they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_21" data-id="DT21_21">And all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee; and all Israel shall hear, and fear. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_22" data-id="DT21_22">And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree;</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT21_23" data-id="DT21_23">his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt surely bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is accursed of God; that thou defile not thy land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.</span>
