<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_2" data-id="K119_2">Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to-morrow about this time. </span>

<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_4" data-id="K119_4">But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper-tree: and he requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is enough; now, O Jehovah, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_5" data-id="K119_5">And he lay down and slept under a juniper-tree; and, behold, an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_6" data-id="K119_6">And he looked, and, behold, there was at his head a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_7" data-id="K119_7">And the angel of Jehovah came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat, because the journey is too great for thee. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_8" data-id="K119_8">And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God. </span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_9" data-id="K119_9">And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of Jehovah came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah? </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_10" data-id="K119_10">And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah, the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword: and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_11" data-id="K119_11">And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before Jehovah. And, behold, Jehovah passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before Jehovah; but Jehovah was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but Jehovah was not in the earthquake: </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_12" data-id="K119_12">and after the earthquake a fire; but Jehovah was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_13" data-id="K119_13">And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_14" data-id="K119_14">And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah, the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away. </span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_16" data-id="K119_16">and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel; and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_17" data-id="K119_17">And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay; and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_18" data-id="K119_18">Yet will I leave <span class="add">me</span> seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him. </span>
