<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN8_1" data-id="GN8_1">And God remembered Noah, and all the beasts, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged; </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN8_2" data-id="GN8_2">the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN8_3" data-id="GN8_3">and the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased. </span>

<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN8_5" data-id="GN8_5">And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. </span>

<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN8_6" data-id="GN8_6">And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN8_7" data-id="GN8_7">and he sent forth a raven, and it went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN8_8" data-id="GN8_8">And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN8_9" data-id="GN8_9">but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him to the ark; for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her in unto him into the ark.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN8_10" data-id="GN8_10">And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN8_14" data-id="GN8_14">And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dry.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN8_15" data-id="GN8_15">And God spake unto Noah, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN8_16" data-id="GN8_16">Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons’ wives with thee.</span>

<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN8_20" data-id="GN8_20">And Noah builded an altar unto Jehovah, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN8_21" data-id="GN8_21">And Jehovah smelled the sweet savor; and Jehovah said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake, for that the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more everything living, as I have done. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN8_22" data-id="GN8_22">While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease. </span>
