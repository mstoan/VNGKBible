<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN8_2" data-id="GN8_2">the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN8_3" data-id="GN8_3">and the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased. </span>

<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN8_6" data-id="GN8_6">And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN8_7" data-id="GN8_7">and he sent forth a raven, and it went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN8_8" data-id="GN8_8">And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN8_9" data-id="GN8_9">but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him to the ark; for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her in unto him into the ark.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN8_10" data-id="GN8_10">And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;</span>
