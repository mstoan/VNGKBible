<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_1" data-id="JS24_1">And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_2" data-id="JS24_2">And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt of old time beyond the River, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor: and they served other gods.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_3" data-id="JS24_3">And I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_4" data-id="JS24_4">And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; and Jacob and his children went down into Egypt. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_5" data-id="JS24_5">And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did in the midst thereof: and afterward I brought you out. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_6" data-id="JS24_6">And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and with horsemen unto the Red Sea. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_7" data-id="JS24_7">And when they cried out unto Jehovah, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness many days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_8" data-id="JS24_8">And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, that dwelt beyond the Jordan: and they fought with you; and I gave them into your hand, and ye possessed their land; and I destroyed them from before you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_9" data-id="JS24_9">Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel: and he sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you; </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_10" data-id="JS24_10">but I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_11" data-id="JS24_11">And ye went over the Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your hand. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_12" data-id="JS24_12">And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; not with thy sword, nor with thy bow. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_13" data-id="JS24_13">And I gave you a land whereon thou hadst not labored, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell therein; of vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_14" data-id="JS24_14">Now therefore fear Jehovah, and serve him in sincerity and in truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt; and serve ye Jehovah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_15" data-id="JS24_15">And if it seem evil unto you to serve Jehovah, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_16" data-id="JS24_16">And the people answered and said, Far be it from us that we should forsake Jehovah, to serve other gods;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_17" data-id="JS24_17">for Jehovah our God, he it is that brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and that did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the peoples through the midst of whom we passed; </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_18" data-id="JS24_18">and Jehovah drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites that dwelt in the land: therefore we also will serve Jehovah; for he is our God. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_19" data-id="JS24_19">And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve Jehovah; for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgression nor your sins. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_20" data-id="JS24_20">If ye forsake Jehovah, and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you evil, and consume you, after that he hath done you good. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_21" data-id="JS24_21">And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_22" data-id="JS24_22">And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you Jehovah, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_23" data-id="JS24_23">Now therefore put away, <span class="add">said he</span>, the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto Jehovah, the God of Israel. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_24" data-id="JS24_24">And the people said unto Joshua, Jehovah our God will we serve, and unto his voice will we hearken.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_25" data-id="JS24_25">So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_26" data-id="JS24_26">And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Jehovah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_27" data-id="JS24_27">And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it hath heard all the words of Jehovah which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness against you, lest ye deny your God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_28" data-id="JS24_28">So Joshua sent the people away, every man unto his inheritance.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_29" data-id="JS24_29">And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, being a hundred and ten years old. </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_30" data-id="JS24_30">And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash. </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_31" data-id="JS24_31">And Israel served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and had known all the work of Jehovah, that he had wrought for Israel. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_32" data-id="JS24_32">And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money: and they became the inheritance of the children of Joseph. </span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JS24_33" data-id="JS24_33">And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill-country of Ephraim. </span>
