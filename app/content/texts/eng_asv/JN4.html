<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_1" data-id="JN4_1">When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_2" data-id="JN4_2">(although Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples),</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_3" data-id="JN4_3">he left Judæa, and departed again into Galilee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_4" data-id="JN4_4">And he must needs pass through Samaria.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_5" data-id="JN4_5">So he cometh to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_6" data-id="JN4_6">and Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_7" data-id="JN4_7">There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_8" data-id="JN4_8">For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_9" data-id="JN4_9">The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.) </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_10" data-id="JN4_10">Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_11" data-id="JN4_11">The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou that living water? </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_12" data-id="JN4_12">Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_13" data-id="JN4_13">Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_14" data-id="JN4_14">but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_15" data-id="JN4_15">The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_16" data-id="JN4_16">Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_17" data-id="JN4_17">The woman answered and said unto him, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no husband:</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_18" data-id="JN4_18">for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_19" data-id="JN4_19">The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_20" data-id="JN4_20">Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_21" data-id="JN4_21">Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_22" data-id="JN4_22">Ye worship that which ye know not: we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_23" data-id="JN4_23">But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_24" data-id="JN4_24">God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_25" data-id="JN4_25">The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh (he that is called Christ): when he is come, he will declare unto us all things. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_26" data-id="JN4_26">Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am <span class="add">he</span>.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_27" data-id="JN4_27">And upon this came his disciples; and they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her? </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_28" data-id="JN4_28">So the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and saith to the people,</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_29" data-id="JN4_29">Come, see a man, who told me all things that <span class="add">ever</span> I did: can this be the Christ?</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_30" data-id="JN4_30">They went out of the city, and were coming to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_31" data-id="JN4_31">In the mean while the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_32" data-id="JN4_32">But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_33" data-id="JN4_33">The disciples therefore said one to another, Hath any man brought him <span class="add">aught</span> to eat? </span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_34" data-id="JN4_34">Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_35" data-id="JN4_35">Say not ye, There are yet four months, and <span class="add">then</span> cometh the harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white already unto harvest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_36" data-id="JN4_36">He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. </span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_37" data-id="JN4_37">For herein is the saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_38" data-id="JN4_38">I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored: others have labored, and ye are entered into their labor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_39" data-id="JN4_39">And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all things that <span class="add">ever </span> I did. </span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_40" data-id="JN4_40">So when the Samaritans came unto him, they besought him to abide with them: and he abode there two days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_41" data-id="JN4_41">And many more believed because of his word;</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_42" data-id="JN4_42">and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world. </span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_43" data-id="JN4_43">And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_44" data-id="JN4_44">For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honor in his own country.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_45" data-id="JN4_45">So when he came into Galilee, the Galilæans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast. </span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_46" data-id="JN4_46">He came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. </span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_47" data-id="JN4_47">When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judæa into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought <span class="add">him</span> that he would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_48" data-id="JN4_48">Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_49" data-id="JN4_49">The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_50" data-id="JN4_50">Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him, and he went his way. </span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_51" data-id="JN4_51">And as he was now going down, his servants met him, saying, that his son lived.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_52" data-id="JN4_52">So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_53" data-id="JN4_53">So the father knew that <span class="add">it was</span> at that hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house. </span>
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN4_54" data-id="JN4_54">This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judæa into Galilee.</span>
