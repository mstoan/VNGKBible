<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS21_1" data-id="IS21_1">The burden of the wilderness of the sea. As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it cometh from the wilderness, from a terrible land. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS21_2" data-id="IS21_2">A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous man dealeth treacherously, and the destroyer destroyeth. Go up, O Elam; besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS21_3" data-id="IS21_3">Therefore are my loins filled with anguish; pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman in travail: I am pained so that I cannot hear; I am dismayed so that I cannot see. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS21_4" data-id="IS21_4">My heart fluttereth, horror hath affrighted me; the twilight that I desired hath been turned into trembling unto me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS21_5" data-id="IS21_5">They prepare the table, they set the watch, they eat, they drink: rise up, ye princes, anoint the shield.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS21_6" data-id="IS21_6">For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman: let him declare what he seeth:</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS21_7" data-id="IS21_7">and when he seeth a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of asses, a troop of camels, he shall hearken diligently with much heed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS21_8" data-id="IS21_8">And he cried as a lion: O Lord, I stand continually upon the watch-tower in the day-time, and am set in my ward whole nights; </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS21_9" data-id="IS21_9">and, behold, here cometh a troop of men, horsemen in pairs. And he answered and said, Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the graven images of her gods are broken unto the ground. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS21_10" data-id="IS21_10">O thou my threshing, and the grain of my floor! that which I have heard from Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS21_11" data-id="IS21_11">The burden of Dumah. One calleth unto me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS21_12" data-id="IS21_12">The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will inquire, inquire ye: turn ye, come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS21_13" data-id="IS21_13">The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye caravans of Dedanites.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS21_14" data-id="IS21_14">Unto him that was thirsty they brought water; the inhabitants of the land of Tema did meet the fugitives with their bread. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS21_15" data-id="IS21_15">For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS21_16" data-id="IS21_16">For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, all the glory of Kedar shall fail; </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v IS21_17" data-id="IS21_17">and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be few; for Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath spoken it. </span>
