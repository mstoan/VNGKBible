<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_1" data-id="HS9_1">Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, like the peoples; for thou hast played the harlot, <span class="add">departing</span> from thy God; thou hast loved hire upon every grain-floor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_2" data-id="HS9_2">The threshing-floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_3" data-id="HS9_3">They shall not dwell in Jehovah’s land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean food in Assyria.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_4" data-id="HS9_4">They shall not pour out wine-offerings to Jehovah, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted; for their bread shall be for their appetite; it shall not come into the house of Jehovah. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_5" data-id="HS9_5">What will ye do in the day of solemn assembly, and in the day of the feast of Jehovah?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_6" data-id="HS9_6">For, lo, they are gone away from destruction; <span class="add">yet</span> Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them; their pleasant things of silver, nettles shall possess them; thorns shall be in their tents.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_7" data-id="HS9_7">The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the man that hath the spirit is mad, for the abundance of thine iniquity, and because the enmity is great.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_8" data-id="HS9_8">Ephraim <span class="add">was</span> a watchman with my God: as for the prophet, a fowler’s snare is in all his ways, <span class="add">and</span> enmity in the house of his God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_9" data-id="HS9_9">They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_10" data-id="HS9_10">I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the first-ripe in the fig-tree at its first season: but they came to Baal-peor, and consecrated themselves unto the shameful thing, and became abominable like that which they loved. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_11" data-id="HS9_11">As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird: there shall be no birth, and none with child, and no conception.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_12" data-id="HS9_12">Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, so that not a man shall be left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them! </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_13" data-id="HS9_13">Ephraim, like as I have seen Tyre, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring out his children to the slayer. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_14" data-id="HS9_14">Give them, O Jehovah-what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_15" data-id="HS9_15">All their wickedness is in Gilgal; for there I hated them: because of the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of my house; I will love them no more; all their princes are revolters.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_16" data-id="HS9_16">Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay the beloved fruit of their womb. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HS9_17" data-id="HS9_17">My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him; and they shall be wanderers among the nations.</span>
