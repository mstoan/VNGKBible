<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_1" data-id="T11_1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Saviour, and Christ Jesus our hope;</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_2" data-id="T11_2">unto Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_3" data-id="T11_3">As I exhorted thee to tarry at Ephesus, when I was going into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge certain men not to teach a different doctrine, </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_4" data-id="T11_4">neither to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questionings, rather than a dispensation of God which is in faith; <span class="add">so do I now</span>. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_5" data-id="T11_5">But the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned:</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_6" data-id="T11_6">from which things some having swerved have turned aside unto vain talking;</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_7" data-id="T11_7">desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor whereof they confidently affirm.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_8" data-id="T11_8">But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_9" data-id="T11_9">as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_10" data-id="T11_10">for fornicators, for abusers of themselves with men, for menstealers, for liars, for false swearers, and if there be any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine; </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_11" data-id="T11_11">according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_12" data-id="T11_12">I thank him that enabled me, <span class="add">even</span> Christ Jesus our Lord, for that he counted me faithful, appointing me to <span class="add">his</span> service; </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_13" data-id="T11_13">though I was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: howbeit I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief; </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_14" data-id="T11_14">and the grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_15" data-id="T11_15">Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief: </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_16" data-id="T11_16">howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me as chief might Jesus Christ show forth all his longsuffering, for an ensample of them that should thereafter believe on him unto eternal life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_17" data-id="T11_17">Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, <span class="add">be</span> honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_18" data-id="T11_18">This charge I commit unto thee, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which led the way to thee, that by them thou mayest war the good warfare; </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_19" data-id="T11_19">holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust from them made shipwreck concerning the faith:</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v T11_20" data-id="T11_20">of whom is Hymen√¶us and Alexander; whom I delivered unto Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.</span>
