<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_1" data-id="AM7_1">Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king’s mowings. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_2" data-id="AM7_2">And it came to pass that, when they made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord Jehovah, forgive, I beseech thee: how shall Jacob stand? for he is small. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_3" data-id="AM7_3">Jehovah repented concerning this: It shall not be, saith Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_4" data-id="AM7_4">Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, the Lord Jehovah called to content by fire; and it devoured the great deep, and would have eaten up the land. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_5" data-id="AM7_5">Then said I, O Lord Jehovah, cease, I beseech thee: how shall Jacob stand? for he is small.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_6" data-id="AM7_6">Jehovah repented concerning this: this also shall not be, saith the Lord Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_7" data-id="AM7_7">Thus he showed me: and, behold, the Lord stood beside a wall made by a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_8" data-id="AM7_8">And Jehovah said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumb-line. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel; I will not again pass by them any more;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_9" data-id="AM7_9">and the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_10" data-id="AM7_10">Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_11" data-id="AM7_11">For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_12" data-id="AM7_12">Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thou away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there: </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_13" data-id="AM7_13">but prophesy not again any more at Beth-el; for it is the king’s sanctuary, and it is a royal house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_14" data-id="AM7_14">Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was a herdsman, and a dresser of sycomore-trees: </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_15" data-id="AM7_15">and Jehovah took me from following the flock, and Jehovah said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_16" data-id="AM7_16">Now therefore hear thou the word of Jehovah: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not <span class="add">thy word</span> against the house of Isaac; </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AM7_17" data-id="AM7_17">therefore thus saith Jehovah: Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou thyself shalt die in a land that is unclean, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land. </span>
