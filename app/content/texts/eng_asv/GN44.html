<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_1" data-id="GN44_1">And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money in his sack’s mouth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_2" data-id="GN44_2">And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his grain money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_3" data-id="GN44_3">As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_4" data-id="GN44_4"> <span class="add">And</span> when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_5" data-id="GN44_5">Is not this that in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_6" data-id="GN44_6">And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these words.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_7" data-id="GN44_7">And they said unto him, Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? Far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_8" data-id="GN44_8">Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold? </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_9" data-id="GN44_9">With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord’s bondmen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_10" data-id="GN44_10">And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my bondman; and ye shall be blameless. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_11" data-id="GN44_11">Then they hasted, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_12" data-id="GN44_12">And he searched, <span class="add">and</span> began at the eldest, and left off at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_13" data-id="GN44_13">Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_14" data-id="GN44_14">And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; and he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_15" data-id="GN44_15">And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? know ye not that such a man as I can indeed divine?</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_16" data-id="GN44_16">And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord’s bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_17" data-id="GN44_17">And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_18" data-id="GN44_18">Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh, my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_19" data-id="GN44_19">My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_20" data-id="GN44_20">And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loveth him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_21" data-id="GN44_21">And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_22" data-id="GN44_22">And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_23" data-id="GN44_23">And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_24" data-id="GN44_24">And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_25" data-id="GN44_25">And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_26" data-id="GN44_26">And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the man’s face, except our youngest brother be with us. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_27" data-id="GN44_27">And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_28" data-id="GN44_28">and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since:</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_29" data-id="GN44_29">and if ye take this one also from me, and harm befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_30" data-id="GN44_30">Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s life; </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_31" data-id="GN44_31">it will come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not <span class="add">with us</span>, that he will die: and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_32" data-id="GN44_32">For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever. </span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_33" data-id="GN44_33">Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. </span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN44_34" data-id="GN44_34">For how shall I go up to my father, if the lad be not with me? lest I see the evil that shall come on my father.</span>
