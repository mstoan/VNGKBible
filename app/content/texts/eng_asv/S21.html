<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_1" data-id="S21_1">And it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_2" data-id="S21_2">it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_3" data-id="S21_3">And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_4" data-id="S21_4">And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_5" data-id="S21_5">And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_6" data-id="S21_6">And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_7" data-id="S21_7">And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_8" data-id="S21_8">And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_9" data-id="S21_9">And he said unto me, Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and slay me; for anguish hath taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_10" data-id="S21_10">So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_11" data-id="S21_11">Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_12" data-id="S21_12">and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_13" data-id="S21_13">And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_14" data-id="S21_14">And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy Jehovah’s anointed?</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_15" data-id="S21_15">And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him, so that he died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_16" data-id="S21_16">And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain Jehovah’s anointed. </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_17" data-id="S21_17">And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son</span>
