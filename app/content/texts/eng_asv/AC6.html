<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_1" data-id="AC6_1">Now in these days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a murmuring of the Grecian Jews against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_2" data-id="AC6_2">And the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not fit that we should forsake the word of God, and serve tables. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_3" data-id="AC6_3">Look ye out therefore, brethren, from among you seven men of good report, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_4" data-id="AC6_4">But we will continue stedfastly in prayer, and in the ministry of the word.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_5" data-id="AC6_5">And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus a proselyte of Antioch;</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_6" data-id="AC6_6">whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands upon them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_7" data-id="AC6_7">And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_8" data-id="AC6_8">And Stephen, full of grace and power, wrought great wonders and signs among the people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_9" data-id="AC6_9">But there arose certain of them that were of the synagogue called <span class="add">the synagogue</span> of the Libertines, and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_10" data-id="AC6_10">And they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_11" data-id="AC6_11">Then they suborned men, who said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and <span class="add">against</span> God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_12" data-id="AC6_12">And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and seized him, and brought him into the council, </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_13" data-id="AC6_13">and set up false witnesses, who said, This man ceaseth not to speak words against this holy place, and the law:</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_14" data-id="AC6_14">for we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered unto us. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_15" data-id="AC6_15">And all that sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.</span>
