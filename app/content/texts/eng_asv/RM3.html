<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_19" data-id="RM3_19">Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it speaketh to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God:</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_20" data-id="RM3_20">because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight; for through the law <span class="add">cometh</span> the knowledge of sin. </span>

<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_26" data-id="RM3_26">for the showing, <span class="add">I say</span>, of his righteousness at this present season: that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him that hath faith in Jesus. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM3_27" data-id="RM3_27">Where then is the glorying? It is excluded. By what manner of law? of works? Nay: but by a law of faith.</span>
