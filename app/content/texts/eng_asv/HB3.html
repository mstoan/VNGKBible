<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_1" data-id="HB3_1">Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, <span class="add">even</span> Jesus; </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_2" data-id="HB3_2">who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_3" data-id="HB3_3">For he hath been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as he that built the house hath more honor than the house. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_4" data-id="HB3_4">For every house is builded by some one; but he that built all things is God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_5" data-id="HB3_5">And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken; </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_6" data-id="HB3_6">but Christ as a son, over his house; whose house are we, if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of our hope firm unto the end. </span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_13" data-id="HB3_13">but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called To-day; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin: </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_14" data-id="HB3_14">for we are become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end:</span>
