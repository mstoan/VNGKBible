<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_1" data-id="JN12_1">Jesus therefore six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_2" data-id="JN12_2">So they made him a supper there: and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_3" data-id="JN12_3">Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_4" data-id="JN12_4">But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, that should betray him, saith,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_5" data-id="JN12_5">Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred shillings, and given to the poor?</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_6" data-id="JN12_6">Now this he said, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the bag took away what was put therein. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_7" data-id="JN12_7">Jesus therefore said, Suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_8" data-id="JN12_8">For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_9" data-id="JN12_9">The common people therefore of the Jews learned that he was there: and they came, not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_10" data-id="JN12_10">But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to death;</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_11" data-id="JN12_11">because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_12" data-id="JN12_12">On the morrow a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_13" data-id="JN12_13">took the branches of the palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna: Blessed <span class="add">is</span> he that cometh in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_14" data-id="JN12_14">And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_15" data-id="JN12_15">Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_16" data-id="JN12_16">These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_17" data-id="JN12_17">The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bare witness. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_18" data-id="JN12_18">For this cause also the multitude went and met him, for that they heard that he had done this sign.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_19" data-id="JN12_19">The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Behold how ye prevail nothing: lo, the world is gone after him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_20" data-id="JN12_20">Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast:</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_21" data-id="JN12_21">these therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_22" data-id="JN12_22">Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: Andrew cometh, and Philip, and they tell Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_23" data-id="JN12_23">And Jesus answereth them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_24" data-id="JN12_24">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it abideth by itself alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_25" data-id="JN12_25">He that loveth his life loseth it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_26" data-id="JN12_26">If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will the Father honor. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_27" data-id="JN12_27">Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause came I unto this hour.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_28" data-id="JN12_28">Father, glorify thy name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven, <span class="add">saying</span>, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_29" data-id="JN12_29">The multitude therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it had thundered: others said, An angel hath spoken to him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_30" data-id="JN12_30">Jesus answered and said, This voice hath not come for my sake, but for your sakes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_31" data-id="JN12_31">Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_32" data-id="JN12_32">And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto myself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_33" data-id="JN12_33">But this he said, signifying by what manner of death he should die.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_34" data-id="JN12_34">The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man? </span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_35" data-id="JN12_35">Jesus therefore said unto them, Yet a little while is the light among you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness overtake you not: and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_36" data-id="JN12_36">While ye have the light, believe on the light, that ye may become sons of light. These things spake Jesus, and he departed and hid himself from them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_37" data-id="JN12_37">But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they believed not on him:</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_38" data-id="JN12_38">that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v JN12_38" data-id="JN12_38">Lord, who hath believed our report?</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v JN12_38" data-id="JN12_38">And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_39" data-id="JN12_39">For this cause they could not believe, for that Isaiah said again,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_40" data-id="JN12_40">He hath blinded their eyes, and he hardened their heart;</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v JN12_40" data-id="JN12_40">Lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v JN12_40" data-id="JN12_40">And should turn,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v JN12_40" data-id="JN12_40">And I should heal them.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_41" data-id="JN12_41">These things said Isaiah, because he saw his glory; and he spake of him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_42" data-id="JN12_42">Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess <span class="add">it</span>, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: </span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_43" data-id="JN12_43">for they loved the glory <span class="add">that is</span> of men more than the glory <span class="add">that is</span> of God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_44" data-id="JN12_44">And Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_45" data-id="JN12_45">And he that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_46" data-id="JN12_46">I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in the darkness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_47" data-id="JN12_47">And if any man hear my sayings, and keep them not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. </span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_48" data-id="JN12_48">He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my sayings, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I spake, the same shall judge him in the last day. </span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_49" data-id="JN12_49">For I spake not from myself; but the Father that sent me, he hath given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. </span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v JN12_50" data-id="JN12_50">And I know that his commandment is life eternal: the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father hath said unto me, so I speak. </span>
