<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_1" data-id="S13_1">And the child Samuel ministered unto Jehovah before Eli. And the word of Jehovah was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_2" data-id="S13_2">And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to wax dim, so that he could not see), </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_3" data-id="S13_3">and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down <span class="add">to sleep</span>, in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_4" data-id="S13_4">that Jehovah called Samuel: and he said, Here am I.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_5" data-id="S13_5">And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_6" data-id="S13_6">And Jehovah called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_7" data-id="S13_7">Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither was the word of Jehovah yet revealed unto him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_8" data-id="S13_8">And Jehovah called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah had called the child. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_9" data-id="S13_9">Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Jehovah; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_10" data-id="S13_10">And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant heareth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_11" data-id="S13_11">And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_12" data-id="S13_12">In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even unto the end.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_13" data-id="S13_13">For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse upon themselves, and he restrained them not. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_14" data-id="S13_14">And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eliâ€™s house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering for ever. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_15" data-id="S13_15">And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_16" data-id="S13_16">Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_17" data-id="S13_17">And he said, What is the thing that <span class="add">Jehovah</span> hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide anything from me of all the things that he spake unto thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_18" data-id="S13_18">And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is Jehovah: let him do what seemeth him good.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_19" data-id="S13_19">And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_20" data-id="S13_20">And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Jehovah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v S13_21" data-id="S13_21">And Jehovah appeared again in Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.</span>
