<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_1" data-id="T14_1">But the Spirit saith expressly, that in later times some shall fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons, </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_2" data-id="T14_2">through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_3" data-id="T14_3">forbidding to marry, <span class="add">and commanding</span> to abstain from meats, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by them that believe and know the truth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_4" data-id="T14_4">For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it be received with thanksgiving:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_5" data-id="T14_5">for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_6" data-id="T14_6">If thou put the brethren in mind of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which thou hast followed <span class="add">until now</span>: </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_7" data-id="T14_7">but refuse profane and old wives’ fables. And exercise thyself unto godliness:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_8" data-id="T14_8">for bodily exercise is profitable for a little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life which now is, and of that which is to come. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_9" data-id="T14_9">Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_10" data-id="T14_10">For to this end we labor and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_11" data-id="T14_11">These things command and teach.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_12" data-id="T14_12">Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an ensample to them that believe, in word, in manner of life, in love, in faith, in purity. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_13" data-id="T14_13">Till I come, give heed to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_14" data-id="T14_14">Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_15" data-id="T14_15">Be diligent in these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy progress may be manifest unto all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T14_16" data-id="T14_16">Take heed to thyself, and to thy teaching. Continue in these things; for in doing this thou shalt save both thyself and them that hear thee. </span>
