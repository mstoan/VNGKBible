<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU5_7" data-id="NU5_7">then he shall confess his sin which he hath done: and he shall make restitution for his guilt in full, and add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him in respect of whom he hath been guilty.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU5_8" data-id="NU5_8">But if the man have no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt which is made unto Jehovah shall be the priest’s; besides the ram of the atonement, whereby atonement shall be made for him.</span>
