<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_1" data-id="C16_1">Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_2" data-id="C16_2">Or know ye not that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world is judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_3" data-id="C16_3">Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more, things that pertain to this life?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_4" data-id="C16_4">If then ye have to judge things pertaining to this life, do ye set them to judge who are of no account in the church?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_5" data-id="C16_5">I say <span class="add">this</span> to move you to shame. What, cannot there be <span class="add">found</span> among you one wise man who shall be able to decide between his brethren,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_6" data-id="C16_6">but brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_7" data-id="C16_7">Nay, already it is altogether a defect in you, that ye have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather take wrong? why not rather be defrauded? </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_8" data-id="C16_8">Nay, but ye yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that <span class="add">your </span> brethren. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_9" data-id="C16_9">Or know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_10" data-id="C16_10">nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_11" data-id="C16_11">And such were some of you: but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_12" data-id="C16_12">All things are lawful for me; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under the power of any. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_13" data-id="C16_13">Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall bring to nought both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body: </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_14" data-id="C16_14">and God both raised the Lord, and will raise up us through his power.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_15" data-id="C16_15">Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ? shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? God forbid. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_16" data-id="C16_16">Or know ye not that he that is joined to a harlot is one body? for, The twain, saith he, shall become one flesh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_17" data-id="C16_17">But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_18" data-id="C16_18">Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_19" data-id="C16_19">Or know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have from God? and ye are not your own; </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C16_20" data-id="C16_20">for ye were bought with a price: glorify God therefore in your body.</span>
