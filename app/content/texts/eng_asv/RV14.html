<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_1" data-id="RV14_1">And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on the mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty and four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_2" data-id="RV14_2">And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and the voice which I heard <span class="add">was</span> as <span class="add">the voice</span> of harpers harping with their harps:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_3" data-id="RV14_3">and they sing as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders: and no man could learn the song save the hundred and forty and four thousand, <span class="add">even</span> they that had been purchased out of the earth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_4" data-id="RV14_4">These are they that were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These <span class="add">are</span> they that follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were purchased from among men, <span class="add">to be</span> the firstfruits unto God and unto the Lamb. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_5" data-id="RV14_5">And in their mouth was found no lie: they are without blemish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_6" data-id="RV14_6">And I saw another angel flying in mid heaven, having eternal good tidings to proclaim unto them that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation and tribe and tongue and people; </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_7" data-id="RV14_7">and he saith with a great voice, Fear God, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_8" data-id="RV14_8">And another, a second angel, followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, that hath made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_9" data-id="RV14_9">And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, If any man worshippeth the beast and his image, and receiveth a mark on his forehead, or upon his hand, </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_10" data-id="RV14_10">he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_11" data-id="RV14_11">and the smoke of their torment goeth up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, they that worship the beast and his image, and whoso receiveth the mark of his name. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_12" data-id="RV14_12">Here is the patience of the saints, they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_13" data-id="RV14_13">And I heard a voice from heaven saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth: yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_14" data-id="RV14_14">And I saw, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud <span class="add">I saw </span> one sitting like unto a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp a sickle.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_15" data-id="RV14_15">And another angel came out from the temple, crying with a great voice to him that sat on the cloud, Send forth thy sickle, and reap: for the hour to reap is come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_16" data-id="RV14_16">And he that sat on the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_17" data-id="RV14_17">And another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_18" data-id="RV14_18">And another angel came out from the altar, he that hath power over fire; and he called with a great voice to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_19" data-id="RV14_19">And the angel cast his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and cast it into the winepress, the great <span class="add">winepress</span>, of the wrath of God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV14_20" data-id="RV14_20">And the winepress was trodden without the city, and there came out blood from the winepress, even unto the bridles of the horses, as far as a thousand and six hundred furlongs. </span>
