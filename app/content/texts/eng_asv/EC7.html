<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_1" data-id="EC7_1">A <span class="add">good</span> name is better than precious oil; and the day of death, than the day of oneâ€™s birth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_2" data-id="EC7_2">It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_3" data-id="EC7_3">Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made glad.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_4" data-id="EC7_4">The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_5" data-id="EC7_5">It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_6" data-id="EC7_6">For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_7" data-id="EC7_7">Surely extortion maketh the wise man foolish; and a bribe destroyeth the understanding.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_8" data-id="EC7_8">Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof; <span class="add">and </span> the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_9" data-id="EC7_9">Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry; for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_10" data-id="EC7_10">Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_11" data-id="EC7_11">Wisdom is as good as an inheritance; yea, more excellent is it for them that see the sun.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_12" data-id="EC7_12">For wisdom is a defence, even as money is a defence; but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom preserveth the life of him that hath it. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_13" data-id="EC7_13">Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_14" data-id="EC7_14">In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider; yea, God hath made the one side by side with the other, to the end that man should not find out anything <span class="add">that shall be</span> after him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_15" data-id="EC7_15">All this have I seen in my days of vanity: there is a righteous man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth <span class="add">his life</span> in his evil-doing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_16" data-id="EC7_16">Be not righteous overmuch; neither make thyself overwise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_17" data-id="EC7_17">Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_18" data-id="EC7_18">It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from that withdraw not thy hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth from them all. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_19" data-id="EC7_19">Wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers that are in a city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_20" data-id="EC7_20">Surely there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_21" data-id="EC7_21">Also take not heed unto all words that are spoken, lest thou hear thy servant curse thee;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_22" data-id="EC7_22">for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_23" data-id="EC7_23">All this have I proved in wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_24" data-id="EC7_24">That which is, is far off and exceeding deep; who can find it out?</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_25" data-id="EC7_25">I turned about, and my heart <span class="add">was set</span> to know and to search out, and to seek wisdom and the reason <span class="add">of things</span>, and to know that wickedness is folly, and that foolishness is madness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_26" data-id="EC7_26">And I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, <span class="add">and</span> whose hands are bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_27" data-id="EC7_27">Behold, this have I found, saith the Preacher, <span class="add">laying</span> one thing to another, to find out the account;</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_28" data-id="EC7_28">which my soul still seeketh, but I have not found: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found. </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC7_29" data-id="EC7_29">Behold, this only have I found: that God made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.</span>
