<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_1" data-id="HB10_1">For the law having a shadow of the good <span class="add">things</span> to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect them that draw nigh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_2" data-id="HB10_2">Else would they not have ceased to be offered? because the worshippers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_3" data-id="HB10_3">But in those <span class="add">sacrifices</span> there is a remembrance made of sins year by year.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_4" data-id="HB10_4">For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_7" data-id="HB10_7">Then said I, Lo, I am come (In the roll of the book it is written of me)</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_9" data-id="HB10_9">then hath he said, Lo, I am come to do thy will. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_11" data-id="HB10_11">And every priest indeed standeth day by day ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, the which can never take away sins: </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_12" data-id="HB10_12">but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_13" data-id="HB10_13">henceforth expecting till his enemies be made the footstool of his feet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_14" data-id="HB10_14">For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_15" data-id="HB10_15">And the Holy Spirit also beareth witness to us; for after he hath said,</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_18" data-id="HB10_18">Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_19" data-id="HB10_19">Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_20" data-id="HB10_20">by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_21" data-id="HB10_21">and <span class="add">having</span> a great priest over the house of God;</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_22" data-id="HB10_22">let us draw near with a true heart in fulness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience: and having our body washed with pure water, </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_23" data-id="HB10_23">let us hold fast the confession of our hope that it waver not; for he is faithful that promised:</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_24" data-id="HB10_24">and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works;</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_25" data-id="HB10_25">not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting <span class="add">one another</span>; and so much the more, as ye see the day drawing nigh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_26" data-id="HB10_26">For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more a sacrifice for sins, </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_27" data-id="HB10_27">but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which shall devour the adversaries.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_28" data-id="HB10_28">A man that hath set at nought Mosesâ€™ law dieth without compassion on <span class="add">the word of</span> two or three witnesses: </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_29" data-id="HB10_29">of how much sorer punishment, think ye, shall he be judged worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_30" data-id="HB10_30">For we know him that said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_31" data-id="HB10_31">It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_32" data-id="HB10_32">But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were enlightened, ye endured a great conflict of sufferings;</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_33" data-id="HB10_33">partly, being made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, becoming partakers with them that were so used. </span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_34" data-id="HB10_34">For ye both had compassion on them that were in bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your possessions, knowing that ye have for yourselves a better possession and an abiding one. </span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_35" data-id="HB10_35">Cast not away therefore your boldness, which hath great recompense of reward.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_36" data-id="HB10_36">For ye have need of patience, that, having done the will of God, ye may receive the promise.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_37" data-id="HB10_37">For yet a very little while,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB10_37" data-id="HB10_37">He that cometh shall come, and shall not tarry.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_38" data-id="HB10_38">But my righteous one shall live by faith:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB10_38" data-id="HB10_38">And if he shrink back, my soul hath no pleasure in him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_39" data-id="HB10_39">But we are not of them that shrink back unto perdition; but of them that have faith unto the saving of the soul.</span>
