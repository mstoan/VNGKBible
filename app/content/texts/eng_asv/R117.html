<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_1" data-id="R117_1">And it came to pass, when David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Jehovah <span class="add">dwelleth</span> under curtains.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_2" data-id="R117_2">And Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thy heart; for God is with thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_3" data-id="R117_3">And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_4" data-id="R117_4">Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith Jehovah, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in:</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_5" data-id="R117_5">for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, unto this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from <span class="add">one</span> tabernacle <span class="add">to another</span>. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_6" data-id="R117_6">In all places wherein I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_7" data-id="R117_7">Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people Israel:</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_8" data-id="R117_8">and I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_9" data-id="R117_9">And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_10" data-id="R117_10">and <span class="add">as</span> from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all thine enemies. Moreover I tell thee that Jehovah will build thee a house. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_11" data-id="R117_11">And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_12" data-id="R117_12">He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_13" data-id="R117_13">I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my lovingkindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee; </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_14" data-id="R117_14">but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_15" data-id="R117_15">According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_16" data-id="R117_16">Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far? </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_17" data-id="R117_17">And this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; but thou hast spoken of thy servant’s house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Jehovah God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_18" data-id="R117_18">What can David <span class="add">say</span> yet more unto thee concerning the honor which is done to thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_19" data-id="R117_19">O Jehovah, for thy servant’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make known all <span class="add">these</span> great things. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_20" data-id="R117_20">O Jehovah, there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_21" data-id="R117_21">And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, to make thee a name by great and terrible things, in driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou redeemest out of Egypt?</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_22" data-id="R117_22">For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, Jehovah, becamest their God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_23" data-id="R117_23">And now, O Jehovah, let the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast spoken. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_24" data-id="R117_24">And let thy name be established and magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and the house of David thy servant is established before thee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_25" data-id="R117_25">For thou, O my God, hast revealed to thy servant that thou wilt build him a house: therefore hath thy servant found <span class="add">in his heart</span> to pray before thee. </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_26" data-id="R117_26">And now, O Jehovah, thou art God, and hast promised this good thing unto thy servant:</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v R117_27" data-id="R117_27">and now it hath pleased thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Jehovah, hast blessed, and it is blessed for ever. </span>
