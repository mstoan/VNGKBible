<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S29_2" data-id="S29_2">And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him unto David; and the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S29_3" data-id="S29_3">And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, who is lame of his feet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S29_4" data-id="S29_4">And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar. </span>
